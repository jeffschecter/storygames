If all goes well, I'm planning to run a campaign using the Westmark extended example set out in An Echo Resounding (AER). This is essentially a D&amp;D translation of the factions section in Stars Without Number (SWN).<br/><br/>I like the economy it creates for large-scale military, financial and social power. I like the idea of a dynamic background region to set dungeons in, as well as the promise that adventurers can rise to greater political power without going deaf to the call for adventure.<br/><br/>I've two questions.<br/><br/>1) Does the DW Beta have any discussion on creating fronts at the regional level, i.e. cities, towns, armies, etc? <br/>Something like a Campaign Front: not direct threats to the adventurers but more background issues that create adventure hooks. I guess like Factions in SWN. The example Westmark locations developed in AER are great, though their description could\xa0be usefully reduced if written as a Front.<br/><br/>2) Are their any DW rules or moves for mass combat, i.e. engagement of armies with units of 100 soldiers? <br/>AER uses combat rules from the Labyrinth Lord, which looks exactly like D&amp;D 2nd edition to me. I've some ideas on how to convert it to DW system, but I'm kinda of stuck with missile combat. The DW Hack &amp; Slash works like a charm at the large scale of mass combat, but DW Volley doesn't work when dealing with 100 soldiers; at least I think running out of ammo isn't really an option for a unit of 100 archers whose sole purpose is to shoot arrows.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371682/#Comment_371682" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T07:39:44+00:00" title="April  7, 2012  7:39AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Planarch Codex is going to have what are essentially SWN's faction rules translated for DW, but that section is still being worked on.

But i do like that the AER system allows for players to lead their own forces and resolve battles using the same system. To do this with DW would require more structure than other MC moves and monster moves.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>The Planarch Codex is going to have what are essentially SWN's faction rules translated for DW, but that section is still being worked on.  I actually checked this thread partially in the hope that somebody had already done that!</blockquote>AER takes SWN factions and tweaks as medieval domains. It has lots of tables for cities, towns, ruins, and lairs; all with tags, assets and obstacles that fit the DW genre. It's not designed with DW in mind but (i) the approach for designing the colour of a region is very nice, and (ii) the overall economy of domains, that is essentially the economy to actually establish and maintain a large military force, can sit nicely over other systems without too much issue, if ruling a domain does not takeover from adventuring as the bread and butter of game play. <br/><br/>I'm considering using AER as written, though I am intrigued by the potential of simplifying and jazzing up mass combat procedures with DW-style moves. On the other end, the stats for a location, like a city or ruin, are built up from the assets they possess and the military units those assets support. It's structurally very fair and thorough, though at times can be a little cumbersome to calculate or adjust.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SineNomine</cite>Plainly, I'm gonna have to get Dungeon World so I can offer my own suggestions on the matter. It certainly sounds like fun.</blockquote>The Beta 2 rules, which contain the steadings rules, are only available through the Adventurer's guild, entry to which is gained through posting actual play reports of DW sessions. You may want to ask DW designers though for an exeception if it meant getting your perspective on the design of DW, particularly any ideas from AER that could inform DW. I think there's a wealth of ideas in AER.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371802/#Comment_371802" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T06:36:44+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  6:36AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 7:22AM by mease19.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The designers give you broad authority to customize the game.

Make custom moves that suit the scale of the mass battle you want to play out. The nifty thing you can do as well is 'zoom in' if required to highlight a particular unit or individual in the battle (Heroic units or PC's for instance) and narrate in some moves at the macro level that then may effect the broader moves snowball. The game could be at the company level for instance, using the rules for large gangs in the advanced combat section of AW. During a particularly vicious foray the GM decides on a miss that the general's guard is surrounded and under threat of rout and either surrender for ransom or death before dishonour. The action zooms in to the individual level.... The PCs (the general and his entourage) narrate in moves at the individual level. Can this sway the battle? Heroics and grand strategy. Awesome fun. I think Caeser's suggestion of the Regiment is spot on too, just scale out as needed, making sure that you design moves that touch on all 6 stats, thus encouraging things other than simple military manoeuvring to win the battle. In this vein, the hardhold rules from AW could easily be adapted to a fantasy 'city' level, along with the Operator's and Maestro 'd as examples for spy networks and political shenanigans, you could have a grand game in the making.<br/><br/>Also, I think that the rules for campaign fronts in DW are spot on. You are encouraged to design 'big picture' factions that if left unchecked could create all sorts of world-shaking events.\n<blockquote>Tying your Adventure Fronts together is your Campaign Front. While the Adventure Fronts will contain immediate Dangers\u2014the Orcs in Hargrosh Pass, say\u2014the Campaign Front contains the Dark God Grishkar who drives the Orcs to their pillaging. The Campaign Front is the unifying element that spans your all the sessions of your Dungeon World game. It will have slower\u2014burning Portents but they\u2019ll be bigger in scope and have a deeper impact on the world. Most importantly they'll be scarier if they're allowed to resolve.</blockquote>\nedit: Oh I just had a thought. Volley works fine at the unit level if you consider the narration before the move. Why would you lose 1 ammo when you are a missile unit? Assume that they have at least 3 ammo to begin with (they are missile units after all). What a fantastic hook! Use the fiction already established to guide you, If you are a generous GM, maybe you ask the players to elaborate. Perhaps the archers are being charged by heavy horse so they unleash a rain of hell into the armoured ranks, using up 1 ammo in the process. Maybe a nearby ogre battleforce breaks through the line and tramples all over the pickets, smashing into splinters the prepared arrows that have been plunged into the moist earth. Maybe they are firing at a wizard, and his spell of retaliation is a whirlwind tempest that sends all the flying arrows askew, requiring much more concentrated fire to be effective.<br/><br/>My point is that just because you are focusing on a broad scale, doesn't mean that the principles are neglected. Fiction first always. instigate moves as the fiction requires, and elaborate the results of the moves with fictional ramifications that in turn are re-incorporated as much as possible. To do it, do it, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371851/#Comment_371851" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T19:36:12+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  7:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 7:41PM by mease19.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Archers are a specialized asset.

We're trying to focus on adventurers going on adventures for Dungeon World, but we've certainly tossed around ideas (call it Advanced Dungeon World) for that kind of stuff. I wouldn't hold out hopes of seeing it any time soon though, it's just something Adam and I toss around when we get bored.<br/><br/>You can handle mass combat with the rules as written, or you could do like Marshall shows and make your own moves. Going with the rules as written you'd use GM moves (soft ones) since no player moves apply. This is actually a great resource: if the players do something and you don't know how to respond (its not a player move) just make a GM move. In mass combat I can see putting the players in a spot where they have to choose between an objective or many lives (and other resources) lost, or telling them the requirements (you'll need a whole extra brigade of men to do it).<br/><br/>As far as managing factions we don't have anything much like SWN (which I love) just because our focus has been on the smaller scale. As was mentioned up thread we do have a simple system for managing the broader world, but that's maybe not as proactive as you want. It's designed to show the effects of fronts and the players' actions, not show factions clashing with each other. Of course a faction could be a front, but I think you're looking for something a little different.<br/><br/>Sorry, that's probably not the most helpful response. It boils down to "we don't have a great answer yet, but it's certainly a cool thing and we'd love to see it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372019/#Comment_372019" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T18:27:22+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  6:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks. This thread has been informative. I understand that DW is focused toward adventuring, but I'm just charged with idea of combining  DW with something like AER.<br/><br/>I really like Sage's suggestion of using GM moves when player's do something I don't know how to respond to. Good advice generally. However, I do want something a little more proactive than the GM moves for mass conflicts, especially for resolving battles that are form more of background than main focus of the game. As Sage picked out, I am currently more interested in dealing with factions or domains clashing with each other to create a dynamic broader world, than with battles involving PCs. Something resolved once a session rather than as a part of an adventure itself.<br/><br/>Of course, with large conflicts happening throughout the region, PCs will almost inevitably be drawn into battle at some point, so aligning any mass conflict rules with standard DW would be really useful. This is exactly what the above moves suggestions give, including those in the Regiment, and they're great. But at this stage, I'm more looking for rules for mass conflicts that don't rely on PCs leading or fighting in the battle.<br/><br/>I totally agree with fiction first approach. Indeed, that was the issue I had with using volley for a unit of 100 archers. If the archers are in a walled fort, shooting from towers at an enemy in the fields who are about to engage with foot soldiers, it seems implausible the archers will run out of arrows during that single engagement. The Regiment gave me some ideas, perhaps unit volleys can suppress or damage enemies on 7-9, maybe friendly fire...<br/><br/>"One move = one battle" could work fine for resolving background battles. War is always a risky business, fog of war and all that. I certainly don't need to go through each battle in detail, but I'd want the move to adequately reflect the benefits of having better military units and for putting in the effort to systematically build a regional economy to support that military using AER. A standard roll+modifier should work, probably extrapolating from how gang fights work, but I just can't quite see how yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372039/#Comment_372039" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T20:02:00+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  8:02PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 8:05PM by Noofy.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: watergoesred</cite> However, I do want something a little more proactive than the GM moves for mass conflicts, especially for resolving battles that are form more of background than main focus of the game. As Sage picked out, I am currently more interested in dealing with factions or domains clashing with each other to create a dynamic broader world, than with battles involving PCs. Something resolved once a session rather than as a part of an adventure itself.</blockquote>\nI think this may  be the disconnect. If the player's aren't invested in the fiction of the battle, if it is in the background as domains clashing, then there is little reason to author in a player move. The GM can make moves certainly, but they are not die-dependent on the miss /soft hit / hard hit paradigm of player moves. You end up playing out a mass war 'mini-game' that has no bearing on the PC's playbooks, moves or bonds (which flag the game). I think the solution is to tie these two together. Similar to linked tests in BW, when you can 'scale back' a PC roll (or test) to influence the broader situation and carry +1 forward to the subsequent conflict, which in turn effects the battle. You need to imbed the fiction within the players situation to make them care and thus need to make moves and roll. Otherwise it just becomes an exercise of 'play some mass combat game' with little connection to what the players care about (as protagonised through the lens of their characters).<br/><br/>For instance, the PC's are mid level, have scoured a few dungeons and unearthered an unholy plot that involves the Master of Clay utilising his bloodstone Idol at the head of Battlemoore's armies (lead by the Black Gauntlet) to take over the neighbouring kingdoms. As the invading force gathers momentum, the elves of the glimmering woods desperately mount a defence in the vale of regret...... Now, the PC's home steading is Battlemoore, the thief has high level ties with the Spanterhook guild, who in turn has fingers in all the pies of the merchant's collective (the Black Guantlet). The cleric is aligned with the god of death (a minor cult in Battlemoore), but has paladins of his faith leading the armies of Grundloch. The elven fighter's home is under threat as the two forces clash on the verge of her home, and despite being outcast, she still harbours regret that her family may be slaughtered. The wizard has disguised himself after Grundloch usurped the wizard's college in Battlemoore, executed the collegium heads and declared any wizard who does not swear allegiance an outlaw. He has some dirt on Grundloch collected from his laboratory under the mountain that may come in handy.The PC's are naturally disposed against Grundloch after he trounced them in the Halls under the hill, but lacking the resources to tackle him head on or the desire to be a part of the impeding battle have different plans....<br/><br/>So as the armies move toward a climactic factional battle 'in the background',  the end result of which you have no idea of as its one of your stakes - and you are playing to see what happens - how to the PC's narrate moves that effect the outcome?<br/><br/>Perhaps the thief calls in favours with the guild, using the leverage of the Eye of Entrax to enlist the duplicitous orc tribe as a third faction to the battle. <b>Parley<i></i></b> or <b>Connections<i></i></b>.<br/>The Wizard might search for other wizards hiding in the nearby villages and towns to collect a rebellious faction of magical fortitude.<b> Defy Danger <i></i></b>using CHA. The threat being that Grundloch's goon squad discovers him and hauls him up for execution.<br/>The Cleric's goddess' petitions is by trail of combat and gaining secrets, and the domain is that of Knowledge and Hidden Things, so she plans on leading the Paladins into battle hoping to discover the secret of the Bloodstone Idol and grant her goddess' boon of <b>divine guidance<i></i></b> (whilst simultaneously avoiding slaughtering the elvish kinsfolk of her adventuring companion). She also has the move <b>Orison for Guidance</b> and can't wait to narrate it into the story when appropriate.<br/>Lastly the fighter hopes to discourage her kin from fighting at all, suggesting they retreat and call in an ancient dwarven alliance from the Stonewall. <b>Spout Lore <i></i></b>with a carry forward to<b> Parley<i></i></b> with the elders, her leverage being her knowledge of underhand mercantile transactions with both the thieves guild and the Black Gauntlet. She also hopes to author her <b>Blacksmith</b> move, destroying the Eye of Entrax if possible in the elven forge and imbuing her signature double-ended spear with its nefarious magical powers. If successful, the battle may be delayed, the odds evened, an adventure to Stonewall in the making or any other countless fictional responses.<br/><br/>That way the battle is still 'in the background' and its resolution unknown, but the players have far more motivation to <b>care<i></i></b> and thus narrate actions which in turn cause moves that snowball and influence the outcome. If you or the players don't care about the battle or factional dispute, then why narrate its resolution into the story? Just make it a grim portent, adjust its effects accordingly and get on with roleplaying what matters to you and your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372066/#Comment_372066" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T04:41:58+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  4:41AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy, very thought-provoking post.  <br/><br/>You make excellent suggestions of how Moves can indirectly affect broader power struggles. They are excellent examples of how clashing domains could generate a chain reaction of chaos and disruption that cries out for heroic intervention. And this is some of the  benefit to embedding these broader power struggles in play early on, even when PCs are too weak to directly influence the local power structure. It it can set up long-term enmities and motivations for PCs to become powerful not just for personal gain but to make a difference for their communities. Characters could gain moves that directly influence the local power structures as advanced Moves or similar, a bit like at 9th level in AD&amp;D when PCs can gain followers or a fort or some such. <br/><br/>Where you've really sparked my interest is questioning what I really need to prep. Maybe a bunch of campaign stakes and a few grim portents mapped out are enough to create consistent background situation. Sounds promising, though is quite a departure from systematic way that AER manages domains and SWN factions. I just wonder what's lost by moving from a system for resolving political situations to one where stakes are set and resolved by the GM with little more than Moves.<br/><br/>It's true that AER can be a mini-game just for the GM to generate adventure hooks and create a consistent, changing world of politics and power. And of course, I agree that shouldn't involve domains that are distant and irrelevant to the characters and their story.<br/>On the other hand, only prepping for the things players care about is not always straightforward, given players' tendencies to do the unexpected. Systematically creating a broad, coherent and consistent political situation can help manage those unexpected moments in sandbox games that can throw GMs. <br/><br/>I note that SWN does use a single roll for faction attack, as opposed to AER's involved mass combat procedure. I guess this reflects the efficiencies of factions and sci-fi economies, compared to the inefficiency of sending out legions of soldiers to besiege your enemies. However, the scope of an attack action within a turn is more limited in SWN, whereas AER allows for entire cities to be raised in a single turn. Still, the single roll is appealing if only for the reduced handling time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372084/#Comment_372084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T07:25:16+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  7:25AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries Oliver! Its a great idea you have there. Two of my players have reached 'name' level in DW and are starting to effect the broader situational landscape in the ways I mentioned. If it ever comes to large scale battles I think I'll just stick with the rules as written (inclusive of the AW gang conflict stuff) and just 'zoom out' on the scale. I think a steading's defenses will count as its 'gang' size and I'll go with the fictional positioning variants listed in the optional battle moves section of AW.<br/><br/>I too like the idea of a one roll resolution, but the idea of zooming in to the troop level and making moves as the hero and thus relishing in the gritty, in your face, visceral combat and then move snowballing back out to the panoramic view of the battlefield is somewhat tempting and rather exciting as a situational concept for play.
