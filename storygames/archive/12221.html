I greatly enjoyed it, after skipping last year in favor of Fanime.<br/><br/>Even before the convention opened, Thursday night I ran <i>Zombies in the Vineyard</i>, but because a player arrived very late we got a late start and so overlapped <b>Ryan F Macklin</b>'s visit, sadly. After the game <b>Wilson Z</b> and I talked gaming for quite a bit, as is our way.<br/><br/>Friday evening in open gaming I ran the <i>Apocalypse World</i> "Blind Blue and Hatchet City" demo for 4 players in 5 hours, which ran better than for 5 players. The AW playbooks are too small to read well in dim light, but <b>John Harper'</b>s adult-sized character sheets were a lifesaver. Thanks John! We had so much fun we got together Saturday afternoon to continue (with a new player for Savannah, the Skinner, since we couldn't find the first player again). I'll avoid spoilers, but cannibalism was prevented, true love triumphed, and peaches preserved in honey were eaten very, very slowly.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon I went to <b>Jason Walters</b>' "Lords of the Wasteland" seminar on Apocalypse Gaming (he wrote portions of <b>Post-Apocalyptic Hero</b>), which was very interesting, with an intriguing list of references. He recorded it and said he'd look into posting it somewhere along with the bibliography. I've ordered a copy of Matthew Stein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Technology-Fails-Revised-Expanded/dp/1933392452/" rel="nofollow"><em>When Technology Fails</em></a>. I realize <i>Apocalypse World</i> plays fast and loose with details (bullets will last 50 years, but gasoline sure won't) but I think I'll find it useful for barfing forth apocalyptica, as the game demands.<br/><br/>Sunday evening Wilson had 8 players show up for his 4-person "Rural Dreams in a Small Town" <i>DRYH</i> game so I grabbed my kit and ran for the extra players in open gaming, knowing nothing but the title. We had a great time, Truth was sacrificed to save First Love, and the missing kids wound up in the arms of those who loved them. There was an opportunity to be a snow leopard that was thoughtfully declined, but life is full of choices. Afterwards I watched the end of Wilson's game and we compared notes until 2am. "Bedtime Stories" at Go Play NW 2008 is still my favorite <i>DRYH</i> game, but this was a very strong second.<br/><br/>There was also a vast amount of talking to interesting people in between the gaming. Monday I took advantage of late checkout, then hit a nearby comic store looking for more back issues of "Phonogram: Singles Club", and went home.<br/><br/>So far <i>Apocalypse World</i> is 2 for 2 in players wanting to play more after the demo, which is great, but it's still a heck of a lot of setup time before play kicks off. I'm hoping to run it again this Saturday at Endgame Oakland, and then next Saturday I'll be running the second session of the game I ran in late May. I also had an idea for a variant in which the PCs are all leaders of the Hardholder's various subgangs (Brainer in charge of Internal Security, <em>of course</em>), cooperating or fighting after an almost-successful assassination attempt.<br/><br/>So I had a lot of fun, and am intending to go back next year and try to sign up to run 4 or 6 games like I did in 2007 and 2008.<br/><br/>For others who went, how did it go for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
