It'll be in Maldor; we'll be making the characters then and there, so my prep needs to focus on what I'm interested in and what I can predict of my friends' interests.  I'm interested in using Key Elements, since they expand on my usual prep method (touchstone inspirations jotted down, and a lot of names names names).  My issue is, I haven't been able to track down much AP specifically addressing their use.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I want to know what experiences others have had using this method or something similar.  Any notes are great, but I'm wondering about how you reconcile your scene-framing rights with the introduction of Key Elements - if you aren't telling the players what they're looking for then is it a matter of them stumbling upon it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268418/#Comment_268418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T20:41:07+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  8:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Key Elements are rarely discussed - in fact, my understanding is that they're rarely used, at least in the sense of giving out xp for them. I relegated the rule into the "alternative" category in the SS booklet specifically because I only use it myself very occasionally (in fact, I used it in -08 the first time just to try it, I think), and haven't really seen any explicit discussion for or against the rule in public. Seems to me, if I'm allowed to speculate, that the relative disinterest is because most folks leave them out just like I do.<br/><br/>Still, I think that the rule has its uses: if you do elaborate set-piece prep, I've found it enjoyable to structure the preparation in the specifically disjointed manner advocated in the SS text; I don't need the reminder myself at this point, but I imagine that if you're used to "GM's story" type preparation, then the Key Element method will be useful in that it explicitly prevents story preparation when followed diligently. Another advantage is that your preparation is more honest and transparent when you make it explicit in the form of Key Elements, which helps the players perceive your role as a co-player instead of a fount of infinite wisdom - you'll note in the text that I recommend thinking of your prep holistically, interpreting anything and everything you prepare as Key Elements; the advantage to this, I've found, is that the players appreciate my cleverness more, and therefore the xp rewards I get to give out for Key Elements are actually rewards for myself, with the players being concretely notified to sit up and pay attention to my brilliant prep whenever they get Key Element xp.<br/><br/>Communicating Key Elements to the players is an interesting feature of this type of prep. Something I've done in this regard is to be very explicit about the Key Elements really existing as an itemized list - or even cards - that is not arbitrarily changed during the session and doesn't exist just in my head. (Usually I do all of my prep in my head when I do it, so this is a big deal for me.) This list can then be communicated to the players, and it sort of acts as a mechanics/fluff touchpoint in the same way game crunch does; you gain the benefit of underlining the game's processes by making it clear to the players when they're interacting with your prepared content, which is a similar perception effect to what you get by applying a special crunch rule on a fictional situation. Getting to know explicitly when you're interacting with an improvising SG and when you're interacting with pre-thought material changes the relationship between the player and the SG in an interesting manner, I find. I consider the practical facet of this to be similarly under SG freedom as general backstory narration is: you can choose to make the Key Elements list completely public, you can make it semi-public (have it there and point to it when it's used, but don't have the players actively examine it in advance), you can pace it (reveal only bits and pieces) or you can make it completely hidden. I've myself done the semi-public thing, mostly, but it's totally a question of individual technique, just like scene framing: you need to figure out the effect your group needs.<br/><br/>If your group typically needs some explicit coordination to get a scenario together, a public Key Element list might be in order: just tell the players at the beginning of the session what you've planned to focus on in this session, roughly. List the Elements you've prepared on a sheet and paraphrase it for them, then leave the sheet lying around so they can pick stuff from there and run directly towards it. "I'm thinking that this session concerns the events of the winter court, I've prepared a series of zany visitors who'll tax the chief's patience to the limit." or some such agenda declaration will surely be useful for a certain type of group. For others that'd be too much cooperation and too little surprise, so you might also choose to keep the list secret and only reveal Elements as they're triggered by play. Difficult to say what might be best - you'll probably have your own ideas.<br/><br/>Key Elements are a very interesting type of rule overall, it's positioned very similarly to Gift Dice or equipment rules as an idea: totally optional, but allowing of useful technique in specific applications. For example, I have a great Secret in TSoY (perhaps it is in WoN?) that allows a player to establish Key Elements into the SG's list, which is just sexy. Actually, I've also used a sort of prophetic Secret that explicitly allows the player to read the Key Elements list for added screwyness.<br/><br/>Ah, your question, specifically: don't think of Key Elements as something that <i>has</i> to be encountered during play; scene framing and dramatic coordination should happen exactly the same whether you have prepared material or not. The only difference is that when you need to introduce something new you can do it from a prepared list instead of improvising. Therefore the answer to the issue of how the player will know to go to where all of your Key Elements are is the same as it always was: you frame the character there instead of engaging in in-fiction negotiation about it. If your prepped material is focused on the jungles of Qek, then you begin by framing a scene that sets the character into interaction with that prep instead of requiring the player to guess which compass direction he should take. If it's starting to seem that you need to be dragonian in your scene framing to get to use your material, then that's a sign of over-planning: you need to cut back on the prep and concentrate more on creating flexible material that is not tied to fictional time, place and positioning to get used successfully.<br/><br/>I think that I write in the SS booklet shortly about how the Key Elements list can be utilized to keep a sort of running chronicle of the campaign as it develops: whenever an Element is activated from your list, cross it over. Then between sessions you add more stuff at the end of the list instead of writing a new one for the next session. This way any prep you made earlier but that remained unused carries over, and you can sort of see from the list with a glance how much new material you'll need for the next session. You don't try to get the players to go through your Key Elements like they're a checklist to complete; rather, you patiently preserve the stuff  you didn't have an opportunity to use and spring it at them when you get the chance. Key Elements do not grow old unless activated.<br/><br/>Finally: check out the "First City" chapter in WoN if you haven't, I conceived it as a Key Element scenario when rewriting it for the book. Don't remember if I mentioned that in there, but technically every place, character and Bang outlined in there is usable as a Key Element as per the definition. You might want to use a higher Advance price if you go wild with the prep like that, though - I wouldn't have more than at most a dozen prepped Elements to a session normally; that sort of thoroughly planned scenario can give quite impressive amounts of xp, I imagine.<br/><br/>Also: do write about your experiences with WoN somewhere; I've gotten very little feedback about the book, and am hungry for informed opinions. Interestingly this is the third Maldor campaign that I've heard of, and that's out of the three new campaigns I've heard to use this book in total - so far Maldor has gobbled up 100% of the groups using the book for some reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268428/#Comment_268428" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T21:28:38+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  9:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2010 9:28PM by Ludanto.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly, I haven't played WoN, but the book really helped me "get" the Solar System, so thank you for that.<br/><br/>If I ran a game, I bet it'd be in Maldor, though, especially with new players, because it seems the most "medieval fantasy" flavored.

The Prophecy Secret and the prior thread you mentioned (where the Secret lets the player introduce Key Elements), and the breadth of Elements in the First City prep, are what informed this post, and my concern about potential disingenuousness.  As I said, Key Elements match my usual prep style, in that I list characters and situations (places usually only as part of situations or for set-piece fight games) already, at least as reminders.  So, this is not a big step, but I feel the way I introduce the concept to my players and the way I actually employ it could be almost as beneficial to momentum, pacing, and framing, as Keys themselves.  They explicitly give traction to engaging with my points of interest, as a fellow player with different responsibilities but a similar desire for participation in the emergent narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I am nitpicking this optional rule, that otherwise probably doesn't warrant much reflection or scrutiny.  I am enthused to see how it plays out, but I want to have a more formal approach going in.  It is difficult for me to decide between offering the list openly (a much smaller and more focused one than I currently have) or using a large list and simply 'pinging' it as we go (framing toward Elements as appropriate).<br/>\n<br/>\nI settled on Maldor because of our familiarity with the adventuring paradigm; if I expected to continue play past Sunday with this group I would suggest Ammeni - the themes would be pretty personal for all of us.  Since there's a decent chance of ending up incoherently drunk, fighting, reminiscing, wisecracking, lamenting woman troubles and the like, I'm going to stick with something unchallenging and immediately engaging.  I'll post an AP on the Arkenstone forum on the Forge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268490/#Comment_268490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T06:10:45+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  6:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've run a lot of Solar System games in different settings (although oddly, never in Near) and we've never found a good use for Key scenes/elements.  They always felt false- the GM is basically saying "hey guys, here's a cool thing I want you to see! If you come look, I'll pay you in XP!" the players aren't really invested so there's probably no real tension in the scene, but hey, free XPs. <br/><br/>In my experience it always worked better to use PC Keys as the hooks to pull them into situations you ( the GM) are interested in.  That way you have investment in the scene from both sides of the table and the scene becomes a lot more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268498/#Comment_268498" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T06:42:40+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  6:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, now that I'm thinking about it again, I can see one good way to use them.  The cool thing about PC Keys is that they are essentially a list of things the player is interested in, written down and handed to the GM.  When I run the game, I always have that list of keys in front of me to drive my decisions.  <br/><br/>If you flip that around and have the GM write down a list of things he wants to see in the game, he can put that on the table for the players like a menu of tasty possibilities.  It's very much like achievements in video games, where there is a specific, interesting challenge that players can work toward:<br/><br/>"Be the first to breach a sealed tomb in the Cursed Canyon: 2xp"<br/>"Bring a rare Silver Orchid to the Alchemist: 2xp"<br/>"Survive running the Thieves Guild Gauntlet: 5xp"<br/>"Gain an Audience with the Queen of Yor: 5xp" <br/><br/>The GM is explicitly drawing a path or paths that interest him, leaving it to the players to choose them or not.  This would compliment the process of writing the Keys, Secrets, and Abilities for the campaign, helping to set the tone for the game.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's how Key Scenes were always meant to be done, but it never came across to me that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268502/#Comment_268502" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T06:58:50+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  6:58AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>I've done something similar, although my Key Elements were less specific. Players could choose how to interact with them. For instance, I had:<br/><br/>"The wedding of Cyrile Varga. 3 XPs"<br/>"A Tchegaran sets foot in the church for the first time. 2 XPs"<br/><br/>So, players could get those XPs by being involved in any way: by marrying the Varga themselves, or showing up at the wedding and interfering with it, or whatever.<br/><br/>I also had a couple more vague elements, just for fun:<br/><br/>"A challenge of honour. 2 XPs"<br/><br/>Again, you could get that because you challenged someone to a duel, or because you pissed someone off enough for them to throw down with you, or even if you orchestrated a similar situation between two NPCs. These were all just things to play with. This sort of thing is good for focus in a short-term game, I think, and probably not as necessary in a campaign.<br/><br/>It worked pretty well, although, as expected, many of the elements were totally ignored. That's the nice thing about Solar System/TSoY: if you don't like a certain avenue of XP gain, you can always choose another one by buying a certain Key and chasing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268514/#Comment_268514" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T07:41:21+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  7:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that makes sense.  Were your Key Elements one-time things, or could they be hit repeatedly (by the same PC or different PCs)?   That is, could everyone get in on the Wedding and get XPs?  Might there be multiple challenges of honour through the course of the game?<br/><br/>My gut-feeling is that Key Elements should be ablative- once someone hits them, they're gone.  As (I think) Eero said above, the GM just adds more things to the list as they go along, providing new objectives to reach for.  This would create a more competitive game, I'd imagine, where the PCs struggle to be first to grab the brass ring.  Maybe not if there's enough variety in the list to keep them all busy.<br/><br/><small>(on review, much of what I'm saying was already said earlier by Eero- I just wasn't able to parse his essay from my phone <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269283/#Comment_269283" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T09:15:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  9:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2010 9:17AM by d.anderson.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29717.msg276276#msg276276" rel="nofollow">I posted an AP</a> on Eero's forum on the Forge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
