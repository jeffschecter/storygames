The actual probability of producing identical decks is 52-factorial; aka, 52!; aka 52 Shriek.  (Approximately, 8.0658175*10^67.)<br/><br/>However, the most popular card games don't really make much use of the uniqueness of each deck: the effect is diluted by the combining of cards into hands, the division of games into rounds, etc.  But most profoundly, it is diluted by our brains' abilities to see patterns.  So often we see the pair, the full house, and even the royal flush is hardly uncommon.  So might creating a game that maximizes the significance of a deck's uniqueness be a method of anti-story-gaming?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410976/#Comment_410976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T12:17:34+00:00" title="April  1, 2013 12:17PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not particularly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410984/#Comment_410984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T13:20:35+00:00" title="April  1, 2013  1:20PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2013 2:14PM by Dreamer.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "So might creating a game that maximizes the significance of a deck's uniqueness be a method of anti-story-gaming?"<br/><br/>I think that would depend on how such a deck is being used for story-gaming, and how the maximizing of uniqueness is being implemented.

If you want to use the whole information content of the deck at once, then you should use the whole deck at once. The number of permutations of 52 cards tells us exactly nothing about the similarities (under any particular similarity function) of those permutations. One way you could do it is make a machine that generates story-games that's programmed by the permutation number of a given shuffled deck. If all numbers are valid programs, and all programs produce the rules for a story game that are different to the results of any other program, then you can use All The Uniqueness. To make sure that there are no similarities, you should make sure that each permutation N maps to the Nth incompressible string such that no previous game could generate that game and then run it. Fortunately for you, <i>all you have to do</i> to check that a string is incompressible is run all the previous strings and make sure that they don't eventually print out your string. After 10^67ish infinities, you should be all done. Although if you used a non-turing-complete programming language for the story-game-making machine it might be possible!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
