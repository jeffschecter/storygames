Here's an excerpt I was just reading today:\n<blockquote><br/>My first Dungeon Master had us perform feats of endurance and strength to gauge where we fell in the 3-18 range, our Constitution was determined by holding our hand over an open flame. The more seconds you held it, the more points in Constitution you had, but inversely the less Wisdom points you had because you were, after all, burning your hand for a stupid game.</blockquote>\nHorrifying... and yet interesting, as well.<br/><br/>What are some of the most unorthodox methods you've seen or used to create characters for a game?

The first few sessions, I would just observe their behavior and intuit that this guy is a lethario and this one is a bad-ass and so on. That informed their stats.<br/><br/>Not really inspired, but I think this one is...<br/><br/>I also ran a game once, where the snacks they chose before and during game led to (balanced) bonuses to their D&amp;D character.

You can't see anything. The light starts to dim. You can make out a figure. Dims a little more. What do you see?"<br/><br/>I went around the room, filling up a portion of an index card each time, asking them more of what they saw. When the index cards were filled, I handed them to the players. What they saw was their characters, which the clicked on.<br/><br/>Then we played the scene. They were trapped in a maze where every surface was mirrored. No character sheet or stats -- in fact, they didn't know what game system we were using. We just winged it until I felt like they shared camaraderie.<br/><br/>Then I whiped out the Unknown Armies core book and they got excited. Then we made the characters almost normal-style, street level with a Soul skill that was undefined.<br/><br/>This was the first scene of the campaign, and a clue as to what they actually were -- archetypes in the Invisible Clergy kicked out by ascending Godwalkers. So they were literally being recreated in this room in the House of Renunciation. It was a few sessions before that understanding was dropped on them.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332803/#Comment_332803" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T14:29:27+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  2:29PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me of a con game of Over the Edge that Robin Laws ran.
