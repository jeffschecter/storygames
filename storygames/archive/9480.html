The Plastic Logic read shows 8.5x11 pdfs graphics and all. Cool I thought - an Ereader I might actually buy. In fact it sounds like a reader that could push printed trade paperbacks out of the market. Even though I do printing and bookbinding I was not saddened by this. Instead I see it as an opening for game books and boardgames to become art objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nPDF sales should be greatly advantaged by a good reader so that business model will continue and improve. I attended a panel at Marcon (a sci fi con in Columbus Ohio) and found people also not sad to see books go. I thought there would be more emotion against it from the "books are my friends" crowd but there wasn't. So I think the audience is ready for this. Which begs the question of what happens to paper books.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I never got another company to make my games I set up a workshop in my garage to do printing and book binding. The skills heavily overlap with board game making so now I make boardgames. I can make 100 games a month which way exceeds what I can sell right now. I don't think other people need to buy machines like I have. A simple art studio could do the trick. The point is after sheets come off the computer (which remains the printing press in my eyes) how they process and package it is where the art comes in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard part of any business model is how to sell after an item is made. Art can be sold on line just as easily as a pdf - the only difference is you have to make something and mail it. If you like getting your hands dirty this should not be a problem. If you're like me and can make 100 games a month then you have enough to sell to stores if you want. It will mean calling them and building up relationships but this is what artists do with galleries so it really is the art business. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that the art talent in this community could really make this approach work and would increase the prestige of game making because of the skill and workmanship put into it. Think of the beautiful handbound books that could be made with rich bindings!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm planning on trying out this model and will let you all know how it turns out. I'd love to hear your comments and questions now. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\nHamsterpress@gmail.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210080/#Comment_210080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T15:08:37+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  3:08PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris, I saw your games at Gen Con last year and loved them.<br/><br/>I have a datapoint that may be of interest. Last year my wife began to sew custom hand-made dolls inspired by the curriculum at my daughter's school. This is a waldorf school, where there's a strong emphasis on hand-made items. Recently, she opened a shop on <a href="http://etsy.com" rel="nofollow">Etsy.com</a>. Etsy is a marketplace specificlly for hand-made objects: nothing mass-produced. It's gotten strong adoption from a number of disparate communities, including the Waldorf community and the Maker community. She's basically been selling dolls as rapidly as she can make them.<br/><br/>Maybe what home-made games need is its own online channel. This might be Etsy or some other service. Browsing around Etsy I find people's hand-painted Warhammer 40k miniatures, felt "Mario Brothers" dioramas, goth ktisch, as well as lot of more traditional hand crafts. There's a huge potential there. I've been kicking around the idea of selling hand-crafted maps and models there myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210122/#Comment_210122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T06:06:45+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  6:06AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Tony. I've heard of Etsy - just recently. My wife is considering making dolls as well. She is a puppeteer and the skill to make them overlaps well. I don't know if that is where to sell games but it would be nice if there was a place. Something to consider setting up but I lack the computer skills to do that myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nDrop by the booth this year and you will see that the bozes have a full color shiny wrap and that the boards inside the game are improved. I got a tabloid printer so the maps go together more precisely. I've switched the character cards to character sheets so everyone keeps track of the events of the game as it's played. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big game this year is a hybrid Boardgame Matrix Game called "Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese". A basic run in and steal scenario with the option to pee on things (they are hamsters after all!)<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210129/#Comment_210129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T06:37:01+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  6:37AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never really saw this as a Ereader thing so much as a Torrent/the internet thing. <br/><br/>When I can get the content of an RPG book for 0 dollars, the real value in the RPG books I do buy is the book itself.

I think Etsy is 100% the right place for hand-crafted board games. What it needs is a bit of a grassroots effort to get people to realize that 1) there is such a thing as a hand-crafted board game (and why they are cool) and 2) an understanding that Etsy is where you find them. To this end, you'd probably want to get some Etsy sellers together and form an Etsy group. Then figure out a common tag to share so people know how to find crafted games (and game paraphenalia) in general. Etsy has a bunch of useful tools to help you build a store, a community, and a following. I'm a fan.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Calling them art, is great but if that leads to some kind of speculative market inflating prices, that's pretty shitty.

The "maker/craftsman" community has a very similar ethic to the story game community. They're about making cool stuff and sharing it with other people. There are always people who tray to charge a fortune for a piece of crap, but it's the exception. If you look at Chris' stuff, you'll see he doesn't fall into any of the categories you're worried about. <br/><br/>To me, handcrafted game stuff boils down to this: if you buy a fantasy flight game, you're paying for a certain amount of tone-setting fancy bling coolness to enhance your gaming experience. If you go buy one of Chris' games, you're also getting something really beautiful to enhance your gaming experience, except it's not factory-produced. It has it's own brand of cool-ness to offer. Thats my personal take on the whole handcrafted thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210224/#Comment_210224" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T13:25:13+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  1:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Calling them art, is great but if that leads to some kind of speculative market inflating prices, that's pretty shitty.</blockquote>Heh, it might not lead to speculation, but <a href="http://www.jewelroyale.com/welcome.html" rel="nofollow">sometimes materials and craftsmanship commands millions of pounds.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://jergames.blogspot.com/2007/03/top-ten-most-expensive-board-games-in.html" rel="nofollow">[Would You Like To Know More?]</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210227/#Comment_210227" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T13:42:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  1:42PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd never want to go off in a snobby direction with art.

I'd do WordPress with a modified template to "fake" a normal web site design (rather than a blog) and then plug in the Shopping Cart as a Page. It's surprisingly easy (see <a href="http://davidartman.com" rel="nofollow">my site</a>, though I don't have Shopping stuff installed onit--check it for how it "fakes" being a normal site, with Posts as linked articles, not automatically date-sorted journal entries).<br/><br/>But all that said... yeah, it would be easier to make a simple site with a small portfolio and some contact info, then point folks to your Etsy store (and group, if you're feeling cross-promotional).
