                    I've written a game recently entitled Dramatikos, and I was wondering if there is more that I could think about or consider to make the game more complete.  I'm pretty sure that I hit all the major things, but without playtesting, it's hard for me to find exactly which things would impact play the most if I overlook them.  I'm hesitant to simply post huge chunks of text on a thread if no one is interested, so if someone is interested in helping me out in this regard, I'll be glad to post what I have.                </div>

                            Hi Green, <br/><br/>You might get some replies here, but have you considered posting to the indie game design forum at the Forge?  I've found it very useful, particularly when I posed specific questions. "Could I improve this?" isn't likely to gather a lot of responses, but "should I use live animals or dead animals for my haruspice-based resolution mechanic?" will get some thoughtful replies.  <br/><br/>You might also consider putting your game up as a .pdf somewhere, so that people could review it and then comment in the thread.<br/><br/>Also, in my experience, playtesting is the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> 100% best way to improve your game!<br/><br/>--Jason                        </div>

                            I've attempted the Forge several times, with limited success.  I'm leaning towards not relying on the Forge to get anything substantial in feedback or playtesting done.<br/>

I do believe I have a PDF of my game, but I'm not yet up to fiddling around with a website as of yet.  I might restructure what I have already to present things in a more efficient way.                        </div>

                            Hey dude, I sent an email re: posting and getting feedback at the Forge when you applied (especially in light of another recent move to make those forums more structured towards feedback for new games and designers).  Did you receive that? I can try resending if you didn't.<br/><br/>We'd love to help out with little ideas ("Hey, how does this fit into the game?") or talking about how to get the game kicked into production through new means and the like... And heck, unlike The Forge I'm fine with talking about how cool dice are, or rules with no game around them and the like.  But when it comes to actually building a game into production, that place is second to none, and I'd rather not replicate their function here.<br/><br/>And I gotta bak up Jason: Playtest, Playtest, Playtest.  Playtesting is what seperates a functional game from a shitty game. Play with your friends in your town.  Come up with a rules PDF and solicit playtesting on the indie-netgaming Yahoo group. But man, Jason's working on three games concurrently, and there's about 4 of us in our town that are working on other games: We all started off with great ideas and shitty execution, all which was revealed and fixed because of playtesting.<br/><br/>People can read your rules, but you'll never know if the game is doing what it's supposed to until you playtest.<br/><br/>Thanks and good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I did receive your email after I checked this site.<br/>
<br/>
Playtesting is a bit difficult given my work schedule and the local gaming community.  Right now I'm interested in having independent groups playtest my game.  I can make a PDF of the game (it's all text anyway), but I don't think it's ready for a website just yet.<br/>
<br/>
The basics of the game can be found on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18264" rel="nofollow">thread I started on the Forge</a>.                        </div>

                            EDIT: Oops, cross-posted. Yeah, put your game into PDF and hit up Connections (at the Forge) or better yet Indie Netgaming and offer to run it:<br>

Ahh, hey, I did a bit of digging at the Forge but I found your post on Dramatikos. No big, and I totally agree with you that in the current format of Indie Game Design a lot of games will slip through the cracks especially if they make it to Page Two without feedback, but there are always tricks to get more folks interested in discussing your game there (until the upcoming rearrangement makes it easier to get feedback without tricks):<br>
<br/>
1) Put the name of the game in the thread title.  It works, I dunno why. Starting with the game title seems to get more interest.<br/>
<br/>
2) If you haven't heard any feedback for two days, follow up on your own thread not with a "Hey, Anybody out there???" (which some do, to the chagrin of others), but rather look at your post again, see if you can pull out a more specific question, and ask that specific question in a post to your own thread:<br/>
"Hey all, I was thinking a little more, and what i really need help with is this part right here: XYZ.  Any ideas?"<br/>
<br/>
3) If someone posts to your thread, always consider their feedback and give a reply.  if their reply is nothing more than a "Hey, cool!", then thank them and go to step 2, above, asking a more specific question.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it looks like you only posted one "grand thread" on your game recently to Design, which IMO is absolutely no reason to give up on the place as a whole (I didn't get a lot of feedback for some of my stuff early on until I, as Jason said above, started to ask more specific questions about elements of the game).  Not chiding or anyhting, but I do think you need to maybe use some of the three ideas above to help yourself out (maybe I'll break off into another thread on "Tricks to get Feedback at the Forge"). <br/>
<br/>
I certainly agree that the current environment is a little (just a little) stagnant, where games can totally fall through the cracks easily if they hit that second or third page without solid feedback (BTW, Loved your thread on "Introducing Your Game": I really think that's going to help on future individual game postings when people ask questions about their own games).  But let's also do what we can to use a few tools and tricks to get more feedback as well.<br/>
<br/>
And heck, since you posted here, this is a community of peers!  While I'd rather not discuss the general design here (unless you have some specific questions), I'll totally help by dropping the link to your thread at the Forge here, and ask others reading this to check out your post and provide feedback if we can.  I'm going to be busy for a few hours but I'll hit your thread later tonight or tomorrow:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18264.0<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and again: Playtest, playtest, playtest.  Since there's only two players needed, I highly recommend recruiting friends to play, or looking at indie-netgaming to see if anyone would be interesed in playing over Skype (inernet phone chat) or text-based. That's the only way you're going to know if your game works in the end.<br/>
<br/>
So, Green: Dont give up!  Gambare! <br/>
And Others: Check out Green's thread at The Forge.  Any feedback you could offer?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

My thread on Dramatikos was not the first one I posted for one of my games.  It started out as Kathanaksaya, which got a lot more feedback initially since the Design forum wasn't as popular, but that sort of dwindled after a while.  I attempted the indie netgaming group, but everything I attempted fell through, and I just got frustrated and left.  I had a group I could inflict my ideas upon, but they have since drifted apart.  Real life and all that.  I could get back into gaming, but my work schedule and my current social circles do not really permit it.  In addition, one of my big projects is working on getting my play produced, which takes a lot of time when I'm the only one putting effort into it.<br/>
<br/>
However, playtesting Dramatikos may be easier since you could conceivably play it via post or e-mail. I do not provide rules specifically for that, but given the mechanics, it certainly is doable.  One possibility I have thought about is making the game as accessible as possible across a wide variety of media: tabletop, chat, play-by-post, and LARP.  I'll probably start a thread on the Forge about that, though.                        </div>

                            I went to check out your thread on the Forge.  But I can't post a reply to it.  Mostly because I can't figure out what the game is about.  I mean, it looks like something is going on there, but I can't figure out what.  See now, I can't force myself to dig deep into someone else's game and try to figure out what's going on and how to help them.  So, if you can't catch my interest with your post and fire my imagination, then I can't really help you, right?<br/><br/>Hell, before your post here I never even would have looked at your Forge thread.  "Introductory scenarios in rpg books" sounds like a topic about the pros and cons of having into scenarios in an RPG book, as opposed to a request for help in your design.  Topics like that make my eyes glaze over and my heart rate drop 'till I'm in a coma.<br/><br/>It's been my experience while at the Forge that, to catch an eye and grab some inspiration, you've got to sell your idea.  And you've got a very small amount of space to do that in.  You've got to pull people in with your title, tell them all about your game and what will make it cool in four sentances or less, and then keep everyone focused with clear and concise paragraphs about your game.  Then you've got to finish it up with some direct questions.  <i>Hard</i> questions.  <i>Controversial</i> questions.  Shit that's going to make people think and take sides.<br/><br/>So, what I'm saying is that, yeah... I've been in that boat too.  I've posted plenty of shit at the Forge that I got zilch of a response too.  But I came to realize that it was because I was boring people.  <br/><br/>My point is; <i>I</i> want to help you.  <i>They</i> want to help you.  There's a huge community out here that wants to help you.  But dude, you've really got to earn it.  You've got to entertain and inspire us to get into your game.  You've got to make your PDF available as soon as you're asking questions about if anyone wants to help you with it.  And please, pretty please, keep those intro PDFs for your game as slim as possible.  There's nothing quite as dissapointing to me as getting psyched up to check out someone's new design and finding out that they're asking me to read a 60 page PDF with a wonky font.                        </div>

I'm not trying to be snarky or obtuse, but why didn't you ask for clarification on the other thread instead of coming here to tell me how to entertain you with my posts on the Forge?  You coming over here and telling me that the title of my threads bore you and then proceeding to give a lot of advice on how to hook people into my game does little but slowly convince me that the Forge is not the place for me to present my game designs because I'm ever so stupid to post something interesting and challenging enough for the members.                        </div>
