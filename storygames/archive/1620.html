<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1600" rel="nofollow">Shreyas' discussion on character sheets</a> got me thinking.<br/><br/>As I note in that thread, I've had some success running a game where essentially all the materials were displayed on a 'Science Fair' board I picked up a local office supplies store.  This original use was one-part organic and one-part necessity, as I wanted something that was easy to pack up and pull out but that was also very visual.<br/><br/>As I said, the thread got me thinking.  What if the design was very intentional around using the stand-up board?  What sort of game/play would result from this?  What limits to information storage would result?  <br/><br/>More abstractly, I find myself wanting to have the game story/setting/themes tie back to the concept of the Presentation Poster.  Where is the engaging story to be found?  Perhaps the illicit after-hours activities of individuals who go to strange towns for Academic or Professional Conferences and Conventions?  A cadre of professional travelling presenters who fight crime?!?  Maybe the politics underlying the world-design discussions of a pantheon of deities....<br/><br/><br/><br/>In case you are unfamiliar with what I am referring to, I share some suggestions around preparing Poster Sessions: <br/>"A poster presentation should be self-explanatory, allowing different viewers to proceed on their own while the author is free to supplement and discuss particular points raised in inquiry. "<br/>"Specifically, the area available for each poster presentation is 8 ft wide x 4 ft high (2.44 x 1.22 m)."<br/>"Title: Prepare a banner for the top of your poster indicating the title, authors, and affiliations. Lettering in the label should be at least 1 in. (2.54 cm) high."<br/>"Illustrations: Figures should be designed to be viewed from a distance, and should use clear, visible graphics. Although each figure should illustrate no more than one or two major points, figures need not be simple....Each figure or table should have a heading of one or two lines in large type stating the â€œtake-homeâ€ message."<br/><br/>Academic Posters are not dissimilar to the idea of dealer's room booths, though typically more constrained in space and formatting.  I won't compare quality, as this varies wildly in both populations.                </div>
