I'm a person with a brain and I don't need derivative work that is just a rehash of something I already know. RPG books are not like fiction. They are concrete and only become new and exciting to those who haven't read it. After that, it's already learnt knowledge and I feel it is a waste of currency to expend on panhandlers of other people's work.<br/><br/>Just from my own experience, there are too many different methods to resolve something for a game that stealing a well established system is merely fan service at best and shouldn't be encouraged, but it is praised because it's a new release, easy to remember the things you already know, and hip. It's the biggest reason I call a large portion of players Hipsters because any critical group wouldn't tolerate what these people have bought to the table for game designs.<br/><br/>To summarize my tirade with an actual game, I would say something along the lines of what Rudy from the podcast is making for next month's Misery Tourism game gives me all kinds of excited to actually play it. The punishments and methods of solving problems all relate to the theme of the game and aren't simple rehashes of popular work already out there. It used to be another roll some dice and get X or better until the crew had a discussion on how to make everything fit without the need of the dice. If the dice were included, it would have been just like every other game out there: A cookie cutter game of previous work with new window dressing.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough that current designers haven't really tried to make real innovative work so far. It's a big insult I know, but what has been done is exactly like what William stated in ep 47. The majority of games made today lazily appropriate DnD and other popular titles from that time period. It's a generalization before anyone harps on me for that and I'm talking about the majority of published work.<br/><br/>Speaking of design, I'm actually working on a game that revolves around doing something unique. It actually encourages you to go outside and notice the cool things around you. And the best part? Other people can see where your adventures took you. How is that for a fresh twist on RPGs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388017/#Comment_388017" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T05:36:37+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  5:36AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was that a meta-pitch, Alex?<br/><br/>I think, given all the talk about how to promote your game, "the pitch" would be a good topic for ep. 55 (or 56 or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388020/#Comment_388020" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T05:50:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  5:50AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2012 5:52AM by zircher.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crossposted from the blog site...<br/><br/><b>Zircher wrote:</b>\n<blockquote>Wow.

In it's current state, it is a necessary evil to reward players to play out their negative traits, work for their secret agenda, and to help determine who 'wins'. To some poeple, the points are what makes it a game. Any suggestions on mechanics that could replace it?<br/><br/>One of the things that I do encourage (and you can even see it in several of the play sets) are optional or house rules. Just to throw it out there, would a scoreless option with a shared epilogue be desireable?

In it, the butler made four different attempts to explain who caused the murders and whatever version he explained was correct. This helped the expense because it was similar to those soap dramas where they ask cliff hanger questions to entice the audience. Since your game is model after Shakespeare, it would be choice to use a drama or theater style mechanic that frankly is not being used in the games I've played.<br/><br/>The other players would vote on which ending they preferred to play out as the last player got to explain the ending of the game. But yeah, enough rambling from me, we can talk further on a forum or something since they'll probably be a lot of back and forth in order to help you.</blockquote>\nHmmm, interesting.  But, let's say you had five players, that could make for a very long epilogue phase when everything should be wrapping up.

Unfortunately most people don't. There's a reason for that and it's the effort that it takes to learn an entirely new system.<br/><br/>I was stumped for a long time on why there is so much resistance to change in the RPG industry. Then a fellow named BubbaBrown gave me the key. Mechanics are like an NES or an Xbox or a Wii. The setting and story are like the game you put into that game system. The players get used to the interface that the game system provides. As long as there's new content for that system, they'll keep playing because it's comfortable.<br/><br/>To your point, not everyone is limited this way. You like the experience of a new interface. It's intriguing to you. Where as most people don't want something new, they want their comfy old interface.<br/><br/>If their interface stops putting out new games, some will just keep playing the old ones. An interesting thing happens in the RPG community though. A "new" game can imitate the interface of the old system. Players flock to it because it has a low mental cost of entry.<br/><br/>So yes, some of us like a new interface but like a majority of console gamers the larger majority of role players like the buttons to stay where they've always been on their controller. They're just mental buttons.<br/><br/>No that doesn't solve the problem but like you I was frustrated by it until I came to understand the nature of it. I guess that's helped me to get some peace on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388029/#Comment_388029" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T06:45:17+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  6:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Crossposted from the blog site...<br/><br/><b>Zircher wrote:</b><br/>Hmmm, interesting.

It demands somebody either know the other person and what they would prefer, or luck in being pleased with their answer. I do think you are on to something with the shared ending, but I think you should relate it to gameplay more. Right now it's a little more divorced with what you were doing in the game, but it's familiar to your 'Yes, and/but' rule. Maybe you do that thing where the first player tells his piece, then each player goes around adding off the previous portion of the ending. This will tie more into your 'yes, and/but' mechanic throughout the ending and still allow people to potentially not screw over their fellow players.<br/><br/>As a side thing, maybe consider having the players use one of the previous tiles that player used as inspiration for telling another player's ending. It's a suggestion to toy with because I have no immediate answer that could possible satisfy, but it's a start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388037/#Comment_388037" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T07:07:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>To your point, not everyone is limited this way.

I'll try to explain more of what I mean as I ramble.<br/><br/>I think I understand the bulk of your analogy. The only problem I find with it is that it implies the lack of change in the interface is the problem, not the method of interacting with the interface. For example, if you use a controller or a keyboard and mouse for every game and the interface is the exact same thing, then yes, it changes the focus of improvement from ease of use with the interface to the variety or style of actions you can make. This is more in line with my problem. <br/><br/>That analogy however, doesn't take into account things like a lightgun or an Eyetoy/Kinect. With things like that, the interface can still be the same (like button 1 is for attacking, button 2 is to block), but the method in which you interact with it changes and encourages different ways to interact with it. That in turn, encourages new methods that can be superior to what everyone is used to and allow them to find the way they really want to play. <br/><br/>That right there is the most important part about what I'm getting at. If everything is the same, you are taking a gamble that that experience is the only experience worth taking, even if you are frustrated with that experience. You shouldn't be trying to find the perfect method with change. You should be trying to find the perfect method for that audience. At least, that's my take on it at first glance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388042/#Comment_388042" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T07:17:23+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2012 7:23AM by whduryea.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This probably didn't come across in the podcast, but I actually really like the idea of winning the epilogue. Rudy has <a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/the-needs-of-the-few/" rel="nofollow">a game that does this</a>, and I think it creates a real incentive to play with more passion, strategy and engagement. It makes the entire experience more complex and fun than it would be otherwise.<br/><br/>I also think that tying the traits and score to the numbers on the dominoes is an elegant, accessible way to integrate it into the game. Having earning a higher score linked to playing your character flaws is a great idea.<br/><br/>My problem with the system as it is stands is that the voting mechanic is too loose and vulnerable to social pressure. It's too easy for points to just be rubber stamped. This is complicated by the fact that the dominoes are drawn randomly. As a result, the game can come down to drawing the right dominoes and hoping no one decides to try to veto your points.<br/><br/>If this were my game, I might have the dominoes spread around, face up, in the center of the table, and have each player pick a domino at the beginning of their scene. Once a domino is picked, they would be guaranteed those points, but also be obligated to play the traits on the domino. Maybe I would empower the audience to be able to refuse to let a player end a scene until they feel like they're really played both of their two traits out completely in the scene. This would eliminate the stalling and social awkwardness that comes with voting. It would also make domino selection a strategic choice instead of a lucky fluke.<br/><br/>Using this hypothetical system, I would probably score single blanks as 0 and double blanks as if they were double 6s, since single blanks give you an advantage in play while double blanks carry a heavy cost.<br/><br/>The only potential problem I see with this is that it might lead to front-loaded drama as players scrabble to gobble up the more valuable dominoes (which are also the ones most likely to generate dramatic moments) before their friends can get them. This could be averted with some kind of rationing system--perhaps certain high value dominoes don't "unlock" until later scenes--but that might be kind of an inelegant solution.<br/><br/>As far as a scoreless variant with a shared epilogue is concerned, I think Alex had some great ideas. I don't have any of my own right now, and I'm at work, so perhaps I'll weigh in more later.<br/><br/>Edit: Actually, the game already has a built-in solution to players binging on high value dominoes. Doing this should make it very hard to accomplish your secret agenda and get your 10 bonus points.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388053/#Comment_388053" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T08:25:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  8:25AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That right there is the most important part about what I'm getting at.

The upside to all this is that, on occasion you get something like the Wii, Kinect or Amber diceless that has a different interface and people jump on it because it is so different they can see the advantages or at least become interested in the different play experience. So it can work and in the meantime take heart that there are people that love to experience new interfaces.
