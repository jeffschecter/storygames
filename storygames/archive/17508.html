We used a slightly stripped down version of the system and ignored the magic rules as they were too boringly systematic. For the most part players didn't have access to real magic anyway. When they did, I ignored the rituals as written and as the GM created a spell ritual on the fly borrowing from various of traditions.<br/><br/>The madness rules and the rich fiction are what make the game. By the end of one of my sessions one of the war veterans had fallen seriously down the madness well with physical manifestation of jagged shards of stained glass coming out of his back like wings. That was also the one where they passed through the illusion while running from a lictor and and met Faust who looked like and old man fetus and was imprisoned in a jar\u2026 <i>yeah you can get seriously dark and crazy with the game.</i><br/><br/>If I were to GM it again, I'd use an AW-hack. I gleaned the Swedish one that is in beta (thanks Google Translate!), but I don't care for how they are approaching it. They are mapping the character archetypes directly from the Kult book and to be frank those are the most boring aspects of the game. Really I think it would make more interesting to borrow more heavily from AW: Chopper = Gangbanger; Gunlugger = Professional (hired killer) or Tough Cop; Hardholder = Mob Boss; Hocus = Cult Leader; Operator = Fixer; Savvyhead = Mechanic; Skinner = Femme Fatale. This would be a different game in that the characters would be more badasses than how Kult is originally designed to play. However, I like that aspect as then you can involve some serious world corruption with the lictors and other darker influences.<br/><br/>That said, Kult can work great on a more interpersonal level too. Might make for a great really really dark Fiasco playset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397700/#Comment_397700" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T04:29:15+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  4:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The Swedish authors where interviewed about the game in the Swedish gaming magazine Fenix earlier this year.

This could be to bring a close connected NPC out of a personal pain purgatory they created for themselves (with the help of a Nepharite), or destroy a place that serves as a doorway to Inferno.<br/><br/>If you are running more of a campaign, then that's when you slowly reveal the mobster like bureaucracy of the criminals, serial killers, black magicians, beasts of the borderlands, lictors, cultists, and other horrors that are controlling and feeding off of humanity. It doesn't matter if the players just want to settle down and avoid the horrors, they can't forget nor can they ever hide as they have captured the attention of someone or something. I mean sure the characters would like to just get back to their day jobs and forget what they witnessed, but now they know that the "Happyland Day Care" chain is actually a front for child torturing soul stealing servants of the Dark Angels.<br/><br/>This is why I mentioned it could be run as either: a dark Fiasco, where the players are trying save someone from personal pain purgatory but all end up dying in the end anyway. Or as a AW-hack as the world is basically an apocalypse where most of humanity doesn't realize it. Also, the fiction provides so much fodder for throwing constant Threats and Fronts at the players.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397773/#Comment_397773" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T14:54:05+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  2:54PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 2:54PM by Colinaut.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Correction on my earlier post.

Monsterhearts creates different kind of shit because it has different moves and slightly different principles.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that if I start running Kult with an AW hack, I'm running someone else's interpretation of what Kult is. AW's mechanics have a lot of stuff in them, and all that creates the game's fiction. I'm guessing that something closer to freeform would give us more interpretative liberties, but I'd like the central thematic elements of the game (madness, at least; maybe the imbalance of power between the PCs and the creatures) to be presented by effective mechanics.<br/><br/>That said, I could make an unholy homebrew <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398073/#Comment_398073" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T09:01:13+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  9:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now that I'm not sick and can think more clearly, I'll state a couple of things differently.<br/><br/>I want a system can adapt to the fiction quickly.
