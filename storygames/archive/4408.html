Over the course of all these highly successful runs of the game, I've hit upon several rule drifts I like, as well as some strategies that are useful at cons (and a few of which are useful in general). I think these are pretty helpful and fun and I wanted to share them with the community, and also welcome feedback on them.<br/><br/>First I'll start with the rules drifts. If I get some of the actual-printed PTA rules wrong here, please feel free to correct me.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The first big drift I do is to have only one conflict per scene. I have found that having only one person conflicting with the Producer per scene, and having people help or hinder with that with fan mail or Edges and Connections, focuses the events of the scene very intensely and helps a lot with making each conflict intrinsically about that character's Issue.<br/><br/>The other drift is that according to the rules, stakes are supposed to be binary: "What do you want? Do you get it or not?" I've found that that can be stifling, so instead I do a more traditional stakes setting thing where I say what I want and you say what you want and we negotiate until both outcomes are interesting.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Next up, strategery.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99447/#Comment_99447" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T07:10:31+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  7:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EVERYONE PREMISES: In the pitch session, I ask that every player come up with at least one Premise for a show. This is especially helpful in a con game where people may not be familiar with story games or the level of narrative power they have in them. It signals to people early on that they will be participating constantly. Also it prevents the socially dominant from wholly taking over. Finally, I often find that in coming up with several premises we can meld some together and have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>BRAINSTORM THE CAST: In addition to brainstorming Premise, Mood, Conventions, etc., I ask that people not start out with a plan for what character they want to play. Instead we brainstorm a cast list too. What kinds of characters would the producers of this show want to see? I usually try to come up with 1.5 to 2 times the number of concepts as there are players at the table. We can then say things like, "This guy <i>has</i> to be in this show." We can also often combine concepts just like we combine premises.<br/><br/>DON'T PLAY BEFORE YOU PLAY: It's important to cut the pitch short, especially in the conventions and tone section. I've seen a lot of people have a strong urge to play before you play at this stage and that can be death to story momentum later.<br/><br/>PUSH FAN MAIL: This is especially important in a con game, though not exclusively so. One of the worst problems you can get into with PTA is to have a big pile of unawarded fan mail sitting in the center of the table. It literally slows the game down and usually makes it pretty painful. Sometimes in a break I'll ask people, "Why are we not awarding fan mail? Are you not having fun? What would it take for you to do so?" I often jokingly say things like, "Wow that was awesome. If I had fan mail to give I totally would give it to that." Sometimes I've even stepped in and given some out to stimulate things though I am loathe to do this and usually disclaimer heavily so people don't think that it's a Producer prerogative.<br/><br/>Con-specific stuff<br/><br/>RUN THE 1ST SHOW NOT THE PILOT: While you're "supposed" to always start with the pilot, I think that's not a good idea for a con game. People need to see the effects of screen presence, and even if they know what it does already, if everyone's played the game before, having SP in play makes the game much more fun and interesting.<br/><br/>FIND A COMMON SHOW: When explaining the rules to people who are new to the game it's important to find a show that everyone has in common. I had always assumed that Star Trek would be easy but these days that's not so. Anyway, once you have a show it's easy to explain the rules (personal set, issue, etc.) in terms of that show.<br/><br/>RUN A MEANINGLESS CONFLICT: Again when you are explaining the rules it's important to show people how they work, but it's also important not to spend story-energy. Pick something lame that you will never care about--a foot race, an arm wrestling match. It's mega-important that it's not cool at all, so that you don't wish you'd done it in play.<br/><br/>PREFERENCES WARNING: This is a huge one. I'll just copy what I wrote in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20445" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>  on The Forge.<br/><br/>"If you don't like TV and can't say to yourself, 'If TV were done a certain way it could be really cool,' then this probably isn't the game for you.  If you get nervous when you get put into the GM's chair, asked to narrate and take control of the world, you will not enjoy this game and, as a result, neither will anyone else.  Please, try another game, I know that GAMENAMECENSORED is looking for players right now and it would be really cool for them to have some more."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99476/#Comment_99476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T09:11:26+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  9:11AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/>RUN THE 1ST SHOW NOT THE PILOT: While you're "supposed" to always start with the pilot, I think that's not a good idea for a con game.

There were two reasons for that. <br/><br/>New players often saw their Screen Presence as a measure of how much involvement the <i>player</i> (as opposed to the character) was allowed during an episode. It would often lead to them not putting in as many suggestions as the players whose characters had a higher Screen Presence. <br/><br/>Additionally, players with some experience in other RPGs are often wary of character imbalance in the group, which is how different SP come across at first. Since this rarely leads to enjoyable experiences in regular RPGs, they prefer to avoid such an imbalance at a con game. Starting all characters off with the same SP allows this element of the game to move to the background and let's players focus on many of the other things that PTA does differently. <br/><br/>I'd agree though, that if your group has played a bunch of story games before this might not be much of a problem. A pilot episode might seem a little boring then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99479/#Comment_99479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T09:25:52+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  9:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Georgios,<br/><br/>I think it's got to do with how you present it. I make it clear that low screen presence means your character is not a major character in the episode, and that you don't have as much power to affect the story, but that you can still rack up fan mail and strategically arrange things to have a big effect on the story.<br/><br/>In my pitch at the start of the game I also make a very strong break between character and player, pointing out that suggestions for what other characters would do makes total sense because, remember, we're the writers as well as the actors on this one. No one owns Buffy and everyone can make suggestions on what she should be doing to make the show as good as it can be.<br/><br/>On the balance issue, after explaining what the different SPs mean, I ask, "Does anyone feel like they'd like that role? They'd like to be a background character in this episode?" I've never had anyone say no. In fact I usually have to adjudicate it to prevent to many people being 1s.<br/><br/>I make it clear that those with lower SPs have a job to do: to make this episode be about this other character, to play in their scenes toward that character's issues. Again, I've never had a problem with that aspect. <br/><br/>Finally, on the story-game-familiar aspect, as I said I've run this probably 20 times at cons. At the start of the game I ask if people have played PTA or even other story/indie/narrativist games before. About half of the people so surveyed have not, and they have not had a problem with the things you list as concerns.<br/><br/>Oh an addendum method: I usually plot out the entire season's SPs even for a con game. Knowing where their characters are going has been great grist for characterization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99482/#Comment_99482" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T09:42:58+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  9:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2007 9:43AM by PaulCzege.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We mis-read the game text and it became our favorite house rule: <i>you can't get fanmail if it's not your scene</i>.

It sort of happened half-way through, but at first there was always a strong "my guy first"-attitude to the game. After a while they really got into it, throwing ideas back and forth and occasionally letting their characters hand the spotlight to somebody else... but in general the players I've met were a little more egocentric. Which seems to be the default in non-story-games I've played as well.<br><br>Even suggesting things for another player to do with their character is something that people have only gotten used to toward the end of the game. This all led to me choosing pilot episodes for con games. In addition to that trying to visualize a character's story arc sometimes led to pre-planning their story, which put a huge creative block on the game. <i>"I can't let X happen, because this isn't my SP-3 episode yet. But my SP-3 episode is all I'm thinking about." </i><br/><br/>I've had people eagerly picking the SP-1 episode, after I'd explained screen presence much like you wrote. This usually lead to me as the Producer having to carry the bulk of the game, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. An even distribution of SP transported this idea of everybody having to chip in to make the story work much better than outright saying it did. For whatever reason.<br/><br/>I think it's just a case of different experiences. Your players obviously had no trouble getting into the co-operative story mindset, while the players I've met were often starting from a more or less competetive "showing off my guy"-story approach. <br/><br/>Chris,<br/><br/>the people I've run PTA for were often struggling with requesting scenes (where they would essentially frame them to the point of already resolving conflicts, before anybody else got the chance to join in), having to provide narration (which might resolve the entire scene or be completely inconsequential), recognizing conflicts (often 'roleplay'-ing straight through them), injecting issues into the scenes (often forgetting about them, until we got to the cards where they would try to retcon the scene to make the issue fit in somehow), etc. I've since chosen to address screen presence, but to default to playing the pilot episode unless the players object. <br/><br/>PTA can have a steep learning curve, if your players have a very specific idea of how roleplaying games are played and how story features in them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99519/#Comment_99519" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T12:00:54+00:00" title="September 27, 2007 12:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/>The other drift is that according to the rules, stakes are supposed to be binary: "What do you want?

In my opinion the only drift here is negotiating the loss condition.  My reading of PtA has always been:<br/><br/>The player states what he wants his character achieve (Stakes).  Play Cards.  If the character fails then high card gets to determine WHY he fails up to and including totally hosing the character with an unexpected reversal of fortune.  In other words the consequences of failure are totally unknown and wide, wide open until its decided who gets to narrate the consequences of failure that person then has carte blanche to decide the consequences of failure.<br/><br/>So for example:<br/><br/>If NPC Andy has a gun trained on NPC Bob and PC Alice says, "I want to get the gun from Andy."  We have NO IDEA what will happen if she fails to get the gun from Andy.  It's entirely legit for the whoever gets the high card to say, "It's clear Andy is going to shoot Bob, Alice leaps in and yanks the gun at the last second but her grip just isn't tight enough.  Andy pulls the trigger and shoots Alice!"  It's also legit for the high card holder to say, "Before Alice can move Andy pulls the trigger and shoots Bob!"  or even "Alice springs into action just a second too late and Andy shoots Bob.  In the struggle a second shot is fired and Alice is shot!"<br/><br/>There are similar spin tactics for what happens when a PC wins a conflict.

Such that when player states a goal for their character we no NOTHING about HOW the character achieves the goal until the player with the high card tells us.  Let me reword my original example slightly.<br/><br/>NPC Andy has a gun pointed at NPC Bob.  PC Alice states her goal as, "I want to stop Andy from shooting Bob."  At this point we play cards having no idea if or how Alice will stop Bob from getting shot.  Let's say the cards come out and are in favor of Alice.  So at this point we know that Alice will stop Andy from shooting Bob.  But!  Let's say someone other than Alice's player gets the high card.  It would still be perfectly legit for that player to narrate how Alice carefully talks Andy down or how Alice dives forward and rips the gun out of Andy's hand or even that Alice whips out her own gun and shoots Andy before he can shoot Bob.<br/><br/>I think playing in this manner would really get across to the players that while they are their character's caretaker they are not their character's OWNER.  Once this is across they will probably be more comfortable aggressively setting up scenes, especially scenes which do not feature their own character.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99574/#Comment_99574" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T14:03:57+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  2:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>Do you often find players choose characters they themselves didn't suggest for the 'cast pool'?</blockquote>\nYeah, rather often.

Is this something that comes naturally from play, like naturally falling into the 3 or 4 Act structure?  Does the game end when the Producer runs out of budget (which I've seen mentioned a couple of times in threads)? Or just whenever you want (the book mentions something to the effect of "Okay, it's getting late, let's wrap this up!")  Or any and all of the above?<br/><br/>Related to that, have you found that there's a minimum amount of time, where if the game ends too quickly it's just not satisfying (for all, or even just some players, perhaps related to spotlight)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99617/#Comment_99617" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T17:49:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  5:49PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding is that the episode ends when the Producer runs out of budget.
