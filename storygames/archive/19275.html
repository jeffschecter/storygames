I have been hoping to write up actual plays of my experiences with it, but so far life has been intervening. However, I finally got around to scanning in the physical artefacts the game creates, and have posted them on my blog <a href="http://weaving-stories.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/intrepid-shattered-light.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The maps are so much fun!<br/><br/>The important text from that post:\n<blockquote>In the second game we created a sphere of fragmented planetoids, some larger enough to host cities, others no bigger than a house, floating in a mysterious void. Populating these planets was a culture we decided to label "pre-revolutionary France" and yet they had mysterious stone ships that could cross the void that were decidedly Incan in theme. Throw into that the threat of invading space elves powered by fear &amp; blood magic, a killer who murders her victims in the past, and Captain Carrot and Nobby Nobbs lookalikes and we had a whale of a time.</blockquote>\nWhile I am failing to write up properly, feel free to ask me questions about our game, and maybe I will ramble a bit in reply - that seems easier.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have Intrepid APs to share?<br/><br/>Our group is still pretty new to this kind of story gaming, so we over-specified things in our setup phase, and then ended not using a lot of it and coming up with more things that were relevant to the stories we actually told on the fly - a common mistake I'm sure. It would have been better to be really strict with ourselves and just try and sketch the barest of suggestive sentences in the setup phase and figure the rest out as we played.<br/><br/>People enjoyed the way in which they could create characters, but those characters were not too closely identified with them - played by different people at different times. Our group decided that this resulted in more interestingly fleshed out characters, rather than falling into ruts of character development.<br/><br/>Everyone loved the map, and we managed to keep arguments about how the gravity works in that system to a minimum, which considering we were 50% scientists wasn't bad going.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429363/#Comment_429363" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T07:09:50+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  7:09AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal favourite moment of the session: Christophe (time monk expelled from the monastery for predicting the death of the King), accompanied by Michael (aka Captain Carrot) have pursued the trail of the Yesterday Killer by looking further back in time whilst dashing across the industrial city of Bimingham. Finally he gets to the scene and he sees the murderer (through the veil of time, you understand). I'm directing, so I ask Christophe's player, "Christophe sees someone he loves committing the murder. Who does he see?" We resolve the answer through a Crossroads moment, and it turns out that the Yesterday Killer is Elena, that player's character in another thread of the story, who is at that moment battling her way out of the Space Elves' Incan pyramid. The revelation made my spine tingle - kudos to a game that can get me to feel that way about a story we are current telling!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429369/#Comment_429369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T08:11:57+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  8:11AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great writeup!

We knew that somehow from there we wanted her to become the Yesterday Killer (we were assuming that the two stories had happened offset in time) in order to wrap things up in a satisfying manner. So we had two crossroads that explained why she had done so. I can't quite remember them, but I think in one the King sent her off to deliberately kill random people in order to increase fear, as Elena had absorbed the Bloodmongerer's power and could now use Elven fear-based magic. So by killing citizens she could gain power to protect the throne from further elf invasion - pretty dark, I'm not sure we went for that in the end. But also pretty plausible and interesting!<br/><br/>I made a recording of the session, so I should be able to remind myself... but it's not very clear and takes ages to wade through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429427/#Comment_429427" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T02:36:58+00:00" title="March 13, 2014  2:36AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one aspect of play we found a bit tricky: One of the first steps you do is draw an outline of your map - this defines the scope of the story/setting. So you might draw a small deserted island, the moon, or North America. Because we were playing a setting that takes place in space, we weren't quite sure what to do. It wasn't space as defined by some particular feature - for example, an asteroid field, or solar system. Rather, we wanted to follow the classic space trope of a cluster of well-explored locations in the middle, and increasingly unknown space all around.<br/><br/>The way we solved this was we just left the map blank except three concentric dashed circles. We labelled them as "1 week", "2 weeks" and "months" indicating roughly how long it took to travel between locations within those areas, without having to define what the scale was - we didn't know whether people travelled around the void by FTL ships, or old steam tugs at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429458/#Comment_429458" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-14T03:03:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2014  3:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of games in playtesting were like that.. a central area and then the space around it.
