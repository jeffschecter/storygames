I have fun, but I'm still worried that it's a bug in the game, rather than a feature. At the end, the players have worn down my resources so they walk in and blast the target. No climax. Just a resolution. What has helped this feeling is developing some detachment. I'm not the target, I'm the proctor reviewing how he was killed.<br/><br/>So how do I communicate this concept in the rules? How do I keep someone else running the game from getting invested in the character of the target and wanting more for him/from him? This may just be the disease of too many heavily plotted games (ala WoD) but I think I need to expect that any GMs who come to the game, and aren't already on this forum, may have trouble with the end of the job being a period ending a sentence. <br/><br/>Any good suggestions about how I should reinforce a GM's objectivity in the rules?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121670/#Comment_121670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T08:40:33+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  8:40AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn!

I ask because you seem to present a highly passive end game... could the WHOLE game become GM-passive (no GM)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
