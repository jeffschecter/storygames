I like this, so I've included the score below. <br/><br/>I must admit, I'm feeling slightly guilty about that score, but it's honest: I think Beast Hunters is an fun game, with a ruleset that could do with more polishing, and a confusingly organised text.

The setting is unusual, but rich: think tribal rituals, spirits, stalking mythical beasts through jungles.<br/><br/>Note that it's a two player game: although there's a multiplayer option, this game is, essentially, about challenging another player head-to-head. But, just because you can't play it with your game group, don't dismiss it. This is a game to play after work, in the pub or at lunchtime.<br/><br/>The layout, by Fred Hicks, is clear and easy on the eye; and the artwork, by Joanna Barnum, captures the tone beautifully. I'm judging this from the PDF file.<br/><br/><b>The text</b><br/><br/>The book begins with a quick pass through the history and geography of the setting. It's interesting and inspiring, although perhaps overfond of adjectives and peculiar names: "The mages and Karakaan soldiers conquered most of the Berengad, with the exception of the tribes of Chel\xe2\u20ac\u2122qhur".<br/><br/>One paragraph stands out. It explains that the tribe's women "choose the men they want to breed with" and that some tribes "treat their man badly". It's jarring and it's not referred to again: indeed, it's later explained that Beast Hunter men and women are treated equally. So what's the intention? Perhaps it's intended to make the game less macho, more welcoming to women: but it reads as though someone's hijacked the text for political purposes.<br/><br/>The text is long and, although literately written, it's badly organised.<br/><br/>For example, the conflict system is explained before character creation. This is confusing: the text mentions "traits" and "resources" before explaining what they are.<br/><br/>Most strikingly, important rules are hard to find: for example, when does the Hunter fight the Beast? It turns out the Beast appears after the Challenger has spent all his points: but this rule is buried.<br/><br/>The text is overwritten: after all, it's 154 pages for a two-player game. It needs editing. Some sentences are unnecessary ("In order to play this game as a Hunter, you need to create a character") ; an entire section on Stakes seems superfluous; the author often uses a paragraph where a sentence would have sufficed. All this makes reading the text a chore and, during play, makes finding rules difficult.<br/><br/>It's not unreadable. But it's a complex ruleset, which isn't well explained. More summaries, examples and checklists would help. To understand it, I needed to read it three times, while taking notes.<br/><br/><b>An overview of the rules</b><br/><br/>One player is the Hunter, who goes on the adventure; the other is the GM-like Challenger. The Challenger has a stack of Adversity Points to spend on monsters, obstacles and so on. When they're spent, the Hunter battles the Beast itself.<br/><br/>The game begins and ends with the "salute": a special handshake. This, explains the text, is an indication of respect.<br/><br/>On the journey, the Hunter battles physical, mental and social obstacles. The rules for combating these are complex. Firstly, there's a three-stage negotiation process to define the conflict. Then players take turns, rolling dice to gain advantage, then converting that advantage into a strike.<br/><br/>During the conflict, many optional rules can enter play: the Challenger can offer the Hunter an advantage, instead of rolling dice for advantage; both players can affect damage using weapons and armour; and the Challenger is encouraged to "give" (forfeit the conflict) if the Hunter has particularly good ideas.<br/><br/><b>Beast Hunters in play</b><br/><br/>I played Beast Hunters with Alex, after work, in a pub. The atmosphere suited the game: relaxed, low-key, with drinks. Alex was the Hunter, I was the Challenger.<br/><br/>We began with character creation. It was fun: traits included "My father's axe", "Healing broth", "The Hatehawks' blood is in my veins" (we'd decide what Hatehawks were later).<br/><br/>Character creation wasn't all easy. The rules insist you classify Traits as Physical, Mental and Social and as Offensive or Defensive. But what's a Mental Defensive Trait? We settled for Unrelenting Focus, but that could, as easily, have been offensive. And many of Alex's traits (such as "I sing to drive away fear") could have been either Social or Mental.<br/><br/>And then the salute. We shook hands. It felt weird. Indeed, we didn't understand the salute: should we "salute out" of the game if, for example, Alex went to buy a drink?<br/><br/>The setting, we quickly realised, was fantastic to play in: all slaughter and spears and butchering and tribal spirits. Exciting and inspiring.<br/><br/>Alex's first challenge was social: his tribe threw a farewell feast, before his hunt, and threw insults at him. We went through the pre-conflict negotiation process, although it felt perfunctory: we knew what the conflict was about and I had no questions to ask Alex about it.<br/><br/>And we rolled dice, back and forth. It was fun: he threw insults and gained an advantage; I threw some back. However, it got repetitive and I "gave" to end the conflict.<br/><br/>Then Alex's hunter started on the hunt. I set a mental challenge: on a mountaintop, with the Hatehawks gathering, filling his mind with fear. Again, we did the pre-conflict negotiating, but it felt perfunctory. Again, we rolled dice: and, again, it was fun at first. However, this mental conflict seemed difficult: there's only so many ways to describe fear building. Eventually, again, it got repetitive and I gave.<br/><br/>And so it carried on: conflict after conflict. Many of these were fun: a social conflict against travelling priests; a bloody battle with a family in a villa. Superb, inspiring stuff.<br/><br/>As the game progressed, it seemed strange that social, mental and physical conflicts were treated as equal. To us, the physical conflicts seemed most fun: after all, it's a game about hunting. Why were social and mental conflicts given equal prominence? Mental conflicts were especially difficult: descriptions of hard stares and concentration got boring quickly.<br/><br/>Also, many conflicts seemed repetitive and prolonged. In the combat rules, you build up an advantage, then convert it to a strike. But there's only so many ways you can describe building up an advantage: in physical combats, we kept repeating "I move to the higher ground" and "I try to corner you".<br/><br/>By the end, the pre-conflict negotiation was a chore: if we played again, we'd ignore this rule.<br/><br/>We enjoyed the game, which lasted two and a half hours. We nearly forgot to salute (shake hands) at the end: it didn't seem important.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>There's a great game in Beast Hunters, with a superb, inspiring setting. As yet, it doesn't feel fully realised: the ruleset feels in need of playtesting and streamlining. Some rules seem unnecessary (the salute, the pre-conflict negotiation); some need tweaking (the equal emphasis on physical, mental and social conflicts).<br/><br/>The text is overwritten and ill-organised, making it difficult to understand a complex system.<br/><br/>However, there are many positives: it's a good-looking book; the tribal aspect is evocative and inspiring; you won't have trouble thinking up adventures; you'll easily discard the rules you don't need; and it's one of the few two-player games on the market. If that attracts you, Beast Hunters is worth a try.<br/><br/><i>Overall score: 2 / 5</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81103/#Comment_81103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T10:32:29+00:00" title="July 13, 2007 10:32AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Graham.

I proposed a possibly faster Strike mechanic on RPGnet (under the screenname "The Eye"), but I haven't had a chance to really test it because I'm in the middle of a Dust Devils game. By the way, you did realize that you don't have to go to the full-on dice-rolling conflict resolution every time, right? Reading through your play report, it seems like you may have it every time, but I wasn't sure...<br/><br/>Also, I'm interested by the idea of dropping conflict negotiation completely. I mean, I dig the way it works and it suits my play-style nicely, but I'd be intrigued to see actual play of a game without it. What potential issues might there be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81266/#Comment_81266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-14T17:10:22+00:00" title="July 14, 2007  5:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2007 5:11PM by johnzo.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like dyjoots, I've thought about a couple of mods to speed up BH play.

This makes devastatingly good narration even more devastating.<br/>* roll 2d20 for maneuvers instead of 2d10, while using the published +4/+8/+12 AP award guidelines.  This makes the "should I roll?" decision much harder, even when the AP award is up around 10, and it turns BH into much more of a gambler's game.

Alas, I'll try to keep my ramblings as short as I can. They are meant in the spirit of providing you with a better experience with the game. Some of it might sound argumentative or defensive, but I hope you can trust me that that's just because of the medium we're using. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>First, I think I know why the reverse-sexist part of the setting is chafing you. If you want to talk about that, Knife Fight would probably be a better place to do it. For now, I'll just point out that I see it as an opportunity to explore those themes in the game. It makes for good drama as well as food for thought.<br/><br/>Your points on organization are well-taken. I do think flow charts and the likes could help a lot. Thanks to Brand, we've got those on our site now, but in the future I'd include something similar. Your reaction to the text as being overwritten is interesting; all other feedback we've gotten on it so far is that it's a breeze to read. Also, in the future, I'd probably include something like chapter summaries (Burning Wheel does this extremely well).<br/><br/>As to most of your other points, these parts here are the basis for my reaction:\n<blockquote>The atmosphere suited the game: relaxed, low-key, with drinks. ... And we rolled dice, back and forth. ... in physical combats, we kept repeating "I move to the higher ground" and "I try to corner you".</blockquote>\nYou're treating the game as a pickup beer-and-pretzels game, you're not investing much in either challenge creation or stepping up as the Hunter, and then you're surprised that conflicts drag out and get repetitive. To me, that's not a surprise at all; it's absolutely to be expected.<br/><br/>There's a lot in the book about how to make the challenges interesting, from both sides. This requires investment from the players. It's a Step On Up game, not a leisurely rolling dice game. If you're expecting to hang back and just roll dice instead of providing engaging content on both sides, then yeah, the game won't flow well at all. I wish we had recorded the Go Play NW sessions, so I could show you the kind of actions people can come up with when they really focus on it, and when they are provided with well-created challenges that, as the text advises, gives a lot of opportunities for creative solutions and actions.<br/><br/>This ties in with your dislike of both the salute and the Negotiation. The salute establishes a focused environment. Yes, you're supposed to salute out if someone goes and gets another beer; that's because you're breaking your concentration on the game. And the Negotiation helps to establish, through the questions back and forth, a lot of details that then can be used during Conflict Resolution. It also serves as a measuring stick: is this a bland challenge? Is it too easy? Not enough to do? Then just move on and don't force yourself through Conflict Resolution.<br/><br/>As for speeding up the game, I've found that you can do that easily with the tools provided. The Hunter can pick higher Limits and focus on raising offensive traits and resources. The Challenger can buy mostly offensive adversity and maybe raise advantage point offers.<br/><br/>As another note, I'm a bit puzzled that while you don't want to give equal screen time to mental and social challenges, you don't just have way fewer of those? That doesn't seem like a design flaw to me, but rather a matter of choosing your own style.<br/><br/>Now, all this said, most of the responsibility here rests on my shoulders. I need to make sure that everything I've said in this post is included in the game. I felt that I'd done that, and it seems like it works for a lot of people, but obviously I need to do better. So thanks again, and I'll make sure to be more clear, concise, and at the same time thoroughly explanatory about the design choices in the future <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81593/#Comment_81593" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T04:42:30+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  4:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 4:43AM by Graham.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I'm having trouble responding, too, and I think it'd be easier in a pub.<br/><br/>To go back a little: I spent a weekend reading through Beast Hunters, making sure I got the rules right, and then Alex and I played it. We played it with gusto, too, wanting to have fun. So every criticism is something that genuinely frustrated me in having fun with Beast Hunters.<br/><br/>So don't dismiss it easily. It really worries me that you've dismissed most of the criticism: don't do that. It's stuff that stopped the game working for us. And bear in mind that I'm criticising with an aim to improving it.<br/><br/>Now, sure, perhaps sometimes I've misdiagnosed the problem. Perhaps I'm wrong about the negotiation phase: perhaps it's great, I didn't understand it properly. That might suggest it's a problem with the text, not the game.<br/><br/>Still, 75% of those criticisms will be a symptom that Something Is Wrong: either in the game or the way it's explained.<br/><br/>I'll go through some specific points and, as I'm sure you'll understand, I'm not arguing: I just want to give a bit more background. \n<blockquote>Your reaction to the text as being overwritten is interesting; all other feedback we've gotten on it so far is that it's a breeze to read. </blockquote>\nTo be honest, I'm rather surprised. It's literate, but it's certainly not a breeze to read. The original setting section is pretty readable, but the rules themselves are pretty stodgy.\n<blockquote>You're treating the game as a pickup beer-and-pretzels game, you're not investing much in either challenge creation or stepping up as the Hunter, and then you're surprised that conflicts drag out and get repetitive.</blockquote>\nWe weren't treating it that way, honestly! Even though we played in a pub, we played hard. Those were meaty challenges.<br/><br/>We felt the system got in the way of being challenging: by making us do things like gain advantage, when we wanted to go for the throat.\n<blockquote>And the Negotiation helps to establish, through the questions back and forth, a lot of details that then can be used during Conflict Resolution. It also serves as a measuring stick: is this a bland challenge? Is it too easy? Not enough to do? Then just move on and don't force yourself through Conflict Resolution.</blockquote>\nI didn't understand that! I didn't understand what the purpose of negotiation was at all. Perhaps I missed something in the rules, but I think it needs better explaining,\n<blockquote>As for speeding up the game, I've found that you can do that easily with the tools provided. The Hunter can pick higher Limits and focus on raising offensive traits and resources. The Challenger can buy mostly offensive adversity and maybe raise advantage point offers.</blockquote>\nJust to clarify, our problem was with the length of conflicts, not the length of the game. It's possible those things would have made them quicker, though.\n<blockquote>As another note, I'm a bit puzzled that while you don't want to give equal screen time to mental and social challenges, you don't just have way fewer of those? </blockquote>\nWell, we wanted to try them, because they were part of the game. <br/><br/>Also, the system seems to push you towards treating them equally: if I'd mainly invested my Adversity Points in Physical Challenges, Alex's Physical damage boxes would have filled up quickly. So we spread the challenges. <br/><br/>Mmm. I do hope some of that's helpful. I've got a lot of time for Beast Hunters: there's some superb things going on there.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82480/#Comment_82480" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T10:25:56+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 10:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2007 10:26AM by Graham.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13149.phtml" rel="nofollow">this review is now posted at RPG.NET</a>. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82486/#Comment_82486" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T11:00:40+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 11:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been meaning to reply, sorry for the delay.<br/><br/>First, here's a <b>big oops</b> on my end.

I mean specific things like dyjoots' Strike hack or actually leaving out all Negotiation.</blockquote>\nI think, as the game went on, we worked out how to game the system more: for example, do lots of low-powered strikes, instead of saving up advantage for big strikes. It seemed to end conflicts quicker and make narration more interesting (more Strikes). So we'd do that again.<br/><br/>I'd be aware that Mental conflicts could drag, so be ready to give more quickly. That feels slightly unsatisfactory - a workaround rather than a fix - but, still, I think it'd make things better.<br/><br/>On the Negotiation, I'm not sure. My first reaction would be to leave them out. But, also, I'd like to make them work properly. I'm not sure how to do that, but I'd read a few Actual Play reports and see what suggested itself. \n<blockquote>How much of that is something you think can be helped by clarifying the text or fiddling with the mechanics?</blockquote>\nI think there's definitely room for more explanation. I guess there's an implicit suggestion, in all of those points above, that more explanation would help. <br/><br/>Especially with the negotiation: I genuinely don't understand how to use it to full effect. Examples would help: I haven't got the text to hand, but, as I remember, there wasn't a three-stage conflict negotiation in the final example? Have I got that right?<br/><br/>As for mechanics fiddling: it's hard to tell. It does feel, to me, as though there's some room for tweaking.<br/><br/>My first thought, after playing, was that Social and Mental conflicts could be combined into a single category. , then, it'd de-emphasise Mental conflicts as their own thing and emphasise Physical ones. But, also, it'd give you another place to go in a Mental conflict. If some guy's trying to instill fear into your mind, it's natural to yell at him. <br/><br/>I don't know. It feels like there's some room for rules tweaking but, of course, it's impossible to tell instantly what would work.\n<blockquote>Would you mind letting me know, if you're playing it again, how things went differently that time and why?</blockquote>\nSure!\n<blockquote>I do really appreciate your time and energy with this. Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </blockquote>\nNot at all. As you can imagine, I'm spending time and energy because there's so obviously something good, at the heart of Beast Hunters.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
