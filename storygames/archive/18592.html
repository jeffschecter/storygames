I found reading other people's actual play accounts really helpful for generating ideas to use, so I figured I'd post my own.<br/><br/>Some basics:<br/><br/>We played as a one-shot over about 3.5 hours.<br/>We had all five characters represented; my wife played Lady Blackbird, and friends played the rest.<br/>We had 4 refreshment scenes, mixing flashbacks on the Owl, questions posed by the narrator, and questions posed by an NPCs grilling them.<br/>A couple PCs only had one advance (they weren't taking xp as much as they should've), but the rest had 2 or 3.<br/>There were several opportunities to buy off keys (and I pointed them out), but nobody opted to!<br/><br/>How things went down:<br/><br/>In the Hand of Sorrow's brig, Kale picked the lock, Natasha pretended to faint, and Naomi knocked out the guard. They tried to backtrack their way to the docking bay, and learned an important thing about the GMing style I intended to adopt for this one-shot: If they stopped to bicker out of character about what to do next, bad guys would descend on them right that instant. And so they did! Cyrus got to shoot a guy with the gun stolen off the first knocked-out guard, Natasha got to call in lightning from outside the ship <i>through</i> the steam pipes that marines were using for cover, Naomi ripped the arm off a clockwork battlesuit, and Snargle threw the suit's lightning canister at a group of guards. They managed to escape with minor injuries, and Kale sabotaged the Hand of Sorrow on the way out so that it couldn't follow them. They outran a couple short-range fighters sent after them from the Hand of Sorrow, and made their way to a nearby Imperial Fueling Station. They suckered the poor Dudley Do-Right lookalike guard there (who was really just glad to finally have visitors at his wee little asteroid, and who was smitten with the Lady who offered him whiskey-laced tea), and fled without paying at the pump. <br/><br/>Of course, they were there long enough to be identified, so there were multiple teams of bounty hunters waiting for them when they arrived at Nightport. They eluded the first team and found their way to the Black Hand tavern, where they met up with the notorious information broker Spluglord Squidmaster (who had pale skin, red eyes, and a beard that quivered on its own at times) and his guard Brenda (who turned out to be an old friend of Naomi's, and also able to bite through steel). After much banter with the Squidmaster, they agreed to trade a secret for a secret so they could get the path through the Remnants to Uriah Flint's secret base. (Lady Blackbird wanted to just spread the word that they were hauling expensive cheeses and sausages, hoping that the Pirate King's men would simply kidnap her if they got close enough to the Remnants, but the crew of the Owl were understandably dismayed by a plan in which they had to get raided by pirates to deliver their client to her destination.) As they haggled over the price of secrets, more bounty hunters came in, this time wearing void-powered suits that made the wearers look like black holes against the shadows behind them. Another scuffle of magic, pistols, and stone-hard knuckles later, and the Squidmaster learned Natasha's secret when she revealed her Stormblood heritage \u2013\xa0a fair secret to trade. <br/><br/>The way to the Pirate King's base required diving into the Lower Depths and using the blinking beacons of long-abandoned depth charges as landmarks. Kale rigged the void-battery from a fallen bounty hunter to create a "void shield" around the Owl, giving them some extra time to maneuver down there, and Snargle expertly avoided explosives and sleeping sky squids alike. When they finally arrived at their destination, the Pirate King tried to send them away for the Ladys' own good, and the narrator tried to rouse Cyrus's jealousy, but everyone seemed really intent on "doing the right thing," so the story ended with a filthy pirate wedding \u2013\xa0and Naomi joining the crew of the Owl, ready to help protect them from the minions of the jilted Count Carlowe. ("The End ..?")<br/><br/>Some reflections:<br/><br/>This group hasn't played a lot of RPGs that are this improvisational; they're much more used to pre-planned D&amp;D modules. The guy who played Snargle has done both Apocalypse World and a bunch of GMing, though, and the woman behind Naomi has proven herself over several different games to be a natural at this sort of thing, so those two in particular made up some great details as they went.<br/><br/>I was maybe a little too gentle on them as the GM, to the point where a few scenes really didn't feel as dangerous and exciting as they should. The players were very cautious with their rolls, using lots of dice from their pools and loaning dice to help each other, so very few failures were ever rolled. I think four refreshment scenes might have been too many for under four hours, but then again, some players said those scenes were their favorite part. (That's when we learned things like how Kale went to high school with the Squidmaster, who used to be a long-haired bully named Eric, and how Natasha welched on a bet with Uriah that he couldn't beat an ostrich in a race \u2026\xa0Uriah cheated, of course.) The ending in particular felt a little anticlimactic; that late in the story, rather than letting people roll to <i>avoid</i> dangerous situations, it's probably smarter to just put them in danger and make them figure out what to roll to get themselves out.<br/><br/>All in all, though, it was a grand time, and the players have expressed some interest in trying a Ghost Lines one shot in the future as well.

I ran Lady Blackbird for the first time yesterday as well.  Sadly we weren't able to finish, but folks said they had a good time and would want to meet again to finish it.  <br/><br/>Two of my players were mostly new to RPGs (although one had played D&amp;D years ago), while the other three are in my ongoing Apocalypse World campaign (although new to RPGs before that).  So it was great to hear my AW players explaining how to roleplay to the new folks ("Oh no, just say what you would say if you WERE that person.")<br/><br/>I loved reading about your Lady pulling lightning through the pipes; ours kept wanting to call lightning but felt she couldn't do it indoors.  Although eventually she used it to smite a former nemesis of Naomi's from the pits and Notavina, a rival sorceress from House Whitethorn.<br/><br/>I quite liked the roleplaying that came out of the replenishment scenes as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417985/#Comment_417985" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T16:53:35+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  4:53PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to you both! <br/><br/>And yeah, the refreshment scenes were great for pacing and some fun ideas.
