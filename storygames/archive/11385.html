A lot of attention gets given to helping players start into games, but I don't see as much for the first-time gamemaster. Many people here are probably fairly experienced, so I ask, what do you wish you had when you first started as a gamemaster? Are there things in other games that you've found especially useful? How about hazards to avoid?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253372/#Comment_253372" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T04:32:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  4:32AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I wish I had</i> not fallen for the whole "The GM is a storyteller" mumbo-jumbo.<br/><i>I found especially useful</i> games mechanics that support some sort of player input - like Burning Wheel's beliefs or whatever.

Incidentally, that's why I like reading APs for games I'm considering running.<br/><br/>When I first started GMing D&amp;D, I had it easy because I had experienced it quite some time as a player first. So I had an idea about what sort of things I could make into stories.<br/><br/>For a newbie GM, I'd appreciate if you give me some hinds about "this is the sort of things that you could turn into a story for this game". (So you don't end up with something like "dungeoncrawl with vampires as the 'heroes' "...unless you want to.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253401/#Comment_253401" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T07:39:51+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  7:39AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 7:40AM by xenomouse.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the first (and only) D&amp;D campaign I ran, I spent way too much writing out a detailed history for the game and planning out where I could direct the players.  I found what I had written interesting, but I never asked the players for input.  During the game, I encouraged secrecy, which led to an air of paranoia and broke down player communication.  I wasn't prepared for situations where the players wanted to do something that was cool for which there was no rule.  Ultimately that game ended after a couple of sessions.<br/><br/>At the most basic level, be familiar with the concept of "yes, and..."  GM's should be incredibly empathetic with the players - know what kind of fun they're interested in having.  Let them see what they want and then make them fight for it, and never put what they want completely out of reach.  Let them see that they are making progress, even when they stumble.  When they do stumble, make it meaningful to their character.  At a more granular level, make sure that it's clear how their characters are connected to the game you're playing.  That will make it easier for you to determine what they're invested in and how you can complicate their journey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253403/#Comment_253403" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T07:59:29+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  7:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 8:03AM by Wordman.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg Stolze released a <a href="http://gregstolze.com/HowtoRun.zip" rel="nofollow">13 page PDF</a> on this very topic.

This is a shared GM/Player responsibility.<br/><br/>Personally, also I wish I had learned earlier the points mentioned along lines fo the game does not belong to the GM, it\u2019s not \u201chis/her\u201d game, the players are not \u201chis/her players\u201d.  There is a division of authority around the table and with it responsibility, which varies between game systems.  However, everyone is responsible for making choices and adopting behaviours that support everyone else having fun.  A GM can be open to Player input but still keep all authority and thus responsibility, which burns them out.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253407/#Comment_253407" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T08:22:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  8:22AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may sound like hippie BS, but I've found it quite useful in my day job.<br/><br/>Something that may be helpful is if the group at the table thinks of themselves as a tribe - a small tribe of storytellers responsible for working together to create a shared mythology.  Players of the tribe have the responsibility to add details to a fairly small scope of the mythology (usually, the details immediately surrounding a specific major character).  The GM of the tribe has the responsibility to challenge the other members on the details they wish to add to the mythology as well as to add details to areas where the mythology needs them but where the players may not have the responsibility do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253591/#Comment_253591" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T18:30:21+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  6:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what you need:<br/><br/>A FUCKING MENTOR.<br/><br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>Practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253632/#Comment_253632" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T03:02:55+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  3:02AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever heard of writers ear?

Not surprising given the group I asked, and I'm in agreement. One of the flaws of traditional rpgs is they put too much responsibility for the narrative on the shoulders of the gm, overwhelming some new gms and closing the doors to great story ideas. Making this happen in a very traditionally-styled rpg is another trick altogether.<br><br>Now, if you're asking "why make it traditional?" the answer is that this is an experiment. I'm trying to understand the strengths of that form, and there are a few. It's a very different mindset, and adapting new techniques to that mindset has proven an enjoyable challenge, though I can't see myself going back to designing that way on a regular basis.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253912/#Comment_253912" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T01:06:44+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  1:06AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think it would help here if we were to break down what we mean by "traditional".
