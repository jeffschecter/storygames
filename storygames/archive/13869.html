While I've enjoyed it as-is, not all the scenarios seemed interesting to the folks I was with, and the idea of relying on the surprise of included scenarios seemed a bit weak. To address that, I came up with some changes to the rules that allow the game to be picked up more easily.</p>\n<p>If you aren't familiar with the basic rules, the primary idea is that everyone has a PC and takes turns saying a sentence involving their PC and up to one other one with no restrictions. A sentence can be challenged, which starts a bidding war where the winner can re-state the sentence, keeping the involved characters and a verb.</p>\n<p>So, house rules:</p>\n<p>Everyone picks a scenario together with some well-defined expectations. In the game I played we did X-Files-style trans-Atlantic flight. One way to create a scenario might be to have everyone pick a movie or two that everyone knows; this seems pretty close to the origin of some of the included scenarios.</p>\n<p>Everyone secretly makes a short list of things they expect or would like to see people do, like be the first to die, turn out to be an alien, jump out of the plane, be the last to reveal security clearance, whatever. These will be used to score at the end, though you can't score for your own card.</p>\n<p>Everyone describes the character of the person sitting to their left. Be nice.</p>\n<p>Play proceeds as normal, but without the dice-rolling mechanic.</p>\n<p>And that's it; you just score a point for everything you did on other people's cards.</p>\n<p>You can see a transcript of the game I played with this <a href="http://dampfkraft.com/cagematch" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If a sentence seems to repeat, that means it was challenged and revised (though not all such original sentences are in there).</p>\n<p>Besides just putting these out here, has anyone else done anything like this for the Narrative Cage Match?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314298/#Comment_314298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T16:29:42+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  4:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given the nature of the game I've been holding off on actually reading through it. I might run it again at a con, and once a few games have been used up, I think I'd look at doing some tweaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
