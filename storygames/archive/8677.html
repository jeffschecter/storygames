So, I can't claim too much experience with this game.  I've played a one-shot, read the book, and prepped a short campaign.  From that, I have some impressions that I think could lead to fun design discussion.  So, here goes.<br/><br/>The structures that support the GM instruct him to construct a horrible truth and a series of clues that propel the players toward discovery.  Reading this, and following the instructions, my impression was, "Okay, I've done this before."  As a longtime GM of Sim games, I've gotten quite good at running the Info Quest.  <br/><br/>My own Info Quest model goes like this: create major NPCs with ability to save or destroy the world (e.g. kings, generals), create secrets that will enable good to triumph over evil.  During play, provide the PCs with these secrets, as well as ways to get them where they'll do some good.  Throw conflicts and obstacles in the way of discovery and dissemination.  Ta-da!  Now go uncover the truth and save the world!  (If it's extended play, I also make sure to support any player attempts to leverage knowledge into social ascendance -- making powerful friends, forging deals, advancing personal projects, etc.)<br/><br/>So, I started doing the same thing, but using ToC's color.  The world destroyer is Hastur, the schemer is a Lloigor, the Lloigor's unwitting agents are a cult, the cult's recently indoctrinated a friend of the PCs.  That's the truth, and I'll show the players the truth piece by piece.<br/><br/>I stopped and asked myself, "Am I giving the players what they want?"  Well, sure, assuming that what they want is to find out the truth and save the world!  Is that what Trail of Cthulhu is about?  Well, the book says the game is about "doing the Lovecraft thing".  So, basically, I need to fill my game with Cthulhu color.  Okay, done: I picked Hastur and the Lloigor because I like their creepy vibes and am inspired to play them.<br/><br/>Does the book tell me <i>how</i> to "do the Lovecraft thing" as a GM?  Well, it told me about clues and discovery, and it gave me many, many pages of setting info with great art.  So, I'm inspired, I've got my Info Quest, I must be ready!<br/><br/>Still, "Am I giving the players what they want?"  Well, I'll announce to the group that this game is about uncovering the horrible truth, with Lovecraft color, and if they're into that, presumably they'll like the game.<br/><br/>What's not right with this picture?<br/><br/>Anyone?<br/><br/>Hint: long name of "Simulationism".<br/><br/>To be continued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191906/#Comment_191906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T12:32:14+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 12:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Backtracking:<br/><br/>While reading the book, I noticed a few interesting things buried in the Abilities section.  One of them was Cthulhu Mythos Lore.  Reading the description, I thought, "Ah, okay, this is a fun skill to take for the player who wants to start play with his character a little bit weird, out there, and in the know."<br/><br/>I also noticed Stability and Sanity, and then in a later section of the book I read the rules for how they go down.  Stability seemed kind of like hit points, in that you're in danger of taking <i>relevant</i> damage when it's low, but it refreshes.  And it's also kind of like special mental damage effects I've used before, in that it makes you act crazy!  Fun!  Some players might ignore that, but hopefully some will really run with it.<br/><br/>I've got the Stability loss rules for my Lloigor ready, so we'll see!<br/><br/>Sanity seemed kind of like a slower-evolving "character arc" kind of deal, where you slowly go nuts over extended play.  It's a different kind of nuts than with Stability loss too, more fundamentally out of touch with reality, instead of merely temporarily hysterical.  Sanity probably wouldn't come up at all in a short game.<br/><br/>And now, jumping ahead:<br/><br/>Having prepped my pitch, I contributed it to a Forge thread where Melinglor Joel was asking Ron Edwards about pitches.  The discussion was centered on generating buy-in (or exposing lack thereof) to what play would really be about, and Ron started talking "reward".  So I said, "Play ToC and discover the GM's cool, horrible truth!  Try to do something about it!  Mayve roleplay going nuts!"  These were teh rewards, as I saw them.<br/><br/>Ron disagreed.  He phrased ToC's reward system as, "The more you discover, the more you go mad, as your Mythos Lore score grinds down your Sanity score," also pointing out that players had the option to revel in sanity loss or resist it.  He was also claimed there was "no reward" in what I'd written.  While I was tempted to dismiss this, as Ron's previously admitted he hates the "GM breadcrumbs" style of reward, it did get me thinking about reward in Sim play:<br/><br/>The Right to Dream is the right to contribute strongly to the shared package that play explores.  To really epitomize it, stretch/test it, provide unique spins on it, etc., and have your contributions accepted and valued by the other players.<br/><br/>"Uncovering the GM's plot" says <i>nothing</i> about that.  Uncovering the GM's plot is just a vehicle, and if playing through that is going to be fun, the keys to fun lie elsewhere.<br/><br/>In my past Info Quest games, a lot of the fun came from overcoming conflicts.  I suck at building dungeons, but I'm good at leaving open-ended problems, with maybe possible solutions.  I facilitated players coming up with their own creative solutions, and they quite enjoyed this.  They also got into strengthening their characters' relationships with the setting, through all the connection-forging and info-gathering.  Hmm... doesn't sound that appropriate for a Trail of Cthulhu game, does it?<br/><br/>I went back to the ToC book and looked again at the Mythos Lore ability.  In the middle of the description, it says, "Sanity can never be higher than 10 minus Mythos Lore."<br/><br/>OH.  OKAY.<br/><br/>So now, my thought on "how to GM ToC" is a mandate that appears nowhere in the book, and it is this: <b>build in opportunities for Mythos Shocks and for gaining Mythos Lore</b>.  I still think learning the horrible truth will be fun, but those opportunities may well be where the <i>biggest</i> payoffs lie.<br/><br/>I consider ToC a flawed design, not because of any formal mechanics, but because "how to play" is delivered without sufficient focus on certain key elements.  Reading these rules is like reading the rules for Tic Tac Toe if "three marks of the same type in a row wins" was buried in tiny-print copyright info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191914/#Comment_191914" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T13:06:16+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  1:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Right on.

(I write here in my strident, outspoken voice, but don't think I'm arguing.)<br/><br/>You're <i>totally</i> right that ToC's mechanics don't focus on what play's about. ToC is an example of "Design What Doesn't Matter". The mechanics don't facilitate what the game's about. Instead, they get out of the way, so you can focus for yourself on what's the game's about.<br/><br/>This isn't fashionable, in indie-land. But it works for Cthulhu. Because, if you're playing Cthulhu, you <i>know</i> what you want out of the game. You'll do it at the table anyway and fudge any mechanics that get in your way.<br/><br/>ToC provides mechanics so that you needn't worry about whether you pick a lock or overhear a conversation. You always do; you always solve the mystery; and, meanwhile, you're free to roleplay in the way you love best. And the way you knew you would, anyway, when you sat down at the table.<br/><br/>I think you <i>sort of</i> prove this. You think that horror is about NPCs who can destroy the world, right? Cool. Trail of Cthulhu will do that. For me, Lovecraftian horror is nothing like that: it's about an inevitable loss of your sanity and whatever you hold dear. Trail of Cthulhu does that too. We both knew, before the game, what we wanted the game to be about: and Trail of Cthulhu does that, because the mechanics get out of our way.<br/><br/>What do you think? <br/><br/>By the way, I agree ToC has flaws in the design. But I rather like flawed games. I think that Poison'd, too, has flaws, but it's one of my favourite games.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192012/#Comment_192012" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T20:43:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  8:43PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>Is that idea intended as a subtle house rule or as a totally different game?

Personally, I love mood-heavy play with minimal rules contact, so "mechanics that get out of the way" sounds appealing.<br/><br/>But I have to ask, from that perspective, what do you see the game's rules contributing?  If the answer is "nothing", then what's the game's value?  An encyclopedia of color for inspiration?<br/><br/>(Note: those are actual questions and I am interested in actual answers!  This is not internet dismissiveness!)<br/><br/>My own take is that the cycle of "discover stuff &amp; encounter monsters -&gt; lose Sanity" <i>should</i> be front and center, for two reasons:<br/>1) it provides some tools to facilitate a certain version of "play Lovecraft", which might actually help a play group realize that version<br/>2) it signals to prospective players and GMs which version of Lovecraft they'll be doing, and thus gets them on the same page<br/><br/>If I "enjoy playing Lovecraft", but don't like the version of it that ToC supports, I can make an informed choice about whether to (a) buy the book just for color &amp; inspiration or (b) save my $40.<br/><br/>Further, if I understand what ToC excels at, I can better play toward those strengths.  For example, I plan to ruthlessly blast the hell out of my PCs' Sanity so we can quickly get to the parts of play that include establishing phobias, megalomania, memory loss, etc.<br/><br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192039/#Comment_192039" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T02:26:48+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  2:26AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Is that idea intended as a subtle house rule or as a totally different game?

This means you have certain dials to set before you can make decisions about the style of play. <br/><br/><i>So now, my thought on "how to GM ToC" is a mandate that appears nowhere in the book, and it is this: build in opportunities for Mythos Shocks and for gaining Mythos Lore. I still think learning the horrible truth will be fun, but those opportunities may well be where the biggest payoffs lie.</i><br/><br/>I thought that we'd made it fairly clear that going mad after experiencing the "Big Reveal" is a major part of play, and the core part of Purist play, so yes, you are right. The main difference between Pulp and Purist is that in Purist games, it's an exploration of the characters' descent into insanity, and there is nothing they can do about the Mythos, whereas in the Pulp game, it's the courage of the Investigators in the face of Mythos threats, with the PCs attempting to minimize Sanity and Stability loss while confronting the Mythos, and to the extent that they can, mitigating its effects. Players can try to avoid gaining Mythos Shock by working things out with using the Mythos - this is encouraged.<br/><br/>I'm sorry it wasn't as clear as you'd prefer, but yes, the game you want to play is explicitly supported by the mechanics, and importantly, the adventure creation guidelines. The other thing I'd direct you at is the Special Benefits page which shows how, mechanically, players can use clever point spends to increase their chances of survival, minimize mental damage, and avoid problems. Mythos lore is both a carrot and a stick - you want to know, but you don't want the Sanity loss.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the difference in what you and Graham do with the game is simply the spectrum between Pulp and Purist covered in the rules.<br/><br/>A version of GUMSHOE with player-controlled narrative elements is in the pipeline, but Trail as it stands is a GM-strong game, with only a little player-centric narrative control. That's not to say that a pre-planned trail of clues is by any means the only way PCs can go, but it means there always is somewhere they can go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192058/#Comment_192058" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T05:09:09+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  5:09AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 5:10AM by Graham.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But I have to ask, from that perspective, what do you see the game's rules contributing?

Their contribution is to <i>get out of the way</i>. You need never worry that the mystery won't be discovered (because, for example, you failed a lockpicking roll). The rules ensure the mystery gets solved, so you can concentrate on whatever you want.<br/><br/>(That's the distinction between Design What Matters and Design What Doesn't Matter. If you Design What Matters, you're using the rules to support the style of play you want. If you Design What Doesn't Matter, you're using the rules to deal with a particular part of play, so you can concentrate on what matters).<br/><br/>So, largely, I think that's the contribution of the rules: they get out of the way, leaving you to play Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Also, don't dismiss the idea of an encyclopedia of colour. Cthulhu is, I think, almost <i>all</i> colour. That's why you play Cthulhu. <br/><br/>So there you go and...er...having said all that...I think there's one thing that Trail does <i>very</i> well, that's supported by the mechanics. Basically, it's Drives. Trail is very, very good at stories with this Lovecraftian theme: whatever Drives you is crushed, as you realise how powerless you are against an unknowable Mythos. It supports that with the Drive mechanics and the Sanity/Stability ones.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192086/#Comment_192086" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T09:29:36+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  9:29AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Simon,<br/><br/>Now that I know you're reading, I feel bad about being so harsh.  There's a lot about the ToC book that I like!  The fact is, though, that I set out explicitly to write a Purist adventure, and the support I found for that did not drive into my brain "use Mythos Lore and Mythos Shocks thusly:".<br/><br/>My point in this thread was to discuss some elements of Simulationist design.  If you could talk further about design decisions behind both "how to GM" and "how to present how to GM", that would be awesome here.<br/><br/>We could talk about Purist vs Pulp too, but let's wait on that, because I think I already understand it.  For what it's worth, I think it was a great idea to take the two poles of the "play Lovecraft" spectrum, label them explicitly, and then provide tips specific to those poles throughout the text.  If Graham and I sat down to play together, that'd probably help us get on teh same page.<br/><br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192088/#Comment_192088" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T09:44:58+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  9:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>What's the difference between "get out of the way" and "wasn't there in the first place"?  <br/><br/>Are you saying that the mechanics can in fact be useful when desired, but can be ignored when not desired?  <br/><br/>Or are you saying they are <i>consistently</i> useful, but useful on a different scale than, say, PTA's Screen Presence?

But a lot of people like the original CoC system and often describe it as a system that would "get out of the way." In some of those cases, people meant we can ignore the rules as desired and they are so easy to interpret in multiple ways you can wrap the interpretation around your current interests. The system also informs narration by inspiring it (the skill lists are evocative) rather than constraining it (using constraining as a very positive word here as I feel constraints fuel creativity and strategy).<br/>\n<br/>\nToC "gets out of the way" in a different way (possibly in addition to the way CoC does but also in a different way). In ToC the system handles the heavy lifting in the background to let you focus on what you want to focus on in the foreground. It's different than "wasn't there in the first place" in a subtle way. It feels like it was never there while still being functional and directly influencing play in a consistent manner. The rules work. The rules matter. You just don't need to do much with them to get them to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192098/#Comment_192098" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T10:34:00+00:00" title="February 11, 2009 10:34AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 10:38AM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm not Graham, but I play him on the Canadian version of his life TV show. <br><br>What John said is very much on. I'd add to that the idea that in a game, especially a rich Sim game, there are a lot of issues going on all at once. Some of those issues are focal, some are important, some are both, and many are neither. Many Indie games make their rules to deal with the issues that are both focal and important, to the point that under the design paradigm many of us work under making rules that control and/or provoke the things that are focal and important is considered the whole point of design. <br><br>However, in the "design what doesn't matter" school, designers often try to make rules that deal with things that are important, but that are not focal. Of course this is a difficult thing, as important and focal shift from group to group, but its very different than "not there at all" in that it still takes care of something important to the game. <br/><br/>In Trail, and Essoterrorists, the rules are there to take care of something important: investigations (and to a lesser extent, combat, I guess). Those investigations are fucking important to most Cthulhu games. However, the investigation itself is often not actually the focal point of play. The investigation is what happens to hold the focal moments of play -- either the loss of sanity, the brave stand, the exploration of the creepy -- together as a coherent whole. <br/><br/>In that area I'm a target for Trail. I don't ever come to a Cthulhu game thinking "Oh wow, I'm going to solve a mystery!" I think "Oh wow, I'm going to face the moral disintegration of the world and fight shit with tentacles!" If you ask me how I'm going to do that, I may well say "Well, I'll investigate something that gets me in deep shit." But that investigation, you'll note, isn't actually the point. Its important, it lets the game continue, but what makes the game go, what brings me to the table, is the other thing. <br/><br/>Trail runs the investigation, which is important but not focal, for me. That way I can worry more about fighting squid and reading Sanskrit than if I'm going to figure out a puzzle.<br/><br/>This is in contrast to other games where the way things the mechanics deal with are neither important nor focal. Like, say, much of the old World of Darkness stuff. (Not all of it, but a big chunk.) In those games I was coming to play gothic semi-supers who did political shit and were all clever while moping about. And much of the system didn't help with that -- as I didn't fight, didn't care about lists of powers, and so on. Thus the majority of the rules weren't focal and weren't important, and in play tended to vanish completely. (Notably, the character generation stuff worked -- but only to start things off, not to keep them going.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192125/#Comment_192125" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T12:38:28+00:00" title="February 11, 2009 12:38PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 12:42PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Urgh, semantics are bitchslapping me about.  I have to take "get out of the way" and "design what doesn't matter" so non-literally here that I don't think I can handle it.  How about this:<br/><br/>1) Among RPGs, there are all sorts of rules that <i>manage</i> the player experience of the game's focal points.  In many indie games, these rules are loud and plentiful.  In Trail of Cthulhu, they are fewer or more subtle.<br/><br/>2) Among RPGs, there are all sorts of other rules that <i>provide foundation</i> for the player's experience of the game's focal points.  In many games with a GM, only the GM has contact with these rules; the players have none.  Trail of Cthulhu is one such game (well, almost).<br/><br/>Yeah?<br/><br/>Being more specific about ToC: <br/><br/>The game states that the GM will use an ongoing investigation as an engine to create situations where the players can play what the game's about.  The rules provide some guidance about how the GM is to go about this.  The players don't see those rules.  However, the players do see a rule that tells them, "each scene has a clue that pushes the investigation forward to the next scene, and you will find it if the right player uses the right skill."  That rule is transparent, but non-onerous due to its near-zero search and handling time.<br/><br/>As for the game's focal points and the point of play, these things are in fact managed to certain extent.  Sanity is quantified, tracked, reduced, and referred to for effects during play.  Suggestions are provided for how freaked out you might act depending on your current Stability rating.  Depending on the GM's chosen density of Mythos Shock sources, the players might spend a lot of play time interacting with these mechanics, or very little.  This speaks to John's points about mechanics that can be used, ignored, or repurposed to taste.<br/><br/>As design choices, all of these stand in stark contrast to certain games (which I don't know very well) which structure most moments of play to non-negotiably keep the spotlight on the game's focal points.  E.g., games where every Scene is a Conflict and every Conflict is about an Issue.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, there's no equally stark contrast between these aspects of ToC and, say, AD&amp;D 2.0.  AD&amp;D 2.0 also includes GM-facing rules about using setting to create situation (build a dungeon!), and player-facing rules about the point of play (power up with Experience Points!) that can be used as frequently as a given group desires.  <br/><br/>Perhaps in terms of discussing the specifics (rather than the broadest strokes) of ToC's design, we should be comparing it to other "trad" games, not the micromanaged games on the far end of the indie spectrum.  Before I go there, though, I'm gonna shut up for a bit to invite more responses to what's already been discussed here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192175/#Comment_192175" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T19:51:17+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  7:51PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth I missed that integral element which is at the heart of ToC (and well, Cthulhu in general) upon my first read as well.

It is fairly dense and in 13 pages covers pretty much everything. <br/><br/>One of the most important elements in GUMSHOE games is the structure and design of the adventure, because the adventure interacts so closely with the character creation and rules system, so we covered this up-front. We thought it was important to detail the techniques of managing the horror in the game at both a structural and game play level - the vital importance of mood, and the techniques to maintian it. As a result of playtesting, we added info on how to deal effectively with the resource-management elements of the General side of the game. Campaign development is given an overview, and then covered more thoroughly in the Campaign Frames section.<br/><br/>Using and placing Mythos is dealt with separately - it's important to realize there are two mental stats with subtly different effects. Loss of Stability is almost unavoidable; it's attrition, whereas Sanity and the Mythos are a short cut to the mystery, at the risk of loss of humanity. There is a long section dealing with railroading and the perception thereof - we learnt from the Esoterrorists playtest that any feeling of being railroaded by the GM was utterly unrelated to whether the GM was improvising furiously, or leading the players by the nose. No actual play followed the precise structure we laid out, and so this had to be addressed. Robin describes the system as a "small change with a big effect."<br/><br/>Certain system-based elements, in particular, Drives are not covered in the GMing section; perhaps we've taken too much for granted that reading their mechanical effect will demonstrate how they ought to be used, but they are thorough'y examined in the Player Tips section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192988/#Comment_192988" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T17:04:04+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  5:04PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re-reading certain passages in the ToC book, I think my complaints are mostly about emphasis via book design, and instructional strategy.  The info is all present, it's just that there's a lot of it, and I'm lost for a way to know what to focus on during which stage of my GM prep while being sure I haven't forgotten anything.<br/><br/>As for the actual play procedures themselves, I think ToC does a very interesting job of setting up the metaphorical "board" on which the game is to be played.  This isn't "initial situation, then Go!"  This is a structure, with spine, skeleton, clues, and victory condition, that the GM assembles in order to support and organize play, so that play can proceed and provide the Good Stuff.  <br/><br/>The GM gets to customize what the gameboard looks like, but must collaborate with the designers on how it behaves.  For example, the designers say, "Your gameboard must include Core Clues, which function in the way we specify," but the GM decides what kind of progression the trail of Core Clues creates, in terms of the Good Stuff.  Do the first several clues build up very subtle menace before the fifth one startlingly blows the players' minds?  Or is clue number one a horrifying Mythos Shock that plunges the PCs into desperate action as the world's end ticks ever closer?  The designers provide tips, explanations, and context, and the GM interprets that however he does and then arranges the predesigned pieces ("my first Clue goes here, my Horrible Truth goes here...") as he desires.<br/><br/>It's similar in some ways to a DM combing through a monster manual, selecting pieces to plop on the gameboard of "a dungeon".  However, a dungeon facilitates the Good Stuff in a different way -- it's a board that structures fictional <i>presence</i> but says nothing about fictional <i>sequence</i>.  ToC's board has sequence info aplenty.<br/><br/>It might be fair to say that, considered as Simulationist designs, ToC's aesthetic priorities are more tied to narrative properties than D&amp;D's are.  D&amp;D's aesthetics can work with or without producing play arcs that resemble any particular genre of literature/film/TV/comics.  The game's reward cycle can function in a variety of contexts, and the DM is left to choose which one.  As long as players get opportunities to do the things that earn XP, and then receive the benefits from leveling up, play can be an empire-toppling odyssey or a single room that keeps spewing monsters.<br/><br/>ToC, on the other hand, makes an aesthic decision to connect its reward cycle to narrative elements in a particular way.  In essence, it declares, "This isn't just any game where you show up to riff on 'gaining weird knowledge drives you mad'.  This is a game where you riff on 'gaining weird knowledge in the midst of unfolding investigations drives you mad'."  That's part of the shared reference material that provides for meaningful interaction in play, via players epitomizing it, warping it, testing it, etc.<br/><br/>Gah, that all sounded kind of like, "Let me explain to you how things work."  That's not my intent.  It's more my connecting the dots for myself out loud, and hoping to spur more observations and conversation.<br/><br/>I think it's fascinating how the two concerns of:<br/><br/>1) which stuff do we include in defining our aesthetic priorities for this game, and<br/>2) what kind of properties and behaviors do we include in the foundation (aka "gameboard") that structures and supports play<br/><br/>intertwine.
