It's going to be one of those rare ones that I'll probably give away to one of my friends when I'm done with it, because of some of the disturbing imagery of violence (I've got some major issues against brutal violence against women...to the point of feeling ill sometimes...but this isn't supposed to be some Freudian psychological examination of my problems).<br/><br/>But anyway, the point of this thread is some inspiration I received from the start of the show. The first two episodes are actually, chronologically, near the end of the series, with one of the main characters brutally slaughtering former teammates, friends, acquaintances and innocents, up until the point where she's about to strike down the girl she considers a sister. But before we find out what happens, time rewinds to a few years earlier, and progresses with how the girls met, grew up, worked with their secret agency to fight the phantoms, eventually leading up to the inevitable corruption of one of them, and the horrible events that we see in the first two episodes.<br/>And so I was thinking, that would make for an interesting start to a game campaign. Well, not so much the brutal slaughter and horrible imagery, but to start a campaign at a point where two or more of the characters are in direct conflict with the others, and tensions have come to a critical point where some drastic decision must be made...and then rewind maybe several years. The players would know that something will go wrong, and they won't know what. They won't immediately know who might be in the wrong (or if there is a wrong...maybe they're being played against each other by outside forces? maybe they're actually trying to just pretend to deceive someone? they won't know for sure...all speculation).<br/><br/>So, here's the question: is there a way that such a campaign can actually be accomplished? Has anyone actually tried something like this? Are there tricks or ways the campaign should be handled to make this possible? Is there a game system that would work well with this concept?<br/><br/>...I'm just kinda wondering. Or, if this concept has been brought up before in a thread, please point me in the right direction.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323259/#Comment_323259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T22:09:20+00:00" title="May  5, 2011 10:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2011 10:10PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done a two (linked) campaign in the "past tense" before, using a narrator's point of view, and it added both to drama and comedy:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4866" rel="nofollow">Here's the thread.</a><br/><br/>I should really get back to that campaign sometime and come up with a final chapter, in which the characters chase the last remaining war criminal of the Imperial era - Luke Skywalker - through the Outer Rim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323262/#Comment_323262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T22:32:48+00:00" title="May  5, 2011 10:32PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I've done a two (linked) campaign in the "past tense" before, using a narrator's point of view, and it added both to drama and comedy:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4866" rel="nofollow">Here's the thread.</a><br/></blockquote>\nThat's prime-time gold.

That way, they'll know that at some point, things will come to a head, but they won't know who to watch out for or what situation will bring things to a head.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm envisioning players receiving secret character goals or triggers, things that, when they happen or are achieved, set off something else. I'm not sure how that would work (since I tend to think of things mechanically, rather than narratively), though it probably would have to be driven by the story. ...Perhaps <i>Microscope</i> would work best for this, after all...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323301/#Comment_323301" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T07:41:48+00:00" title="May  6, 2011  7:41AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about something like Misspent Youth's selling out?

I guess, if the individual scenes were given plenty of time between, so that a player couldn't then muck around with what has been announced ("what? he's going to die? not if I can help it!") it would be effective.<br/><br/>Plus, I'm wondering if one would need to utilize some technique so that the players would know that what the GM is announcing is intended as "part of the story," as opposed to "this might happen" or "suggestion of things to come." Maybe a specific "announcer voice"? Or, perhaps borrowing from Microscope, writing significant events that the players have no control over onto index cards and setting them down on a timeline?

I am sad.<br/><br/>And yeah, for me, up until the blood starting splurting EVERYWHERE at the end of the first episode, I was thinking "HOT DAMN THEY'VE HIT THE SPOT!" When minor character number one drops, I'm thinking "HOT DAMN THEY'RE UPPING THE ANTE!" When minor character number two drops, I'm like "...uh, okay, so someone's gonna do something heroic...right?"<br/>...and then the horror. Oh, the horror.<br/><br/>...but I still want a kick-ass motorcycle with glowing holy runes to fight the undead...But that'll have to wait until I do some supernatural special-ops playset of Danger Patrol, or something.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Well, but you're already positting that Really Big Events can't be influenced by player characters by virtue of giving the ending first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mattastic</cite>I'm not sure how it would work without player cooperation.</blockquote>\nYeah, I guess it really needs that up-front "when I've set something down as 'it happens,' you can't try to change that" instruction to the players at the beginning. I think part of my worrying about this is having played with people, on a regular basis, who will do EVERYTHING they can to make things work out the way they want, whether it works for the game or not...but that's neither here nor there. I probably wouldn't have this fear if I played with other indie-enthusiasts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
