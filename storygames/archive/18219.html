I tried introducing the game/system a while back and they were totally turned off the complexity of it. Hence my question, as I'd like to preserve the intended feel (if at all possible)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411195/#Comment_411195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-03T12:01:00+00:00" title="April  3, 2013 12:01PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have run a full campaign of BE before, and I ran a campaign of BW that used the Kingdoms mod (adds the meta-plot mechanics into BW) for about 6 months before I had to end it to do time constraints. <br/><br/>I have also created a very simple re-creation of the same mechanics for Smallville using the Doom pool, with episodes and seasons breaking it up. It worked well, had the same feel, and was significantly less complicated. <br/><br/>And this sort of thing has been done many times with Fate. I believe Shadow of Anglerre has plot mechanic already added into it, but you could probably find more by looking around for something called the Fate Fractal.  <br/><br/>It all just comes down to how detailed you want the rules to be, and what you like. <br/><br/>The biggest thing is make sure your players are on board with the concept. A lot of people just really do like the concept of abstracting a meta level of the story through mechanics.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
