I really like the game. But for some reason, creating scenes using the method in the book felt difficult. Not nearly as easy as it is in something like Fiasco or Durance. I just can't put my finger on why.<br/><br/>Here's an example. One of the Events in our game was "Terrorists sink the Parisian Treasure Fleet". We were in the middle of a lens about the (still loosely defined) existential threat to the old world. The person creating the lens introduced some kind of "deadly" rock that was brought to the old world from the new world. That scene the king of Oceangland ended up sending the rock back to the new world. This happened previous to the Treasure Fleet event.<br/><br/>So I knew what I wanted to introduce via a scene. I wanted to indicate that the Treasure Fleet carried more of these deadly rocks, and their sinking spread them all over the old (underwater) world. But I didn't want to just narrate a scene. I wanted to get input from the other players about who sunk the fleet, and why. So I asked "Who sunk the treasure fleet?" But of course, the "who" was answered merely by the players picking characters. But that meant there wasn't room to enjoy the moment, or for me to introduce the deadly rock cargo. I know Microscope wants each scene to be directed toward a concrete goal, but sometimes I just want to enjoy seeing things unfold and live "in the moment".<br/><br/>What are others experiences with setting up Microscope scenes? Were we just thinking about them incorrectly? Does it just take practice making good scene questions? Do you find it difficult when you want to both learn from others and introduce a detail at the same time? Or am I just trying to do too much in a scene?<br/><br/>I do really like the idea of someone playing Time, and keeping things from wandering too far afield.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438405/#Comment_438405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T21:53:21+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  9:53PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2014 10:09PM by amphigorist.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have found scenes to be occasionally a bit tricky. In general, my best advice, which I think is in the book, is to ask questions that genuinely interest you. It sounds like that wasn't the case for your question. Why were the deadly rocks on the treasure fleet? is maybe what you wanted to ask. <br/><br/>Why is usually better than who or what (tho there are tricks to formulate a good who or what question, I suspect). So you could have asked: Why did the admiral allow the fleet to be sunk, even tho he knew the deadly rocks were on board? That question auto adds the element you wanted, and can only be answered in play. "Why this despite that" is a super structure for scene questions, straight from the book. This only works if the despite is genuinely strange or surprising tho. If there is a too-obvious reason the admiral would want this to happen, like he's an enemy of the old world, then the scene will lack tension. <br/><br/>Scenes really need the anxiety that comes from the question, in my experience. If people dig their characters, sometimes they will delay answering for a little bit just to hang out with this group, and that can be fun, but the clock ticking down to the end of the scene enables that to seem meaningful and not just aimless.<br/><br/>That said, sometimes a scene just works and sometimes it doesn't. I've had badly formulated questions that were almost answered by character picks that then played out with a beautiful sense of tension and dread, and scenes with great questions that everyone was too timid to answer definitively and the scene dragged.  It's tricky. <br/><br/>I really love playing out scenes, tho. It's hard for me and most of the people I have played with not to want to do a scene every turn.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press" title="kelmscott_press"><img alt="kelmscott_press" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press">kelmscott_press</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438410/#Comment_438410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T03:09:10+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  3:09AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that Questions in Microscope are both great and tricky. Great because they give scenes focus and provide a clear point to cut; tricky for all the reasons given above.<br/><br/>I second everything amphigorist said. One thing I've found is helpful is to simply instruct players not to answer the question outright during character selection or initial thoughts, or in the first minute or two of playing the scene, BUT to strongly drive towards anwering it after that point.<br/><br/>If you definitely want to introduce a detail in a scene (like deadly rocks sinking) I'd definitely put it in during scene framing, probably in the question, as amphigorist indicates. Otherwise you'll be clashing up against the different ideas that other players (quite rightly) want to introduce via character selection and play. You don't want to plan ahead much in Microscope.<br/><br/>One common situation that I've found difficult is when a question is strongly centred around one character. For example, if our question is "Why does the head of the Mafia order a hit on his own mother?", and the head of the Mafia is in the scene. It's awkward for the Mafia don's player to avoid answering the question during initial character thoughts; conversely, if that key player runs out of ideas or gets distracted by some other aspect of the scene (they start planning how the Mafia is going to engage in war with the Yakuza), then it can be tricky for other players to bring things back on track. I'd appreciate any advice for how to handle that type of situation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438415/#Comment_438415" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T06:02:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  6:02AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2014 6:16AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, making great Scenes starts with a good Question.  Like much of Microscope, it helps to think kind of obliquely (like deinol asking "who sank the ship" when it seems the "why" was more interesting in hindsight); I think it is mainly something that just comes with practice.  And yes, Time can be very handy if you think a Scene is in danger of dragging.  In general, I think the shorter a Scene is, the better. <br/><br/>On the other hand, you can deliberately pose a Question that is not easily answered, if you just want to enjoy the scene texture for a while and everyone's on board with that; one of my group's most memorable Scenes came from the Question "What is life on Mars like under the rule of the Black Pharaoh" (from a space opera/Mythos game) and we just had a weird black-comedy/slice-of-life riff until we thought we were done.\n<blockquote>One common situation that I've found difficult is when a question is strongly centred around one character. For example, if our question is "Why does the head of the Mafia order a hit on his own mother?", and the head of the Mafia is in the scene.

I'd appreciate any advice for how to handle that type of situation!</blockquote>\nI find that for that kind of direct question about one specific character's motivation, it can be helpful to ban that character from being played!  That means the group ends up playing friends, advisors, and enemies of that person, and ultimately kind of externalizes their thought process, which I think is more fruitful than just a straight-up monologue from one player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438447/#Comment_438447" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T10:36:15+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 10:36AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will admit it was probably me wanting to do too much with a scene. I wanted to introduce the fact that deadly rocks were in the sunken fleet, which was not a known fact when the fleet event was introduced. But I also wanted to learn more about the terrorists and what led to the fleet's sinking. And the rules explicitly say not to introduce new things during the "set the stage" step. On the other hand, I should have asked "Why do the terrorists attack the treasure fleet?" or maybe "How does sinking the treasure fleet relate to the threat against the old world?" and introduced the rocks during the scene itself.<br/><br/>The thing we discovered that I didn't know going into the scene was that the terrorists were a coalition of dino freedom fighters from the new world and Scotrish separatists from the new world. And the dinosaurs were trying to recover the stolen sacred rocks, not destroy the fleet. But the fleet was pushed too close to the Oceangland defenses, who contributed to the fleets destruction.<br/><br/>So playing out the scene was cool, and we learned things. But it just felt awkward to try and fit what I wanted into the single question that Microscope wants us to ask. There are also times when I just want to get a taste for how something plays out, but don't really have a specific question I want to ask.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438448/#Comment_438448" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T10:45:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 10:45AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So playing out the scene was cool, and we learned things.
