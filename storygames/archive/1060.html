                    From this thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1051" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1051</a><br/><br/>There's gonna be those people at GenCon:<br/><br/>"Can I have a review copy of your game? Please? I promise to review it on my Livejournal, with at least three to five viewers..." etc.<br/><br/>In this day and age, who would you give a copy of your game to review?<br/><br/>Back in 99-2000, there was the "Justin Bacon" rule:<br/><br/>"Can I have a review copy?"<br/>"Are you Justin Bacon?"<br/>"...uh, no"<br/>"Then no."<br/><br/>Recently a lot of people seem to want to give Ken Hite a copy of their game, in the hopes that it makes it to his journals.<br/><br/>Who are the New Blood to give review copies to?<br/><br/>For me, I think the people to best be giving your review copies to are:<br/>1) Judd<br/>2) Paul Tevis<br/>3) Steve Darlington <br/><br/>Judd may review your game, but he'll certainly play a session of it, talk about that session, and that alone will drive about 50 sales flat out.<br/><br/>Paul will give it a thorough reading and fine review on his widely read podcast.<br/><br/>Steve D is a great pimper if he believes in your game.<br/><br/>Who else are some solid figures to give review copies to?<br/><br/>Also, do you have any feelings towards review copies? ("No one gets a review copy"; "If you buy and review my game, I'll then refund your money, whether the review was positive or negative"; "I'll subsidize half of your purchase if you review the game within 3 months", etc)<br/><br/>I waffle on Dan Davenport of RPGNet: His reviews are extremely thorough.  Unfortunately, each review could be a book. And I don't think I've actually read through a single of his reviews completely, ever. But if you like "reviews that are themselves books", he'd be a good catch.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            We gave a copy of the Roach to Ken Hite, because he's awesome but also because he gave the game some unsolicited praise.  That's it.  <br/><br/>The whole "tit for tat" nature of review copies strikes me as deeply weird in both directions.  I don't want to basically pay someone to say nice things about my work, and I definitely don't want to pay somebody to say mean things about my work - even if that, too, sells games.  I don't really review games, but if I did, I think I'd want to review things that I thought were interesting and that I could say good things about from a place of personal experience.  It seems like a strange potlatch relationship with the designer only blurs that equation, but what do I know?<br/><br/>I want to hear Paul and Judd talk about this.  Do people send you things?  Strippers, magnums of champagne, ziploc baggies of blue flake cocaine?  Does that influence you?                        </div>

                            Jeff and I have been offered free games and we talked about it and decided to turn them down.  We only talk about games we have played and both feel it is important to pay the game designers whose games we enjoy.  But we also made a very deliberate decision after last Gen Con to keep it positive on our podcast.<br/><br/>My threads are about games that I have bought and had a good time playing, simple as that.  I think the buying part of it is really important.  Selling games is a business and while posting in a meaningful way is certainly P.R., I want the threads I start to be more about honestly talking about my game experiences, rather than some sort of business transaction.<br/><br/>I'm a player of games, not a shill.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Yes it does, and Dave Younce just reminded me that I do sort of review games as part of the Durham 3.  I'm definitely with Judd there - we're usually talking about games we're playing, that we either purchased or are playtesting.  If somebody mailed us something cold, I don't think we'd touch it.                        </div>

                            Dan Davenport is one guy whose review I have consistently enjoyed. Don't know if he will be at gen Con this year, but he was the last time and a thoroughly nice chap he was. <br/><br/>But there's a lot to be said for people doing AP threads and showing their enjoyment (or otherwise) of the game through those. I respect Judd and Jeffs approach of refusing comp copies of games and buying and playing games, then talking about them. AP has probably sold me on more games than reviews. Nothing beats good word of mouth from someone who has paid for the game and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I'll pimp games like Best Friends and Dust Devils endlessly becaue I've played (or run) them and enjoyed the experience immensely, the same goes for many other games (too numerous to mention).<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

                            When you ask someone to do a review, do you stipulate where? Do you care very much? For instance, RPG.net obviously has a big audience...but on the other hand, I find the pieces there to be summaries more often than analytical reviews; and that's part of what's expected by its readers.                        </div>

<code>I'm a player of games, not a shill.</code><br/><br/>I'm both. <br/><br/>I mean that fairly seriously. I totally respect what Jeff and Judd do, because it really fits with their show. One of the reasons I love hearing about games from them is because I know their experience with games is battle-tested. If it didn't happen at the table, they're not saying it, which is really cool. For me, however, there are games I read and can see that are awesome, but that I know I'm probably not going to get a chance to play, or at least won't have a chance to play for a while. I still want to tell the world about these games, so other people can see how awesome they are and play them. So yeah, I'm a shill, but for awesomeness.<br/><br/>I have had people send me review copies of games. I've always tried to make it clear that I will only talk about games that I think are worth talking about and to set expectations appropriately. I'm not going to give games free advertising just because I got a copy, and I've had to tell people that I'm not going to review their games because they wouldn't like what I would say about the games. Similarly, if I know that a product is likely not the sort of thing I'm into, I'll let them know that before I let them give me copy.<br/><br/>Basically, it comes down to this. My show is "Paul's views on gaming." If someone wants to give me a copy of a game, I'll take it, I'll read it, if it's good hopefully I'll have time to play it, and I'll tell people what I think about it, because it's now a part of my gaming world. There are a number of great games that I probably wouldn't have picked up if people hadn't give me copies that I then discovered were awesome. These are the games I want people know about.<br/><br/>So for me, it's about expectations. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

                            Hm, to begin with, when I send my game(or at least once its published, right now I'm mainly looking for input) I'd be cool with people not saying anything if they don't like it, or giving their honest opinion(Dan Davenport, whose reviews I read regularly, even if the game doesn't interest me).<br/><br/>How do I pick? Hm, it's a mix between readership and play-style, for example, people who didn't like Polaris/DitV/Capes are unlikely to like CR, so why bother? And it goes the other direction as well.<br/><br/>BUT! Review copies are an easy trap to fall into, I do believe one needs to have a "Rule" and send copies to a predefined list and no one else.                        </div>

                            My hit list (in a nice way) for Dead of Night was pretty much Paul (thanks again Paul!), Ken H and Dan Davenport. As I wound up with a load of bonus, slightly damaged copies for free, I also chucked some of those out too to people who offered to review it, with mixed success. I think for my next book I might just chuck copies out to my hit list, or maybe not even that. Although I do feel guilty about people paying for my book and saying nice things ...                        </div>

                            My rule is:  "Anyone but me."  I seem to be completely incapable, regardless of enthusiasm, to talk up my games in a way that makes people interested in them on any sort of consistent basis.<br/>
<br/>
I only comp reviewers with PDFs though, and I generally wait to be approached - I don't want to randomly bother people with my game.                        </div>

                            Being a part of many playtests for review of Dan Davenport, I must say he is very fair and sometimes a bit nicier than I would be. I do agree his reviews can get long, but at least they are thorough.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br>My threads are about games that I have bought and had a good time playing, simple as that.  </br></blockquote>
And that simple honesty, enthusiasm, and enjoyment of said games is what has sold them for me in the past.  In a conversation last night where I was sharing Judd's Actual Play for Mortal Coil (which I subsequently bought), I actually tried to think which indie games I'd purchased in the last two years that I *hadn't* first gotten interested in as a result of one of Judd's posts.<br><br/>I think the list was... Inspectres, the First Sorcerer book... and maybe TSoY.<br/><br/>Everything else?  Judd was in there somewhere, and not because he's a salesman or a pitch-artist.  He's just a hell of a player/GM who happens (it turns out) to like a lot of the same games and stories that I do, and recounts the kind of game experiences that I aim for.<br/><br/>... and maybe all this is off-topic, or maybe it's more discussion about the kind of things buyers find worth noting.  I don't give much a damn about Ken Hite's column -- for that matter, I only read RPG.net or other site reviews when I'm already interested in a game via another source.<br/><br/>I like hearing from other gamers, playing the hell out of a game and gushing about it.                        </br></div>

                            I'll give a review copy of any game I make to anyone who actually reviews it, and that's that. Don't care who it is; as long as you post a review in a public place (rpg.net, gamingreport, your own blog, wherever).<br/><br/>Anyone want one?<br/><br/>(hmm... perhaps this would make a good new thread...)                        </div>
