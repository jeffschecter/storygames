It is its own thing, and has been loosely organized for years, and is great.  But you know how it goes - we started thinking.  I'm looking for some feedback on whether this would work:<br/><br/>What if we organized an event more akin to the <a href="http://24hourcomics.com/2007/hostfaq.html" rel="nofollow">24 Hour Comic</a> which was the initial inspiration?  So rather than an isolated thing, it'd be a social thing - people would meet locally, make games, share 24 hours of creativity, frustration, and pizza.  For this to work there would need to be well-organized regional volunteers to host, or find game stores that were into hosting, events.  In addition to the usual hotbeds of enthusiasm like NYC, there could be virtual communities committed to participating as well.  The bottom line would be a single date, a social event involving meeting others and sharing space and ideas, and a bunch of new roleplaying games.  <br/><br/>Would you want to do this?  Would it represent a significant improvement over working in isolation, just picking a date and opening fora for discussion?<br/><br/>Would you be willing to coordinate this locally?  It wouldn't have to be elaborate, but it certainly could be.  I could see it taking place in a retail store, for example, as the 24 Hour Comic events generally are.  <br/><br/>Share your ideas, please!  I'd love to invigorate the 24 Hour RPG and have some fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149275/#Comment_149275" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T09:36:47+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  9:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I'd be happy to enlist Game Empire Pasadena or Dicehouse Games Fullerton and play ringmaster for a day.<br/><br/>Question: how does the 24 hour part jive with a business that is not open 24 hours a day?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149284/#Comment_149284" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T09:58:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  9:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Question: how does the 24 hour part jive with a business that is not open 24 hours a day?</blockquote>\nI know that <a href="http://www.chapelhillcomics.com/content/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">Chapel Hill Comics</a> just locks the doors and keeps on making comics all night.

It looked like a ton of fun and I definitely think the in-person aspect improves the experience dramatically, as does the <i>lack of computers</i>, two things that 24RPG might consider.  There's something about crowding around tables with a bunch of local hobby enthusiasts and crafting things with your hands.<br/><br/>You could even enlist other creators to playtest bits of them as you went, which would be hot.

On the page I link to they stress that organizers insist that nobody drive after the 24 hours are up, which is sensible.  <br/><br/>I'm pretty confident we could organize one in the RDU area as well, either in a store or private dwelling.  They say you should have a host who does not participate, also.  <br/><br/>I totally agree that a bunch of dudes with notebooks and pencils and a fever will come up with a different array of games than the same dudes sequestered at computers with layout programs and links to Perez Hilton.

The 24-page goal / limit from the 24-hour comics guidelines is also something worth considering, I think.  It gives a concrete amount of work for people to focus on, instead of the nebulous concept of "a game."  Also, with a small number of pages required, it means you can really focus on making the game work and be a fairly decent game, instead of just cranking up the wordcount.  Now, it may be that 24 pages is a too easy goal for an RPG, but I'm not sure about that.  Sure, anybody can probably fill up 24 pages, but 24 pages of what?  That's the real challenge.<br/><br/>2.

Free advertising is a win for the hosting store.<br/><br/>(2) Getting gamers to agree on a date can be like herding cats.

Tad, I don't see any reason to change what's working - the process of writing and submitting a one-off 24 hour RPG doesn't need to be messed with and there's a little community of people who are really into that, but that's not what we're talking about here.  Our original thought was to create an event closely modeled on the comics version, which is "On October 20, everybody does this thing."  <br/><br/>I started this thread to poke some holes in that model, and it looks like a big hole is that various regional groups might want to schedule it on their own time.  That's fine, but I definitely see the strength in choosing the same 24 hours across the board - excitement, camaraderie, maybe live connections around the globe .  Let's talk about ways that is problematic.  Again, we're just exploring ideas here!  <br/><br/>Josh - the comics thing goes down in October, so I was thinking of getting some synergy with that if the hands-on thing ends up being on a specific date.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149956/#Comment_149956" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T05:20:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  5:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 5:28AM by Matthijs.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to set this up in Oslo, Norway.

So I don't think there's any particular reason we should have to follow the single-day event guidelines.  Additionally, even on the <a href="http://www.24hourcomics.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">24 Hour Comics Day blog</a>, you can see signs that many groups continue to organize 24 hour comics events on other days (like the Comics Drawpocalypse in Portland).  I guess I just think it would be a shame if 24-hour RPGs become just a once-a-year thing.  By all means, it'd be cool to schedule a couple dates a year when multiple 24-hour RPG events would be happening at the same time, but I strongly dislike the idea of one official day, since it institutionalizes an idea that nobody owns, something that anyone can do any time they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149972/#Comment_149972" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T06:43:55+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we may be miscommunicating...<br/><br/>I don't want to change the "pick a 24 period and write a game" aspect at all.  That's fun and works well, so you know, leave it alone, right?<br/><br/>I really like the idea of organizing local events, coming together, and making games in a focused and intense environment.  I think that has a ton of potential.  The two things aren't at all exclusive!  There have been periodic "grand events" associated with the 24 hour RPG in the past, but they've been focused on the Internet.  I'm suggesting we continue the grand event tradition, but localize it and get people to meet face to face and maybe put their computers away (I love this aspect more and more).  Even if we get this together, there's nothing stopping SG Boston from hosting their own Gamepocalypse every six months or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149985/#Comment_149985" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T07:18:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I guess.  I'm just worried that focusing on a single day every year will end up with only secondary support for people wanting to organize their own event locally, on their own schedule.  And my personally preferences lean towards decentralized organization, so in the event that something happens at the center, the branches can still function.  Like what if we pick a date for an event, and then the "worldwide" date gets named a couple weeks / months later and is widely publicized.  Then, local people get confused on what date to show up and get all like "Why aren't you doing it on 24 Hour RPG Day?"  But I'll try not to let that kill my excitement for this project too much.  I just get much more excited about trying to organize events locally than trying to coordinate with what people are doing in other parts of the country / world, which seems like it brings unnecessary complications.  For example, I'd be much more excited about a designated month for events to happen within, which would give local groups more flexibility in scheduling.  I'd just love the national / worldwide organization to serve the interests of the local groups ultimately responsible for putting on these events, not the other way around.  I don't want to feel like a franchise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150061/#Comment_150061" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:59:45+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>24 pages seems like a grossly excessive length to me.

We're going to go talk to a local story next weekend.<br/><br/>Why would this be in October when the comics day is alreay in October? How about January or February?<br/><br/>I think the only rules should be that you keep working on RPGs for the full 24 hours and that you <i>attempt</i> to finish every RPG you start (and help other do the same). If people want to work individually, in groups, or all together on one game, that's all up to the participatns at each site. If quickdraws like shreyas finish their first game early, they can start another one, write and playtest Roleplaying Poems, or help others with their designs.<br/><br/>So it's my impression that this <b>shouldn't</b> be advertised as an indie/story style thing. Let everyone who wants to design a game, in any style, show up and participate. Everyone should try to be equally supportive of all the other participants' games - even if some of those games aren't what you would normally play. I bet the comics folks have to deal with differing styles, genres, etc, so maybe someone with experience there would have advice on how to keep all the different styles working together in harmony. But I don't see it as a huge concern if the organizers lay down the basis of support and cooperation at the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155595/#Comment_155595" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T07:17:25+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  7:17AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are good ideas, Scott.

A freindly heads-up and test of the waters would be great, though.<br><br/>Here's what I'm thinking at the moment:<br/><br/>1.  We pick a date for a big event.  If this rends your soul, you can pick a different date, but the goal is excitement around a shared experience and collaboration.  The date will not mesh with the comics event, for good reasons pointed out above.  We don't want to try retailer's patience.  None of this precludes writing your own 24 hour RPG whenever you feel like it.  <br/><br/>2.  We invite retailers to host, but don't limit the contest to retail places.  Any host can host for whatever slice of the 24 hours they like.  If a store does not want to stay open all night, they can ask the designers to adjourn to the Pancake House at midnight.  Individuals can open their homes, we can rely on individual initiative, and the "event" piece can be structured around collaboration, playtesting, and general getting-togetherness within the parameters the local host provides.  People can also scatter and work alone.  Maybe there is an Internet-based synchronous group as well.<br/><br/>3.  I'd love to add some sort of "walkathon" type angle, where people pledge to give a charity cash in exchange for our 24 hours of labor somehow.  I think that would be fun and positive, and I'm open to ideas about how to work something like that.  It also opens up the possibility of competition between local groups, which would be fun.  We could raise a ton of cash for some worthwhile global charity doing something we love.<br/><br/>4.  I'm not sure how to approach this, but it'd be great if we could share and redistribute the output of the event.  Again, I'm open for ideas about how to do that.  If we encourage people to design analog, it'd be really neat to put together a book that was nothing but scans of the game designs as written/sketched/diagrammed.  Or maybe both the original hand-made game and a playtested, readable, laid-out version side by side.  This may be too ambitious or unrealistic, I don't know.<br/><br/>I think this structure will be appealing to hosts, it is flexible and friendly, and beyond the games produced, it would increase the good in the world as well.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155960/#Comment_155960" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T17:47:15+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  5:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was with you up until the walk-a-thon type angle. The only reason I didn't participate in St. Baldrick's this year was that I couldn't get any sponsors. For me, the quickest way to kill an event is to make people beg money from charities for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to support a charity, great, but it can really cut down on participants if you have to get a freaking sponsor (Or was this an attempt to limit participation? Were you expecting an overwhelming response like Game Chef almost was this year?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as putting together scans, well, I live in a high-tech area so I don't forsee that being a problem. People would probably be tickled pink to know that their stuff would go into a booklet or an on-line post of some kind (Hey! There's MY game!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can play out the charity angle on that side. Free to participate. You don't need a sponsor, but we're going to be selling this little book with proceeds going to a charity? Sign up for a charity to get part of the proceeds, then buy copies for your freinds and family? I dunno, more suggestions are needed but I know that the sponsorship idea would turn me right off (and make me cry, to boot!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[24 Hour RPG] What if it were more like Comics? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6729/24-hour-rpg-what-if-it-were-more-like-comics/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[24 Hour RPG] What if it were more like Comics? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6729/24-hour-rpg-what-if-it-were-more-like-comics/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Any participation in any aspect is going to be voluntary.

I can do that at home. Unlike 24-Hour Comic, there aren't any resources at a game store that I would need to write a game that I wouldn't have at home (in fact, the local game stores are lacking most of the books I would want to reference that <i>are</i> in my basement). So if the intent is not to work together on creating a game, I don't see the point in getting everyone together in the same room for 24 hours.<br/><br/>So maybe I missed the point right off the bat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156291/#Comment_156291" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T06:36:28+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  6:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you are missing the point, Scott.  The 24-hour comic doesn't provide resources either, it provides community and comraderie with the purpose of finishing a project in a short amount of time.  It is a gauntlet through which you are supported by your fellow participants.<br/><br/>Jason, the likelihood of strong disagreements over how to handle things like rights (cross reference Names Book, Game Chef 2004 book, most other compilation projects I can think of) and other details is why I was suggesting a loose overall structure that is then implemented locally, with the local organizers handling the concrete details.  Central organization is definitely important, but as a rallying point for interest.  Avoiding as much center-local tension as possible is only going to make it an easier and more positive experience for everyone, and I imagine many local groups will have strong feelings about how best to run the event in their area.<br/><br/>Basically, imagine the 24 hour RPG event like you're releasing a game. When you put Business Solutions out there, you're giving people a bunch of tools, but, in the end, they have to put it get a group together and decide when and how to play, which may or may not look a lot like the play you're imagining in your mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156296/#Comment_156296" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T08:12:59+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  8:12AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2008 8:20AM by scottdunphy.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I really thought it was a group effort of some kind.

Looks interesting and I wish I had noticed it before they had started week 2 of the event.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Dyson - who is planning to set aside 24 hours mid next week to write his own game for the challenge)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6729/24-hour-rpg-what-if-it-were-more-like-comics" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6729/24-hour-rpg-what-if-it-were-more-like-comics" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6729/24-hour-rpg-what-if-it-were-more-like-comics/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6729%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6729%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
