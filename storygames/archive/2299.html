                    I was talking with Nathan about this at Dreamation, and I think that in the indie games exploded world it's a pretty big deal, so I want to have a talk about it.  I have a few proposed solutions, but mostly I just want to hear opinions.<br/><br/>So there's two things that go on at IGE and both are important and valuable and I want to keep them, but they also interfere with each other.<br/><br/>1) IGE is a place where people come to try out these new kinds of games, looking for a new kind of fun, and as such in many ways it's a place where we, as progressive designers, should put our "best foot forward" with regard to games.<br/><br/>2) IGE is a place where a lot of new designers come with their untried games to figure out what to do with them.  Often, playing these games isn't fun at all but it does provide very useful feedback for the designer, which can be useful in making the game good, later.<br/><br/>Can people see how these two things are contradictory to each other?  I don't want someone to sign up for an untried or barely-tried game and have the experience suck, and come away with the thought that "all those indie games are just half-baked and unfun."  At the same time, a vigorous playtesting culture is absolutely vital to our community, and ought to be present at cons as well.<br/><br/>I've got some of my own thoughts about this but I'd like to hear other people's opinions first.  I'm likely to take a low view of people posting saying "this isn't a problem at all!" unless they have some very solid reasoning to back that up.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                </div>

                            Here's a distinction I'd like to draw for the purposes of this thread: Playtest versus preview.<br/><br/>Playtesting is an untried / barely tried game that just isn't really fun yet.  It could be fun, but the designer just doesn't know.<br/><br/>Previewing is playing a game which is already basically done, having gone through several playtest cycles, and is now consistently fun every time it is played, but just isn't published yet.  Previewing doesn't have the same tension with outreach that playtesting does.<br/><br/>The line that Nathan and I drew was "%90 chance of awesome."<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            I saw that at least two designers had put their playtest games into the schedule and clearly marked them as playtests in the title. For example, Shawn had "One Night - Playtest" in the schedule. I don't think it hurts the reputation of indie game publishers when players see the process, as long as they're clear on what they're getting into. I think it reflects well on us, in fact, to let the public know that our design process relies on actual play and allows them to be a part of this. <br/><br/>Involving these players in the design process is cool. I recommend explaining at the session's start what the game is, and a little about the design process. Make it clear that you're running a playtest. Be clear about the status of your design -- is it rough? beta-ish? polished and almost done? Get these players on the same page as you: let them know what parts of the game you want to test and what you think might happen. Set aside a half hour or more at the end to talk about the game and how it went. Tell them up front that you're going to that, too.                        </div>

                            This is a completely valid concern. From the perspective of a forum lurker, I kind of have an idea what the tried-and-true games are vs. things which are newly in development, and if my mode and modus at a convention is to play games for the purpose of having fun, I'm going to seek out those games that I've been told are great but I haven't yet had a chance to play.<br/><br/>The ugly truth of the matter is that not everyone who shows up and wants to play IGE games reads the forums, and might not know the difference between old reliable and the new, untested hotness. Imagine you're a gamer who has only heard tell of the independent gaming <i>Shangri-la</i>, you show up to a Con, don't know the difference between any of the games, and sign up for one at random. You might get a great game, you might get a playtest (probalistically less likely, I'd wager, to be a great game) and, like you said, have a sour taste in your mouth for the movement.<br/><br/>However, I think there's a very natural solution to this which is probably already in effect. For starters, people who are new to IGE have probably heard about Dogs or Burning Wheel or Polaris or any number of other established, older games and will want to dig into those first. Second, I find it likely that people who are involved in the community and hatching new game ideas are going to want to work with the ("older") members of the community who already have a good grounding in other indie games, if only because they'll be much more able to suss out problems and offer very focused, constructive criticism. <br/><br/>From a practical perspective, it might be wise to coyly note in an event description that its a playtest, or the game isn't yet published. I think this'd give uninformed players enough warning to steer clear if they're looking for a really polished game to sink their teeth into.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, this is a problem.</p>
<p>I think what I percieved as happening worked pretty well - the "official", scheduled and promoted, games that I noticed going on or heard about (by no means all of them) were finished, polished games, in many cases with polished con scenarios that had been tested out on other groups. The playtest games were much lower in profile and tended to involve people drawing in their friends and design cliques to jam face-to-face, with the implication that some of the thinking going into those sessions was remote discussion.</p>
<p>That's the kind of solution I'd like to see supported and structured in a more formal way, but without losing the fundamental distinction that you can pretty much walk in and play a completed game, but a playtest is something that calls for a little more investment.</p>

                            I like the distinction between playtest and preview.  I'll submit that you need a "this may not be fun" disclaimer prefacing either, but you ideally want total strangers for a preview and total friends for a playtest.  Mechanical and thematic feedback from people you know and trust is more valuable than that of strangers, but actual play and at-table reactions and behaviors are the exact opposite.  <br/><br/>I think clearly labeling sessions as playtest or preview is a great start.  I think there is also a space for shorter sessions for both of these, possibly by having two designers partner for two hour sessions (breaking the four hour block probably isn't a good idea).                        </div>

                            I think labelling's a good solution: not quite, as Blake suggested, to "coyly note" it's a playtest, but to label it as PLAYTEST in big letters. So, "PLAYTEST: Heist".<br/><br/>You can advertise playtests positively, though. Tell people it's a risk, it's an untested game, it could crash or burn or it could soar, we'd love their input on a developing game.<br/><br/>Of course, that needs people to be honest about how ready their game is.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            As a player, I'd certainly want some kind of warning about the "done-ness factor" of a pre-publication game. And I say that as someone who really enjoys getting my hands dirty with unfinished games, even if the fictional product/process isn't really firing. By the same token, though, I can't believe I'm the only person out there who finds the process of shaking down an incomplete game "fun" in its own warped way - which is a very different kind of fun from playing a finished, working game.                        </div>

                            I talked with a couple people about this at the con, and have been thinking about it.<br/><br/>I don't think there should be any pressure or anything on people NOT to schedule their games in development in regular game slots. I think it's good form to clearly indicate the status of the game, and anything else that may be unusual (like "the last 1/2 hour of this slot will be devoted to feedback and discussion about the game"), but other than that, if you wanna run your game in playtest for 4 hours, cool.<br/><br/>I do think that there should be some kind of structured thing for people who are playtesting a game that they may not want to run for 4 hours, or who know that the game needs play but may not be fun yet. I think that there are plenty of people out there (me included) who enjoy the act of playtesting and giving feedback on a game as it's own activity - the fun isn't necessarily in the game working, it's in helping the designer figure out what they're doing or how to fix problems. And, an organized thing would be very good in terms of fostering a community of playtest.<br/><br/>Some thoughts: should this thing be inside or outside of the normal convention organizational rubric? It is certainly possible to put together an organized but informal "Playtest Track", with timeslots and everything, as long as it can be publicized beforehand and on-site. Petitioning con organizers to create an RPG Playtest track is also an option.<br/><br/>An option that I like a lot is along the lines of what Jason mentioned above; scheduling a Playtest Event in a standard 4-hour game slot. The Playtest Event has, say, 12 slots open, and 2-3 designers bring their game in development. They could run side-by-side playtests, or play one game for 2 hours and another for 2 hours, or have two groups that each play for 2 hours and then switch game, so you effectively get 2 games of it in. This has the advantage of, if only 1 person signs up and 2 designers are already there, you have a group of 3, which may be big enough to playtest anyway.<br/><br/>So, yes. Talking about this is good.                        </div>

                            cross-posted with Nathan:<br/><br/>It's my impression that the really less finished games (playtest) are often played off the record, like Nathan's run of Carry at Dreamation last year. It was a pick-up he did on the spur of the moment, so everyone who took part were folks who knew that up front and were willing to give it a go.  <br/><br/>I'd agree that putting games at preview stage (or late playtest at best) on the schedule, would be the best course of action.  Or label early playtests as a "game workshop", soliciting players who want to get their hands dirty and help out. <br/><br/>Though, I'd still recommend to people that they find friends and volunteers to do that, especially since there are so many who would love to do so in this community.  You still might catch folks unawares of what's really involved if you advertise.<br/><br/>A "Playtest Event" sounds great.                        </div>

                            Oh, one more thing - we should quickly come up with a different word (workshop sounds good) to distinguish quarter-baked from three-quarter-baked.

                            Was this an actual issue? That is, did people hear, or overhear, genuine attendees complaining about this? If folks want me to ask Vinnie for more space particularly for playtests, I'd like to know what's actually happening on the ground. While I can certainly see it as a possible problem, I'm asking if it's an actual one.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm not saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" I <i>would </i>like to point out that I did a quick review of the event descriptions, and all of them except One Night (which is in the 90% done place, I think), Bliss Stage, and Kat's  Everway/Into The Mystic session identified themselves as playtest sessions or games-in-development. We could make it a little more prominent, certainly.<br/>

On the other hand, having a game workshop that's separate from the roundtable could probably be done, so long as we have designers willing to commit.                        </div>

                            It's not that it's a problem, or even that I think it will be a problem (in terms of "dude, I can't beleive this is a playtest, how lame!" comments, or stuff like that).

                            Were I the draconian overlord of the IGE, here's what I'd do -- make a policy that all games scheduled on the convention grid be published games (even if "published" just means a free online download). Flat-out. No "preview" or "playtest" division. If it ain't already working and being played, don't schedule it during a convention slot. The scheduled slots would be the public face of the IGE.<br/><br/>Now, I've personally benefitted from running playtest sessions at the local Double Exposure cons. I'm not saying not to have it going on, just not putting it out there with the finished games. Running games is a service that we provide in return for (a) our free convention passes, (b) exposure for our games, and (c) the joy of seeing our creations bring people delicious fun in four-hour bites. Playtesting our games is a service participants provide us, not the other way around. If you're a writer and you give someone a book you wrote just for them, that's a cool present. If you give someone a manuscript you're working on and ask for feedback, that's a burden you've dumped on them, not a present at all.<br/><br/>So, how to gain the benefit of playtesting at the conventions? Simple...the playtests (and previews, as well) run off the grid. Making an internal schedule is great, but it has nothing to do with the convention program. We can even invite folks who show up at the booth or play indie games -- "Hey, if you liked this, you might want to get in on the secret playtest sessions of Game X. It's what all the cool kids are doing, anyway. It's a lot of work, but you get to have a hand in shaping the hot new games." This lets us put our best foot forward as a community, while still allowing for the vital process of peer review, analysis, and criticsm. It aslo makes it clear that this is something <b>quite different</b> from a normal play session. It also lets people feel like insiders, which is good because then they are <i>part of something</i>, as opposed to just <i>doing something</i>. I know that if Vincent or Tony or any of the other designers I look up to came to me and invited me to their room to playtest a new design, I'd be flattered and excited. If they asked me to fill out the slots on a playtest session they were running, I'd think it was a drag, even if I did it out of a sense of duty, friendship, community, or whatever.<br/><br/>If you absolutely felt the need to publish the playtest sessions to the gaming community at large, I'd say you could put one single convention-long event on the grid that has a pitch to sell the idea of getting in on the playtesting as a thing itself, rather than pitching a particular in-development design. Then you could just route people to whatever is testing at that time, or provide playtests on request.<br/><br/>Since I'm not the IGE draconian overlord, however, these are just my suggestions.                        </div>

                            I'm running a playtest event at Conception this weekend, which I'm dubbing Playtest Camp. We've got about 8 or 9 playtest manuscripts and I'm going to put events up specifically marked as PLAYTEST sessions. I imagine most of the games will end up with players I know (Graham, Rich and Geoff, specifically), but I'm hoping that some of them will attract curious folks too! But the important thing is that everyone will know what they're getting into - a playtest of an incomplete game.<br/><br/>I'll report back as to how it goes.                        </div>

                            As the closest thing the IGE has to an evil draconian overlord, Andrew, I must say that I don't agree with your suggestions (except perhaps that last one about the con-long "playtest event")<br/>
<br/>
Playtesting with people you don't know is IMPORTANT. It's important for designers to keep us from becoming inbred, assuming that everybody knows what we're talking about, getting a glimpse of how people and their gamer- and human-baggage are going to understand our game. If you have a people who nod knowingly when you say "This aspect of my game is just like Polaris" you're never going to practice explaining your game.<br/>
<br/>
It's important for con-goers so they see that we're not inbred and elitist. It's important that they can come into the fold, and influence a game on the ground floor if they want to. I think listing PLAYTEST in all caps in the event name and event description will be plenty to warn away those who don't want to get their hands dirty, and welcome those who do, will be sufficient. Plus, for Dexcon, maybe I'll get a big red stamp that says PLAYTEST and stamp all the signup sheets on the Big Board.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can have the playtest GMs wear a giant red "P" t-shirt. Hmmm, Kat has a screen printing kit ...<br/>

                            Mike's right. First, clearly label what's what. Second, explain the labels. Have a section that says, "PLAYTEST EVENT: if you decide to play this event, realize that the game is being tested, and may not function well at all. Your help in doing such tests will be appreciated by the designer, however. Yadda yadda."<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea. Basically educate the people who may sign up as much as possible. Some people will love the opportunity to get in on a playtest, and you shouldn't restrict their access to information on them just because they're not normal events. If you have to, put these events in their own section of the programme to make it absolutely clear that they are not "normal" events.<br/>

                            I made certain my game was announced as a playtest. The players I got were all people who had been involved in either Indie round-table discussions about its development in the past or players who already knew me and the game from my descriptions. Announcing it as playtest did exactly what I wanted it to do. It kept the interested people involved.<br><br>Could I have done this outside the con? Certainly. Why did I do this in the con? Sink or swim. I used the con as a solid deadline to have some playable rules ready. Is this the best thing I could have done for the state of gaming and con-goers everywhere? No. If things sucked, I was ready to play an "instant fun" game like octaNe to see them through their slot. Even if the rules were shaky, the premise was strong enough to carry us through the session.<br><br>I saw a similar instance with Snow From Korea, an unscheduled test. We practically made up the endgame mechanic as we played but we were having too much fun to just stop without finding a way to finish our story.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm in a mad rush, so I apologize if I've missed something relevant in later replies in this thread. I've only had time today to skim the first couple posts, and I hope to add more later.<br><br>However, I did want to chime in and remind everyone that the "Preview" stage that Ben is talking about is EXACTLY on target for what Paul Czege and I will be championing with the Ashcan Front. <br><br>We are setting up a 10x10 booth at GenCon, and we are seeking participants with games in that Preview stage. We believe very strongly that taking part in this process will take one's game from "90% fun" to "critical hit." <br><br>We do seek buy-ins for the booth at $100. We are not exactly like Forge booth in that demos will be constant for all participants, all the time. But, I believe we will be hosting demonstrations (likely on a schedule due to the smaller booth space).<br><br>There are two crucial benefits by participating with an ashcan / Preview game. <br><br>First,  you identify your audience. People will emerge whom you very likely had never considered as advocates who become vital for shaping those final touches of the game. It will help you market the game, and help refine the design.<br/><br/>Second, when you do encounter these ideal advocates, you are very likely to receive crucial feedback that pushes your game from that 90% to the critical hit. <br/><br/>Paul and I are putting our money where our mouth is on this, and we hope you will too. Please contact either of us, or stay posted for more details soon.

We want this to become a solid, accepted step on the way to publising a fantastic game.                        </div>

<p>I'm totally with Mike M. I think playtests are good. I think that there are late night pickup games is also great. Marking a game as a Playtest or Preview is a good way to build fans, it's a good way to get really valuable feedback, and it's a good way to show interested players how to make their own. It's real community. It's making our own fun.</p>
<p>I think what was done this year, marking things Playtest, was great. It let me know what was what. I played four finished games and one playtest and they were all fun for their own reasons.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Ashcan Front. You're them men now, dogs.</p>

                            Uhm...I think there's a miscommunication here. I know playtesting is important. I agree that it's great for the designer to get random folks involved and providing feedback. I'd love for more people to want to get into it. All that's cool, but what does it give the con?<br/><br/>Running a game at a con is getting a benefit for providing a service. Mutual benefit on both sides...great. On the other hand, running a playtest at a con is getting a benefit for getting a benefit. It's a great deal for the guy running the playtest, but not so much for the convention organizers.<br/><br/>Look at it from this point of view. You organize a con. You make your living from it. It's fun, but it's a lot of work and effort. To make the con work, you provide GMs with free attendance when they provide a certain amount of entertainment to a certain number of paying customers. <br/><br/>Now you've got a guy who wants to run a session or two using a game they're still working on. His friends and fellow game designers show up and play. Maybe one or two regular paying customers also show. So now you've given a reward to someone who's already getting the benefit of free assistance in developing his game. This is clearly not helping you as much as providing the same reward to GMs who simply run events meant to provide entertainment to attendees.<br/><br/>That's what I'm saying -- filling up the schedule with playtests is great for the designer, but not for the convention.                        </div>

                            Well, I'll disagree right back, man. I think what gets <i>most </i>people to cons is the chance to play fun games, as well as to interact with others who share their interests. Sure, <i>some </i>people will be attracted to the design side of it, but the vast majority just want entertainment. <br/><br/>I think the "indie spirit" you mention is really the idea that there are all these cool games you can <i>play</i>, not that there are all these potentially cool games you can <i>help design</i>.<br/><br/>I mean, do you honestly think that even 10 playtest sessions generate as much interest and fun for the average attendee as 5 gaming sessions? For you or me, sure, those playtests may be awesome sources of ideas and a way we can feel like we are giving back to the design community we belong to. For Joe Random Gamer? Almost certainly not.                        </div>

                            As long as people also bring real games to run and when they do a playtest, they clearly label it as such in the game's blurb, what's the problem?<br/><br/>If all there was being offered by our community was playtests, I'd be bummed but I believe most of the people who ran playtests also ran at least a session of a finished game along with it.                        </div>

                            Andrew, I suppose we're simply on different sides of the fence. <i>I don't presume to know what Joe Gamer wants at a convention.</i> I think it's best to give him as many choices as we can manage, and let Joe Gamer decide for himself.<br/>
<br/>
But I also think Judd's hit the mark in keeping playtest events to a minority of the games we offer. We don't want to seem that we're there just to squeeze playtesting out of people. Because, frankly, we're not.                        </div>

                            Another quick idea is that playing games acts as advertising. You see there's a game of Best Friends scheduled and, later, when you're at the stall, you see Best Friends and you think "I've heard of that". It's wise to use that advantage, as much as you can, to support games which are actually on sale.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></div>

                            I think that having a separate track for pre-published games (at whatever level) is good.  So as a companion to the Indie Games Explosion, you might have the Indie Playtest Explosion (or something less-lamely-named).<br/><br/>I think distinguishing within that track between notional/gestating games and on-the-cusp-of-publication games is an excellent idea.<br/><br/>I think that in the meantime, putting "playtest" in the title of your game is to the good.  Also whoever's organizing the IGE might want to recommend a little 2-sentence script (I can see the wincing and hear the howls of scorn) to say at the start of your game so that people know what they're getting into.                        </div>

                            I think that a convention has to consider any event it runs in terms of the benefits it might bring to the convention. In fact, not just games are offered. I mean, OK, William Shattner is brought out to sign autographs. And he's paid to do it. So that's a benefit to him, and he gets in free, so that's a benefit to him.<br/>
<br/>
What does the con get from it? The fact that people will want to come to see him.<br/>
<br/>
That's the only question that has to be answered in terms of what the con gets. It's not important how much the designer gets, it's not about some fair trade. It's mutual benefit. The only question is whether or not having William Shattner or a playtest as additional events as part of the overall schedule will attract more attendees. That's the bottom line.<br/>
<br/>
And, in fact, I think playtests will draw more attendees as part of the overall package. Heck, I think you could have a "playtest con" where you ran nothing but playtests, and draw some folks. Not as many as to a normal con, no. But as a component of a larger schedule? I think it's a good synergy, an addition of yet another product that the convention has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the proof is in the pudding. Do people sit down to play playtests? Do they say that they feel that they're more likely to attend a covention that has Games + Playtests vs Games only? That's the only consideration. And I think Games + Playtests is a plus.<br/>
<br/>
Put this another way - you seem to believe that if these designers did not run their playtests that they would have run something else instead. But there's really no evidence for that, is there? Some may have come, in fact, solely based on the notion that they were going to run playtests, and would not have otherwise come.<br/>
<br/>
So it's a value add for the con, I think. Especially becuse these people, for the most part, did, in fact, run other non-playtest games.<br/>

                            Mike (Holmes), I think I agree with most of what you're saying. I think that the benefit provided to the con is certainly the most important factor, though not the only factor. The problem here is that everyone (myself included) is working without any real data. At this point, I think we've done the issue to death. We could go back and forth trying to convince each other that our gut impressions are correct, but that doesn't really accomplish anything.<br><br>The separate, convention-long playtest event seems to be acceptable to everyone, anyway, so why don't we spend more time discussing that and other possible ways to handle playtesting for, say, DexCon?                        </br></br></div>

                            I asked Vinnie, the Double Exposure head honcho, about this.  Here's his take:<br/><br/>"I think that one of the biggest strengths of a convention is that it  HAS the atmosphere to support a playtest - as long as that is made  clear in the description of the event. There are many congoers who  are always looking for the "next big thing" and love taking part in  the shaping of the product.<br/><br/>I think that any discussion which focuses on the "overall convention  experience" misses the fact that in a given segment of say, 200  potential role players for a large convention, at least 10 of them  are going to seek out playtests and games that still in development.  Therefore, putting them into the schedule makes perfect sense to me,  and I might even consider highlighting them for DEXCON."                        </div>

                            Jason, thanks for doing that.<br/><br/>Erm....I'm planning to organize something along the lines of the "Playtest Event" game slots I outlined above at DexCon, with an eye to seeing how well it works. If someone wants to organze something <i>else</i> in addition, we should probably talk in order to see how we can try to "test run" all of our ideas without stepping on each others toes. I mean, once we get closer to the event and people have a better idea of what they're doing, of course.                        </div>

                            Definitely everyone comes to a con looking for different things. I always take the opportunity to play something I've never played before or run something I've never run before with people I've never met before. It's the high wire act of gaming. I'd sign up for a playtest game and be patient with the person organizing it, even given my extremely rigorous ideas of playtesting.                        </div>

                            Just as an aside, how many playtests involved "general populace" attendees at Dreamation? All the players in the two games I tested were at the Indie roundtable. Is it a concern if the dev community (who are acquainted personally with the trials and tribulations of a playtest) are the only ones in on these tests?                        </div>

                            My playtesting isn't as difficult since the two things I've had to playtest are based on two systems that work and work damned well (Sorcerer and TSoY) but still, there were fiddly bits that I wanted to see work and scenarios and PC's that I'd like to include in the book for others to use.<br/><br/>When I ran 1st Quest this past Dreamation, I was lucky to have Thor and Mayuran, who I know will tell me if something sucks and have played TSoY quite a bit (hell, Thor taught me how to use keys to make good con scenarios) and three other awesome gentlemen who I have gamed with at past cons but who hadn't seen the game so I had to explain everything.<br/><br/>Both are really, really valuable.                        </div>

Dude, that was Steve, right? He's one of the coolest people around, and probably brings more to the gaming table than anyone I've ever met. I should email him and see what his take on playing a playtest was like.                        </div>
