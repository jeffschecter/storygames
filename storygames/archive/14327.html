Sacred cows need to go, there are so many false assumptions...<br/><br/>The last time we did it I had a stack of index cards with interesting locations and encounters all sketched out and stated up and when the party advanced I drew one at random. The rest was improv. It worked pretty well. It didn't make any kind of sense, but that's the kind of game we were playing and it was fun: One second you're stealing a gem from the temple-fortress of the snake-men, the next you're fighting a pair of humpty-dumpties with sonic attacks. <br/><br/>It was full gonzo. I have trouble imagining a fully random game that wasn't wacky.You'd have to severely weigh or rewrite a lot of your tables so that the results will always make <i>some</i> kind of sense.

I think it kept going for, hmmm, 6 or 8 months or so.<br/><br/>I think the main thing I learned, in terms of what didn't work, was a lesson like:  Be prepared for your players to do anything, but expect them to do nothing.<br/><br/>It's going to be group-specific, of course.  To pick an obvious example, I thought I was being a nice guy by letting my players draft up a wish list of magic items.  Hahaha, no.  I think I got one player to buy in.  It's not a problem per se, as long as you have some sort of fallback system (which, eventually, I did.)<br/><br/>Same thing with player input at the table.  Sometimes they'll get a fire in their belly about a particular direction, but more often than not they kind of waffled around about just what adventure to tackle.  So I gave them a nudge.  It all worked out.<br/><br/><br/>In terms of encounter generation, I had a folder of, hmmm, about two dozen monsters printed out with their stat blocks, and a rough idea of what opposition they'd be facing in a certain direction.

I've continued to like the idea though, of using a river as an avenue of exploration into an otherwise cost-prohibitive unknown area. Just this past week, I've challenged myself to create some die-drop tables since it's a thing I haven't done much and my third one ended up crossing these two streams. I thought I'd share what I did here.<br><br>First, an example of some quick generation (the first paragraph is my premise and each one thereafter is a hex generated on my die-drop table):<br>_____<br>A mighty river empties into the sea in the newly discovered dark continent and the party, having decided that boating upriver will be too slow has set out to follow it upstream.<br><br>A vast oaky scrub extends out on the north of the river giving off a sense of doom and foreboding. South is dominated by a 480 acre bog and stands of very dense woods. Giant toads and vicious feral dogs run wild.<br/><br/>A tight curve in the river bounds a large stand of sparse woods, the floor of which is populated by a colony of giant centipedes. The north/east continues to be dominated by creepy oaken scrub-land in which a knowledgeable, crag-faced hermit who speaks no tongue known to civilization lives.<br/><br/>The river through this hex is uncannily straight, paralleling the not too distant coast but separated by high ground. On the east a moderately small 180 acre bog lies between the main river and a quite-substantial tributary that joins from the east. The bog is home to another colony of giant toads, quite similar to the ones seen earlier.<br/><br/>As the river curves to the southeast, the southwest bank is dominated by great ovals of oft-flooded mudflats separated by very dense stands of woods. Black bear feed on fish during the floods and berries at the margin of the woody areas. The opposite bank is blanketed by a dense forest packed with underbrush that halves the speed of anyone traveling overland through it.<br/><br/>In this hex, the river continues to curve toward the east though there are numerous perturbations and local curves in its course. As the river descends through this hex, it loses 100 feet of elevation over half a mile of very severe rapids and small cataracts. The land north of the river is again dominated by scrub-land with huge gnarled oaks that are host to Spider Birds -- mouse-sized avians with poisonous talons who spin large colonial nests of web.\ufeff<br/>_____<br/>And here's a download link to the tool I made and used:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17qeHCBScJMmusV4o2kx_mtfte9T1dyitLsdSjltsUL8/pub?w=1440&amp;h=1080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17qeHCBScJMmusV4o2kx_mtfte9T1dyitLsdSjltsUL8/pub?w=1440&amp;h=1080</a><br/><br/>It was fun! And I think it's a pretty good amount of info coming out of three dice -- enough to run with. I'm speculating, but I fear it will get repetitive if used a great deal. It's at least a risk.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448870/#Comment_448870" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-02T20:21:50+00:00" title="October  2, 2015  8:21PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much all of my late campaigns have been somewhat randomized, so here are my two cents:<br/><br/>How did it go?<br/>It was better when the randomization was focused around something, like a theme, a player-defined quest or just the overall arch established as simply as "X enemy plagues the land and you all adventurers have a reason to go up against it". Also, it was best to use the randomization only for the first part, until players defined their goals and made enough actions to define important consequences upon the setting. <br/><br/>By then you only would need to randomize a few new places as needed and maybe some random encounters, but otherwise, using the consequences (like that orc who escaped two sessions ago, bringing reinforcements to hunt the PCs, or a town where they stole something hiring a band of mercs to get their things back.)<br/><br/>Wacky or non?<br/>Whenever you keep the randomization going it definitely went wacky, but as someone wrote above, it soon makes sense by itself. Though, by then it would probably become anime-like or even alice in wonderland-alike. Maybe even weirder.<br/><br/>If you keep impro going with the less amount of random possible and keeping logic in mind, it can even pass as a well written story.<br/><br/>Are you strictly Old School or is there some System Matters stuff mixed in there?<br/>Hmmm, well, for some things it was Old School, for others System matters and for others it was the GM relying on the players. Once my players fought a hard battle, so I let them decide what did each of them found as treasure. I was surprised none choose anything that could be a potential setting-breaker.<br/><br/>You can even have players give sense to anything and make the scene detective-like. Once players had learned some clues to whatever was happening around them (often even I didn't have an idea, at other times, I wanted to hear what they were thinking.) I made them roll intelligence. The one rolling lowest could then make up anything as an explanation. In ascending order, the rest of the players corrected the ones who had talked before, until the last one finally finds the exact truth. Then it was easier for them to come up with their next goal.<br/><br/>As for randomization tools, here's the <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">Resourcefull Deck</a> I made some time ago. I still have to upgrade it, I want to make it simpler and add the dungeon generator I'm currently using.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448871/#Comment_448871" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-03T02:57:12+00:00" title="October  3, 2015  2:57AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2015 3:02AM by kurisu.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few months ago I had strep throat. One of the days that I took off work, I downloaded Mad Monks of Kwantoom and rolled up a monk for some solo gaming. I barely survived my first day (of shopping) in Kwantoom--the first hole-in-the-wall I stumbled into contained a nest of spitting cobras. Fortunately, I won initiative and ran for it. After arming myself with a tetsubo and a few other sundries, I took the ferry over to the isle of the 1000 Pagodas and entered a random pagoda. The first room contained a bunch of laquered furniture and two hobgoblins armed with naginatas. Sweet! I charged across the room and jump-kicked one of the hobgoblins. Then they cut me to pieces with their pole-arms. Such was the short career of Layman Pang. Or whatever his name was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449074/#Comment_449074" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-18T15:07:11+00:00" title="October 18, 2015  3:07PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used the Dungeon Dice mentioned above to create a random Goblin Caves dungeon on the fly in a recent DW game, combined with some alphabet dice and an OSR "Dungeon ABCs" book. It worked pretty well, and in fact I'd recommend it as a good zero-prep way of doing business. The thing I need to get better at is varying the monster and dungeon moves to keep it interesting, rather than just hitting them with damage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
