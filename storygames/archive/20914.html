Then we narrated scenes which, one by one, demonstrated that the facts established in the setup were all false -- that they were surface appearances (believed by, say, 95% of people) but not how things actually were. As you might expect, attempting to negate 100% of the setup facts resulted in a pretty convoluted story; not all the players were up for the degree of mental gymnastics it required. (Part of the issue here was that we played with 6 people, so there were 18 facts to negate.) Personally I thought it was great.<br/><br/>I've been thinking that softening the 'negate everything' mechanic or mixing it lightly in to another game would be a good idea, and eventually I came up with the following.<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/103301968400189043300/posts/a362Dyh4vf8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/103301968400189043300/posts/a362Dyh4vf8</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458939/#Comment_458939" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-31T18:12:21+00:00" title="December 31, 2016  6:12PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite interesting! I will get back to this later. I've done some thinking about "inverting" world-building this way; I think there may be some promising techniques there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
