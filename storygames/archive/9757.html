I ran one session of it. It was rad but alas, it ran into the problem of "THIS IS PRETTY MUCH OUR LIVES W/ MAGIC."<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<u>Scott Pilgrim: The Flipin' Sweet Game</u>[/align]<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Introduction</u><br/>\nSo, like, I had like ten million ideas and problems with my super sweet sci-fi velocity bio-opera; my head could barely stay on it's shoulders. Then, I was like anthro-arcano-funk? Also, less problems, probably more awesome but still kinda like a head ache. Then I was reading the ComicCon issue of Scott Pilgrim and I was like man, this is awesome. Soda pop gives you sweet stat bonuses! Aluminum Bat (+2 vs. Girls!) Sixteen year old ninja assassins that drop coupons! Fuck all that we're going to game being sixteen-to-twenty-somethings with kinda sweet powers but a little blas\xe9 about it like some bad NES RPG!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a totally cool feeling about this!<br/>\n<br/>\nCHARACTERS<br/>\nI'm thinking like eight stats (for flavour) something like this:<br/>\nSTRENGH<br/>\nSPEED<br/>\nGUTS<br/>\nSMARTS<br/>\nHEART<br/>\nCHARISMA<br/>\nWILL<br/>\nLUCK<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich would all like be from 1-20 like D&amp;D; style (cause 1-100 is kinda anal) and for starters you'd have like 80 or so points to spend on them. Skills would be sorta Do-It-Yourself and you'd get a similar number of points to spend on them and they couldn't be higher than the stat associated with them. So it'd be like SMARTS 15 \u2013 Finished College 7 or Heart 12  \u2013 Smarmy 9 or Speed 7 \u2013 (Weirdly a) Good Dancer 6 or whatever. Um. You'll have HP and MP (Health and Magic Points respectively but don't hassle me about it just yet.) And it'd be kinda like Unknown Armies but like hipper and less creepy; sorta like D&amp;D; mixed in there for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd all be like young people who are close to broke working lame jobs but you're all in a kinda cool band (or at least are kinda friends anyways) that plays at the cool bars in town sometimes; in a city that's kinda like my glossy memories of Vancouver and Burnaby or whatever I want to make up. And you all hangout and fight ninja ex-girlfriends and rival hipster gangs, because you're young and need the XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that there'll be levels and classes (again like one-to-twenty but lets not get ahead of ourselves here) but mostly stuff will be point buy (more like point bribe) via XP. The classes will either be transcendental archetypes like HEALER or WIZARD or NINJA, or something DIY like HIPSTER or STUDENT or VEGAN. I think that you'd get some kinda awesome power related to per level, like HIPSTER lvl  1 would like FASHION SENSE, and then like at lvl 9 like LETHAL IRONY. So the first few ones would be kinda cool tricks that everyone who\u2019s even starting that class would know, but as you get higher up you start getting serious business powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I'm think starting characters would have like four or five cool things about them to help flesh them out like a not totally sucky job or a car that runs on self-esteem, or an Aluminum Bat (+2 VS GIRLS). I guess like perks, something that's not a power per se but that's kinda useful. If it's really awesome it might cost two or more of your perks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther stuff that I was thinking about: mostly, I want the system to reflect the almost nonsensical logic of early Nintendo RPGs, so like when you KO some one, they're not dead but defeated (kinda just turn into blue light or something) and GP and maybe magic items. Or like how much you can carry has nothing to with weight or volume but how many open slots you have in your inventory. Or that you can be smoked in the head with a bat and only take 1D6 DMG to your HP. And MAGIC and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I want it to mesh thematically with the Scott Pilgrim comic universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSample Test Character of my friend Stephen!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephen Edward Butler // LVL: 1 HIPSTER // AGE: 22<br/>\nStrength \u2013 14\tGuts \u2013 15\tSmarts \u2013 12\tWill \u2013 8<br/>\nSpeed \u2013 15\tHeart \u2013 14\tCharisma \u2013 12\tLuck \u2013 6<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 28\t MP: 18\tINIT: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nJOB: (sucky) coffee shop<br/>\nRENT: (shitty) sketchy apt w/ one roommate (Me!)<br/>\nGP: Eh.

Scott Pilgrim needs, like, 8 traits a character, period.  Also, thanks to Vol 4, we already know that Scott Pilgrim has only 4 stats (guts, heart, smarts, will).<br><br>I wrote a Scott Pilgrim hack for Primetime Adventures a while back.  It looked like this:<br><br><b>Volumes</b><br><br>Pick a number of Volumes you're going to play out.  The real <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> has 7 (or actually 6), but that may be too many, if you want something focused, or two few, if you'd rather do something as involved as <i>Ranma 1/2</i>.<br><br><b>Characters</b><br><br>Your series will be centered around a main protagonist who we'll call "Scott," even though they can be called anything you want in your game.  All the other PCs must be connected to Scott in some way, but it doesn't have to be directly.  If one player is Scott's gay brother Jimmy, an art school student, another player can play Jimmy's middle school boyfriend/rival, Howard, a record store clerk.  If it's not obvious already, all the characters should be hipsters or other jaded cool-losers between 15-30.<br><br>Character names are always ridiculous.  I'm not sure how to describe the right kind of ridiculous.  Remember this is a hipster power fantasy and I think you'll do fine.  A banal or classic-but-unusual first name followed by something that's not really a last name is a good call.  If they sound a bit like bad James Bond characters, you know you've nailed it.  Edward Gunslinger.  Ginger Soir\xe9e.  Rick Adroit.  Meredith Flagship.<br><br><b>The Premise</b><br><br>The premise of your game should fit the following format:\n<ul><br>[PROTAGONIST] must [DRAMATIC VERB] [A PC]'s [NUMBER OF VOLUMES] [MALEVOLENT GENRE FICTION COMICS TRAIT] [BANAL AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL INTROSPECTIVE SAD HIPSTER COMICS STAPLE]<br/></br></ul>\nFor example, in the real <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> series, the premise is:\n<ul><br>Scott must defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends.<br/></br></ul>\nBut in your series, <i>Alicia Excelsior</i>, the premise might be:\n<ul><br>Alicia must exorcise Robert's 18 demonic step-fathers.<br/></br></ul>\n<b>Scott</b><br><br>Scott is always the Spotlight Character of any particular Volume, but he does not have a potency of 3 like normal.  Instead, Scott as 0 potency and is effective in conflicts thanks solely to Fanmail, either Fanmail he earns or Fanmail that is spent on his behalf.<br><br><b>That's It!</b><br><br>Play and be merry!  The rest of <i>PTA</i> should work pretty well just as it is.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216526/#Comment_216526" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T14:04:59+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  2:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the stats thing I got from the GenCon issue where it lists all the bonus to stats and the mechanics are just Unknown Armies with the serials filled off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe particular group I ran it for were all DnD and/or Shadowrun and/or Rifts players exclusively so I needed something with less drity-hippy and all little more crunchy crunch. Additionally, I wanted to give it the feel of an old NES rpg, where the fiddly mechanics and video game logic show up in the narrative and the characters are self-conscious about it. The character live in a world where if you don't take the skateboarding feat, you can't ride skateboards. A lot of the charm of the comics is that Scott's world is seen through old video game tinted glasses, which is where a lot of the humour come from, for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216723/#Comment_216723" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:28:34+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:28PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ohh, man, someone should forward this thread to Brian Lee O'Malley.

And I'd probably want to wait until after the series ends in Vol 6 too.  I also think that Luke was a great guy to do Mouse Guard because he wasn't a drooling fanboy of the series (since fanboyness can make it hard to approach the source material with a clear head), so I'd need a snappy looking business plan too, not just like "Hey Mal, here's my sweaty handshake," which he probably gets enough of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
