The idea is that each character has access to a one-time use Covert Action that reflects contacts, spy experience, and networks of intelligence operatives.  These would be less role-played out in detail and more narrative meta-actions to shake things up.  Here are some of the Cover Actions that I came up with<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Covert Actions</span></b>\n<ol>\n<li>Find out one PC\u2019s Hidden Agenda (National)</li>\n<li>Obtain blackmail on one PC</li>\n<li>Decline starting Hidden Agenda (National) and receive alternative (perhaps with an NPC operative sent to carry out the original agenda)</li>\n<li>Eavesdrop on another PC's Covert Action request (but not the answer)</li>\n<li>Have single NPC assassinated</li>\n<li>Delay a PC through bureacratic or covert means (hold them up for the first part of scene or maybe removed all together)</li>\n<li>Plant false Hidden Agenda (would only be useful against <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above)</li>\n</ol>\nFeedback?  Thoughts?<br/>My main concerns are that it will be too much for a new player to juggle when combined with the Hidden Agendas or that it will pull the focus of the game too much away from the main plot and more into inter-team conflict (which is the point I suppose).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298811/#Comment_298811" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T00:14:50+00:00" title="October 30, 2010 12:14AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The important question here must be, why? I can see that in a con game it becomes neccessary to fit more into less time to give the players a chance to really get to grips with the game, but why have these covert actions? What do think they will add to the game? What outcome would you like to obtain through using them?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the examples are things that could also be done through conflicts; in fact, most of them are very powerful, almost killer moves, and it seems a shame to deny the target any chance to defend against them, when conflicts are what makes the game run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
