                            Big Names are people who point at when they are talking about how they play.  Ron Edwards is *the* prime example - on RPGnet at least -  people line up either for or against him as much as the Forge, though many of them seem hesitant to say the name until you piss them off.<br/>
<br/>
One True Ways are methods of roleplaying that people tout as 'the right way' or 'the better way'.  Even I'm guilty here.<br/>
<br/>
These may be internal terms in my head, but I see them as real.  I even see myself subscribing to them as bases of thought sometimes, and I hate it.                        </div>

                            Seriously, how can we expect not to? It's a behavior that is very common in a lot of fields, and the reasons for it run thick in the RPG community.  Designers and writers are genuinely enthusiastic about their position, and it's easy for that to come off as overzealous. There are always going to be people who view designers as rock stars.  Always always always.  Similarly, there are always going to be designers who buy into their own legend.  There's no way to get around it.<br/>
<br/>
It is exacerbated in corners of the community where the rough model of things is an academic one because well, anyone who's dealt with academia may have a sense that as far as big names and one true way-ism goes, RPGs end up looking pretty good by comparison. :)<br/>
<br/>
It's really easy to point fingers at the big names for hubris, or at those pointing fingers for attacking the person, but the trick of it is that either of these behaviors just help perpetuate the model.  A lot of the churnfighting you see is of this type.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is "What do you do about it?"  Ideally, it's good to say the emperor has no clothes, but practically speaking, the child that did that was stoned to death and the rest of the kingdom quickly got naked.  Telling people to change, or chastising them for it is likely to get you nowhere.  Just keeping it in mind is when you talk may be the best you can do.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing communities wisely helps too.  One of the reasons I'm still enjoying it storygames is that while it's clear some people still follow the BN/1TW model, it feels much less institutionalized here, which fills me with hope. :)<br/>

                            What Rob said about academia.  The RPG community is a velvet glove lawn bowling soiree in comparison.  I agree that those behaviors are not universally correctable, but as an individual you definitely have a choice.                        </div>

                            Basically riffing off of Rob's comments.  Writers and game designers are, as a general rule, able to communicate well in text.  Many of them are also charismatic and talented.  Put that together, and it's easy to gather a following (or, in same cases, an anti-following).  Similarly, if someone latches onto a style of gaming that really appeals to them, they want to convert others to that same style.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is a fair bit is "counter 1TWs."  Ron Edwards would be an example of this as well: people who don't agree with so-called "Forge Design" start to turn their own ways of thinking into a different 1TW to combat it, and sometimes for no other reason than they don't like Ron.  Another example is that many indie designs are actually direct revolts against some aspect of "the way things are always done."  I personally think this is a good and healthy thing, but when it moves to personal attacks, though (which it seems to do more often than I would like), it's gone too far.<br/><br/>I am unabashedly old school in my designs, but the work of the past five or so years in RPG design has really influenced my own work.  I think everyone should take in as much theory as they need to or desire, and then just follow their instincts as a designer.  Of course, that's also a One True Way.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Absolutely.  I parrot Rob, Jason and Eddy above. <br/><br/>I'll add some witicisms and noticed behaviors:<br/><code>Big Names are people who point at when they are talking about how they play. Ron Edwards is *the* prime example - on RPGnet at least - people line up either for or against him as much as the Forge...</code><br/>Yeah. Ron Edwards is the new John Wick. Were you on RPGNet at any time from 2000-2002? No one there really knew or paid attention to Ron (usually because Ron was too busy doing his own thing, and the seeds being sown by various groups hadn't sprouted yet), but "The Wick" was talked about constantly. People would dig up lines and paragraphs that he would say on the internet or in some journal and crucify him for it. The other half of the people defended his works (either because they were peers, or because those screaming monkey crucifiers were just being a little too rough with their treatment and wanted to give him a fair shake). The THIRD half (heh) didn't give a shit either way.<br/><br/>Sure, John made some great stuff. He said some great stuff. He said some dumb stuff. But because he was a slightly shinier star at the time, a lot of folks related to their hobby through the stuff he said or wrote.<br/><br/>John stops making mainstream stuff, and starts doing his own thing. Nifty. He's not as much as a shining star, and for whatever reason, people latched on to Ron to push him into the gap that John filled, attacking or revereing him as they did The Wick.<br/><br/>Not to paint this picture of persecution or whatever: For every motherfucker with an axe to grind who says some hateful, hateful shit about Ron or whomever... Well, there'll be that person who will pop into a thread on discussion and eagerly and ernestly informs people, "Well, Ron Edwards says X on this issue" and all us friends or of Ron go, "Er... yeah... but dude, he's just a <i>guy</i>, man, don't get too caught up on what he said".<br/><br/>In two or three years, someone else will take his place as the reviled and/or worshipped guy, the new shining star.  I'm thinking it's going to be Vincent, but unfortunately he is extremely, <i>extremely</i> hard to revile, he's just too fucking nice.                        </div>

<b>One True Way</b><br/><br/><code>One True Ways are methods of roleplaying that people tout as 'the right way' or 'the better way'. Even I'm guilty here.</code><br/><br/>I hope folks don't mind if I put words in our mouths, but if what I'm saying is outside of your experience, please chime in.<br/><br/>I think that most of us do not think that there is "one true way" to play. Or that "Narrativism is BETTER than Gamism/Simulationism"etc.  It can be "more fun for me", but not better. I really think most of us believe this.<br/><br/>However, I also think most of us believe, "It is Better to reflectively look at your hobby than to just take it at face value". Better with a Capital "Objectively/One True Way" Better.  <br/><br/>Result: If someone takes their hobby at face value, never trying something new (and that is the D&amp;D player who refuses to play games with no GM, as well as the drama queen who refuses to play any game with a tactical combat system, as well as all the people on both sides who never seem to look up to see the mass of interesting games that surround them"), we believe that these folks are Worse than people who try other games and modes of play.  Even if they give them a try, and decide it's not for them:<br/><br/><b>Gamer who says "I tried some other games, but they just weren't for me" &gt; Gamer who refuses to play other games. </b> <br/>Pretty much the same for any aspect of any hobby, not just games.<br/><br/>That's about as One True Wayism that I think most of us get. If we act all snarky about the masses playing D&amp;D at the Con, it's not really because they're simply playing D&amp;D, it's because we're mistakenly lumping the mass of folks who are afraid to play other games with the mass of folks who have played other games and found that they like D&amp;D the best.<br/><br/>"What the fuck? It's just a <i>hobby</i>, you should just have fun. And leave those who are having their unreflective fun alone." &lt;--- This is a valid criticism of the above belief.  However, most of us here would have left the hobby a long time ago if we hadn't ourselves engaged in some reflection about our hobby.  Even if it's like Eddy (or me, for that matter) who tried various games, and realize that they like the traditional stuff the most.                        </div>

                            All right, it's time to say my piece about this.<br/>
<br/>
<b>I do not, and have never, advocated any One True Way of role-playing.</b><br/>
<br/>
Levi, I have no idea where you have acquired this judgment of my writings and postings. I am the person who did not originate, but has introduced and supported the entire idea of valid different ways to play to the role-playing community.<br/>
<br/>
That's what Creative Agenda is about. That's what the Big Model is about. That's what Forge-supported design is about - writing <i>your</i> game, publishing it, and if you'd like, profiting from it. Not someone else's.<br/>
<br/>
One more time: associating me with the concept of "One True Way" is in error. One more time: my track record in this regard exceeds anyone's currently active in role-playing.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the hard part. Obviously I do not think that "any way works" and "any way can be fun" and "any role-playing is all good because anyone can enjoy anything," or any other such fluffy bullshit. However, in internet-land, when I state that there are <i>problems</i> out there, manifested in real-people pain and real-people crises, and in real-people losses of time and money, this gets interpreted that I <i>must</i> be advocating some One True Way. Or when I talk about the limitations and pitfalls inherent to any particular approach to play, then I'm interpreted as saying it is low-grade or inferior.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck that stupid noise. Those problems are real. Those features are real. But there isn't a One True Way.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think people ought to consider that (a) having a preference and helping people to understand it, and (b) identifying blatant failures of "fun" are not One True Way either.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I stand by my "brain damage" comments. Yet if anyone claims I'm stating "play differently! play my way! save yourselves!", then they are exhibiting poor thinking and reading. Levi, this is for you: I am appalled at your failure actually to email me and ask what I mean. No. You think you <i>know</i>, which is that I must hate you and think you're "playing wrong." You are mistaken. Stop blaming me for your reactions, stop acting like a virgin in a story who's had her ass groped, and start learning, if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, take Vincent, who gets this same muddy-think treatment on his blog. He wants to talk about thematic play (Narrativism as I define it) there. He simply doesn't <i>want</i> to talk about other kinds. Yet this is interpreted as One True Wayism? Blanket judgment on any other way to play, because he doesn't <i>want</i> to spend time on it at his blog? More bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Me. One True Way. Two different things. Not the same. Vincent. One True Way. Two different things. Not the same.<br/>
<br/>
Andy, I've got my own beef with you regarding your John Wick comparison and your whole "awww, guys, he didn't <i>mean</i> it like he <i>said</i>" talk. Contact me privately about that.<br/>

<p><em>"Levi, I have no idea where you have acquired this judgment of my writings and postings."</em></p>
<p>Hang on, there, Ron.</p>
<p>In actuality, when the whole One True Way thing comes up, I'm not pointing at you.  Or Vincent.</p>
<p>Usually, I'm pointing at a small group of posters, mostly on RPGnet that have occasionally waved your name around as if you had given them some mandate to tell others why what they do is wrong.</p>
<p>That <em>is</em> the public.</p>
<p>My issue with you is entirely seperate...</p>
<p><em>"Stop blaming me for your reactions, stop acting like a virgin in a story who's had her ass groped, and start learning, if you're interested."</em></p>
<p>My issue with you is the phrasing you use when you're being casual and rough.  You can wave that off as much as you like, I don't have any right to tell you how to talk, and I <em>will</em> try to look for what you're saying in what you say.</p>
<p>My considered opinion is, was, and remains that how you say something is just as important as what you're saying.  What you're saying, after consideration, I almost always agree with at least part of.  But I don't always see what you're saying because of the tone.</p>
<p>Simple as that.  If you'd like me to contact you privately about that, I'll do that.</p>

<code>Levi, I have no idea where you have acquired this judgment of my writings and postings. </code><br><br>Actually, Ron... well, Levi said it before but I'll second: Basically, on RPGNet, Levi has been recently doing what Tony_LB is doing, and what Paka did before: Getting folks interested in being reflective about gaming, introducing Theory, etc.<br><br>Tony and Paka are used to the usual suspects showing up into the thread and taking a big steaming shit on the Forge, you, etc.  Usually they can talk around it, ignore it, etc.<br><br>Levi's finally getting frustrated because in his own disussions, and other discussions that don't even mention the Forge, the same folks are jumping in and taking big steaming shits for all to see, citing "axe to grind", "agenda", "ivory tower" and the like. He's not voicing anything about you ('side from the "casual and rough" stuff, which I'll let him work out), but voicing what others were saying about you.<br><br>Ex: Some guys, who consistently jump into threads on GNS and the like, and who have been paraphrasing your brain damage comments into (his words) "Ron thinks all gamers who don't follow him are pathetic." (I mean, they actually <i>say this</i>). Levi is not saying this. Levi is trying to find out why these guys feel the need to come out and say these things at every opportunity.

                            Andy's got half of it, at least.<br>
<br>
There have also been people there that I *haven't* seen on the Forge, that feel this bizarre need to defend Forge statements as gospel - not as smart thinking, not as tools, not as a body of learning, but as if they were the be-all and end-all of RPG thought.  They're actually pretty rare, but they make my teeth hurt.<br>
<br>
People drawing up lines based on shit that *nobody actually said*.  That pisses me off more than I can easily express.<br>
<br>
My actual issue with Ron pales by comparison; though I will admit to a "HOLY SHIT" moment the first time I met it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            See guys, I'm getting a big mixed message.<br/>
<br/>
1. Levi, that's fine. However, it makes far more sense for you actually to identify the people you're speaking of to avoid exactly the confusion that's going on. I am not advocating a One True Way. By identifying me, which you have done, and not those who you are really talking about, you associate me with that claim.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't care what is or isn't claimed "I say" in fully public venues like RPG.net, as long as it's not slanderous (and when it has been, I've protested, successfully). By contrast, I do care about statements describing my work in Andy's playground.<br/>
<br/>
You brought me up as directly involved. I am clarifying my view on the issue you want to discuss here. If the topic really is "those others," then I prefer at least to see <i>my</i> position represented correctly, at least to start. I've done so now.<br/>
<br/>
2. Andy, I cannot understand this stuff about how what I say is one thing and what I'm like is another. They are the same. I do not adopt an internet persona. That is me.<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to educate me about the history. I have been following all of the relevant threads at sites &amp; blogs, and I think Levi is doing a brave and useful thing. But this current situation is crap.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because Levi says he's talking about "those guys." You say he's talking about "those guys." And I'm saying, then talk about them. Not me.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm seeing you talk about <i>me</i> here, and I protest, strongly. Not only is it not what Levi wants to talk about, apparently, but it's also drawing me into this bullshit "what I claim" image that I objected to above. In fact, the more you say, "Oh, Ron really is all right after all," the more you support the claim that what I'm saying <i>is</i> messed up in some way.<br/>
<br/>
3. Similarly, or maybe not, Joshua, when you talk about the "Big Name," I can't tell whether you mean my actual presence on-line, typed here and elsewhere, or what "others say." Because if it's the latter, see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above, and if the former, see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That's it. I'm done. My request: leave me <i>out</i> of what you want to discuss (others' behavior relative to my or others' names), because me and my work are totally off the radar of that topic.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Levi, regarding the issue of how something is said, contact me if you wish.                        </div>

<p>So, I'll try.</p>
<p>To shift the debate to more useful terms, and in an attempt to follow the request, I'll skip the other things I want to discuss here, I'll start another thread.</p>
<p>On the topic of phrasing and presentation, I'll think about it - and I'll stop, and think hard if I have anything of genuine <em>use</em> to say there before I do.</p>

                            From my armchair, it looks like Levi is talking about the tendency of people to refer to Big Names (not the people behind those names) as stand-ins for rhetorical positions that they dislike or may not understand.  It's a monkeybrain thing, I think -- it's easier to characterize a person than it is to understand and criticize an argument.  We also like figureheads -- so while the Forge was started by two guys, only one of them gets unfairly characterized as the resident dogma-spouting, dissent-crushing dictator.<br><br>The only thing I can offer to combat it is to not fall into the same trap -- don't say "Vincent says," explain his argument as you understand it.  Attribute it if you like, but make the conversation about the <em>ideas</em>, not the names or the people.  If other people start pointing fingers and trying to drag Big Names into the argument, refuse to engage them on that level.  Suggest they (gasp!) talk to the people behind the Big Names, but focus your effort on the ideas being put forward.  And don't underestimate the flat refusal to engage -- when they rebut your explanation by saying "But Seymour says this-and-such" you can respond, quite eloquently, with "So?" and maybe follow it up with a "I thought I was talking with you."                        </br></br></div>

                            Hnh.  Spiky topic, but I think the more obvious considerations, such a fanboys quoting out of context, may be overshadowing some other problems.<br>
<br>
Here's the thing, if someone says "Lord Wazoo says XYZ!" then I think virtually everyone is well armed to deal with that, either by addressing XYZ, or by questioning the authority of Lord Wazoo.  All well and good.<br>
<br>
The dangerous point becomes when our fanboy seeks to emulate Lord Wazoo, consciously or unconsciously.  Lord Wazoo may argue in a certain fashion or may accept certain premises from which he builds his argument.  When El Fanboy becomes enamored with Lord Wazoo, the concern is not that he will parrot what Lord Wazoo has to say but rather that he will accept the same premises that Lord Wazoo does, and go forth from those.<br>
<br>
Now, this may not always be bad. Presumably Lord Wazoo put a lot of thought into his premises, so they're hopefully not badly formed.  But Adopting them rather than developing them allows from some strange mutations, and worse, when they are challenged, there is no basis except passion to defend them, and that always goes well.  Now, this may seem like I'm attributing some failure on Fanboy's part here, but I'm really not - it is almost frighteningly easy to get drawn into accepting premises if you're happy with the end result.<br>
<br>
So this _can_ lead to tension when fanboy runs into someone who doesn't buy into the premise.  Now, arguments are logical enough, but up until this point, Fanboy has presumably been talking the talk without needing to bring up the Sacred Word of Lord Wazoo because he's bought in, he doesn't need it, so this argument  can go in a lot of ways, most of them bad in some way.  Most often, it is frustrating for both parties because while there may have seemed an initial basis for meaningful communication, it doesn't hold up under stress, and that's a shame.<br>
<br>
Now, obviously, we _do_ have our share of jackass experts and drooling followers, same as any other crowd, but this is a problem that can go a little deeper than that.<br>

Of course it doesn't say one way of gaming is better than another. It's a premise for what makes for good design, not good play.  But it's a premise (or even less generously, an opinion) and maybe it's wrong.<br/>

I really have read this stuff, and I genuinely respect the System Does Matter position, even when I question it.  Hell, I even think it's a robust enough premise that it can take more abuse than what I have to throw at it. :)<br/>
<br/>
-Rob D.<br/>
*EDIT*<br/>
PS - And to clarify - While I would enjoy a debate on the premise of System Does Matter, this is not where I'm going to have it, and so I'm damned well keeping my actual opinion close to my chest except to say that I have one.  I am not attacking the position.  I am questioning that perhaps it is simply that that article has become so ubiquitous a foundation for much discussion that it is very nearly an article of faith.  I have frequently heard said "I think at this point there's no question that System Does Matter" and I twitch every time.  That sounds like 1TW to me, so I toss up a flare.                        </div>

<br/>
I have and it is really difficult to continue a conversation because problems at the table aren't seen as system related.  It can be a difficult go, especially when not accepting that theory flies in the face of my past 3 years of gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I hear ya.<br/>
<br/>
But the wording of that essay couldn't be more gentle about it. <br/>
<br/>
It was a shock to me.  My first lesson of GMing was that the system wasn't that important.  You can imagine my shock when I come to the Forge and first read that essay.  <br/>
<br/>
But my frustrations with the sysems I had been playing had proven other than system doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I know what it is like.  I was what it is like.  It is a difficult thing to swallow, especially since my best gaming had been with hacked together systems that weren't really working, whole sessions getting by on player chemistry and trust.<br/>
<br/>
I hear ya.  Shit, I feel ya.                        </div>

                            Heh.  It's ok, I'm actually in a pretty good place, excepting the communication gap it creates. :)<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I'm feeling that the core response is along the line of "it's not 1TW, it's just _right_".  And Hell, maybe it is - nothing says the one true way isn't actually true (or sufficiently workable for folks that it may as well be).  Heck, given a sufficiently broad definition, my position still probably falls under the SDM umbrella (though i think it would be a sufficiently broad umbrella at that point to create its own problems.<br/>
<br/>
But all that is secondary.    Even if SDM's message had never varied or mutated beyond that initial essay, it is _accepted_.  It's a bedrock truth.  it's One True Way.<br/>
<br/>
And, like some any other things, the next question may well be "Well, so what? It fucking _works_." At that I don't raise any objection, really and truly.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it's useful to look at how people view SDM to provide some context for why an outside viewer might think that there is some inclination towards 1TW-ism.<br/>
<br/>
-Rob D.<br/>
<br/>
PS -- I also completely recognize that the _second_ you say that someone treats their ideas as the 1TW they have every reason to get their hackles up.  That is usually a prelude to an attack, saying that they are ignoring other people or that they have not thought through their position.  To actually step up an say "This is what every experience has taught me, and I accept it to be true, and while I will listen to your arguments, they carry little weight because the truth of this is so _obvious_ to me" is an invitation to disaster in any group where there is not trust that someone's immediately going to be a dick about it.  Because, conversationally, we have little tolerance for articles of faith and belief, it becomes necessary to codify the things we believe with rules or something that sounds more like science, but that leads to fights over the specifics of the structure being created, and that's basically the opposite of communication.<br/>
<br/>
So seriously. I'm comfortable with someone saying that this is the one true way - I can at least speak to that and say "this is where we differ" and then maybe some ground can still be found.  I like it better than the alternatives.                        </div>

I think it does open up conversations to talk about the system and its effect on the table.  Otherwise, any systemic problems can be hand-waved away with a , "feh, system doesn't matter, a good GM and some good players can do anything."<br/>
<br/>
And everyone has been in those great games with systems that were the Ars Magica system and something else cobbled together with spit and glue.  But the group was creating the system through implicit trust and non-verbalized agreements.  Been thar and done that.<br/>

                            I think it's actually pretty clear that System Does Matter isn't a One True Wayism.  <br/><br/>1TW is a judgement call.  An opinion.  It's the belief that there is only one good, proper, or entertaining way to play role playing games, and that all other ways and forms are, in some way, inferior.  The beliefs that real RPGs contain dice and a GM are forms of 1TW.  As is the belief that the only real way to play an RPG is for the GM to provide story for the players and for the players to follow the story.  Similarly, if one were to say that the only good way to play an RPG is GM-less, with shared narrarations, and completely diceless, that would be a 1TW also.<br/><br/>On the other hand, System Does Matter is not an opinion.  It is an observation.  One that can be duplicated and demonstrated.  When a group uses differing systems then differing results in play are inevitable.  <br/><br/>The fallacy of System Doesn't Matter comes from a long-standing tradition of overriding the game text in favor of the established system of the group.  In these instances it's easy to believe that System Doesn't Matter, as it appears that no matter which game text is referanced, the resulting play is the same.  What is being missed in these observations is the fact that the system of the new game text isn't actually being applied at all.  Or, if it is being applied, it's only being applied in the instances where the text does not contradict the established system of the group.  The system that the group has brought with them is dominant.<br/><br/>You could use Capes! to run a Forgotten Realms game.  However, to say that the rules of Capes! could produce the same play experience as D&amp;D can only mean that you're ignoring the rules of one or both systems.  In that case, you're probably using your own habitual system and not the systems in the texts.  D&amp;D, Capes, habits, or other, what system you use to play your RPGs does indeed matter.  <br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>

<br/>
Look at your own word: "what system you use to play your RPGs does indeed matter"; system doesn't matter is a "Fallacy" while System does matter is an "opinion"; if someoen has a differing experience, the definition of system is expanded to include a "habitual system"<br/>
<br/>
I'm at a loss for how this could be more transparent.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, am I wrong thinking that a) You think that it's true and B) that it's a truth more people should accept?  if so, we're most of the way there, and the remaining question is "What do you do when someone says otherwise?"<br/>
<br/>
If the answer includes:<br/>
 * Treating them as if they just don't Get It<br/>
 * Disbelief<br/>
 * Condescension/Patronization<br/>
 * Dismissal<br/>
 * Explanation through repetition<br/>
 * numerous things far more rude and far more obvious<br/>
<br/>
Then you've pretty much made a One True Way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying you, or anyone else in this thread, has done any of these, I feel safe saying this has happened in the past, often enough to merit question.<br/>

                            Sure. I accept that the world is round as truth.  I mock those who think otherwise,   I am resistant to arguments to the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are times in history I might have thought otherwise, and mocked the stupid rounders.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing says the one true way is wrong any more than anything says it's right.  Broken clocks and whatnot. :)<br/>
<br/>
The danger of the One True Way is that it is the end of debate.<br/>
<br/>
For context, look at the response to the idea that maybe some people might treat System Does Matter as a bedrock principle and might consider it a core truth.<br/>
<br/>
But if I were to say "my GM Herbie can run anything. The game can suck, but he can toss out what he doesn't like and then it rocks." and that this system does matter stuff is bogus the response would not be that that is a valid opinion, it would be that that opinion has been addressed and found wanting and that i should perhaps run along now.<br/>
<br/>
System Does Matter is not open for debate in many quarters.  Details may be haggled, but the core premise is sacrosanct (or maybe it isn't, but I at least raise the possibility that this is true). <br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't qualify as One True Way, then hell, yes, I accept that we have radically different understandings of the term.<br/>

<p>What I'm saying is that there is middle ground between "Fact" and "One True Way."  It can be a firmly held belief, which people use as a premise for their arguments, and <em>not</em> be a One True Way.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, One True Way includes two things.  First, it is unquestioned.  Second, it is prescriptive.  It tells you what you should do.</p>
<p>"System Matters" meets the first, for most people who use it.  Certainly for me.  But only a few people use it in a prescriptive manner.</p>

                            Matt, I'm gonna dodge that chunk of things because it's so much its own kettle of fish.  If the assertion is really "The system is everything, ergo, everything is the system" then awesome, but I think we really need to be giving the props to Aristotle rather than Ron. :) it also speaks more to the content of the position, which I am diligently trying to treat as a back box, except insofar as how people use it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Tony, the prescriptive point is a very good one, good enough that I'd say the bulk of things hangs off it (though I'll say that the one true way may alternately be judged by the things it tells you you must not do, but that's a niggling point).<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, I _totally_ accept that the position, as written, is non-prescriptive.  it's an opinion piece, and while it is certainly dismissive of any opposing viewpoints, it is not the writer's responsibility to champions views other than his own.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is that in use, unquestioning acceptance _creates_ those things that must and must not be done - specifically it ends debate and mandates that those who have not yet bought in must be dealt with as if the must be brought into the fold or not, rather than as if they might have a valid position.<br/>
<br/>
Now, those things are happening at the layer of communication, outside of the game, and outside of the scope of what the position addresses, so it definitely muddles the water.<br/>
<br/>
While I don't regret it, it is inconvenient that there is no group of Herbies I can actually point to as people who hold to the position "System Doesn't Matter" and who may also have an essay (and perhaps a flag).  Such a group would create the kind of contrast that is, I think, necessary, to make it clear exactly how many limits on behavior unquestioned belief creates.  I'm left merely thinking about what impact the Anti-Ron would have.<br/>
<br/>
Positing an equally thoughtful and eloquent Anti-Ron, holding the reverse position of actual-Ron, would his position be granted recognition as a valid one, or would it be written off as failing to understand?  I expect the answer would vary from person to person, but if there are people who would dismiss it out of hand, I would say they are letting their belief preclude any number of otherwise reasonable behaviors, and that seems very one true way-ey to me.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly (well, thankfully) we have no Anti-Ron to prove the point one way or another and instead we can only look at the situation as it is and say "Does the attachment to the idea create, in any segment of the population, an objection to any other perspective based purely on the correctness of their position, irrespective of the merits of the other person's position?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I've met folks for whom I could say that is so.<br/>
<br/>
Now, all that said, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if you have _any_ unquestioned position, it's going to look arbitrary to some segment of viewers.  Even if one does not feel that SDM is treated as the One True Way, I hope it is at least illustrative of why someone might feel that OTWism is an issue, rightly or wrongly.<br/>

                            Hey Rob, yeah... honestly? System Does Matter I'm thinking is a matter of experience and faith. It's right up there with One True Wayism in the fact that, as soon as you state it, lines are drawn and agendas are warmed up.<br/><br/>However, it's a small point at that, I don't think it's technically One True Wayism (though it's as "strong" or whatever, it simply doesn't fit in the same category I believe):<br/><br/>"Narrativism is better than Gamism", or "Games where all the rules aim towards the theme that the game supposedly strives for are better than generic systems" is One True Wayism, I think.<br/><br/>But System Does Matter... Hmmm.  I don't see it advocating one thing or behavior over another.  I mean, it's certainly one of those Core Belief things, and people bang drums about it ("Why can't you see that system does matter?" etc), but it's really not advocating one position over another. It's a belief in itself.  Now, from there, of course, with the belief that System Does Matter, you can then say "Systems with focused rules are better than generic games" and the like, which becomes 1TW.<br/><br/>Lame, lame small little point.  I'm just saying that SDM isn't technically 1TW (but certainly can lead to such statements). It's just a belief. It may be an incorrect one, but it in itself is not advocating one set of behaviors over another.  It is a foudnational stone of belief which can lead to advocating sets of behavior (1TW), but in itself it's not 1TW.<br/><br/>But I'm with you on the fact that System Does Matter is a strong belief that, when mentioned, sort of reveals your RPG Sexual Orientation, and can draw some lines (lame-ass gamer lines, but lines at that (^.^)  ) in the sand.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hmm. Well, here's a question that might frame some things.<br/>
<br/>
System Does Matter is clearly in opposition to System Doesn't Matter.<br/>
<br/>
However, System Doesn't Matter is kind of dumb, honestly.  It's such a crap position to champion that it's even hard to champion the possibility that someone might _want_ to champion it.<br/>
<br/>
But is System Does Matter in opposition to any or all of the following?<br/>
<br/>
* System Does Matter But So Do Snacks<br/>
* System Can Matter<br/>
* No Shit System Does Matter - This Was News?<br/>
* System Does Matter If You Infinitely Expand The Definition Of System. Or Matter.<br/>
* System Matters Very Little<br/>
* System Does Matter Only When All Else Fails<br/>
* System Only Matters If You Care About The System<br/>
* System Is Measurable<br/>
* System is the Path of the Lazy<br/>
* System Bit My Sister Once<br/>
<br/>
Does SDM prevent these from becoming valid points of discussion? Maybe.   Maybe not.   But God Knows  I would be really leery of elaborating on any of them, and my Yardstick for 1TWism is how things like that would be handled.<br/>

They're enjoyable, and offer no agenda or hint of that window from which he views the world.<br/><br/>Thus are the majority of folks who believe strongly in System Does Matter, but write cool games that are just cool games, with no "By the way, GURPS sucks" messages in the bylines.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I'm also totally down with "So What."  Even if SDM _is_ the one true way and it's adherents like to run naked through the streets singing jingles, some really good shit has come from it.  It's a good and useful position,a nd if someon genuinely things "Fuck you, it's true" then more power to em. Go forth and kick ass.<br/>
<br/>
The _only_ way it's a problem is because the indie community has an existing reputation problem.  We are John Adams in 1776, rightly or wrongly, and things that can potentially reinforce the idea that there is a "Our way or you're a dumbass" are red flags.  Doesn't mean they're necessarily behaviors to stop, but they might be areas where awareness is a little more necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are a LOT of issues riding on that.<br/>

If that happens, though, I think such a situation can be diffused by PMing or openly going, "Dude, thanks, I'm right there with you: But you're not helping us get anywhere". Maybe it all comes down to a "behavioral thing".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Rob ... do you think there is any way that a person can say "I believe X" such that an irrational detractor will be <em>wholly unable</em> to read it as "If you don't believe X then you're a dumbass"?  Because, frankly, I think it's an impossible goal.</p>
<p>Y'know my take on irrational detractors?  Fuck 'em.  Fuck 'em right in the ear.  Say what you believe, in a way that won't convince a charitable reader that you're a berk, and let the irrational nutjobs think whatever they want.</p>

                            I dunno, I think Levi lays down a fairly solid standard.  You need to be able to say that you made a good faith effort to take other viewpoints into account, even if there will always be a segment that is incorrigible.  Ignoring the irrational detractor can too easily become ignoring the rational detractor otherwise.<br/>

And then, often, the irrational detractor discovers that their bias is showing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they discover that you're not fighting to win but to learn, they tone down, and come at things more reasonably, and that's good.  New friends.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they just make it even more painfully clear that they're being irrational in public, and other people stop listening to them, too, or they just go silent.  Also good. Less noise; they talk about other things, and that's cool.<br/>
<br/>
And, for Rob - I've been the irrational detractor on a few topics.  I got embarrased.  I learned.  That's just life, and admitting when you're wrong can earn just as much respect as being right.                        </div>

<p>Okay, so yeah.  I'm with Levi.</p>
<p>If you write something in a way that a fair-minded person who <em>was</em> ready to listen to you before you started talking becomes convinced that you're full of rubbish then you've done a dumb thing.  It's dumb if you were wrong.  It's dumb if you were right.  It's just plain dumb, no matter what the underlying truth of your argument is.</p>
<p>Now, Rob ... you're saying something <em>above and beyond</em> this about whether a person with their own beliefs can be understanding about people who believe different things.  I'd really love to hear that point, if we can disentangle it from the other stuff.  I'm pretty sure I haven't yet understood what you're getting at there.</p>

<br/>
Supposing someone comes up with a rational objection to SDM.<br/>
<br/>
If SDM is _not_ a one true, there would be some resistance, but it would not be unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
If SDM _is_ a one true way, the initial objections would probably create an unreasonable barrier to discourse.<br/>
<br/>
So that's kind of the question.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I expect  _no one_ is such a zealot that, should discourse actually break out, they would be unwilling to be drawn out.  However, I worry that the current level of attachment to the idea creates an atmosphere that is sufficiently hostile to opposing ideas that no such discourse will ever actually _start_.  That, more than anything else, is the concrete problem that underlies my concern.<br/>

<p>But ... okay, seriously, why would an initial barrier to discourse be unreasonable?</p>
<p>If I've tested a principle, and it's worked reliably, and I've built stuff on that foundation that worked well ... why should I give the contrary opinion <em>just as much credence</em>?  Isn't "Well, I really don't think so, but I'm listening ... convince me" a pretty reasonable position?</p>

You get to discuss your issue, and what's more, you often learn something new about a part of the issue you're curious about.                        </div>

                            As it stands, if someone comes in and thinks SDM is Crap and they want to discuss that on the Forge, the burden of proof is on them because it's baked into the community. <br/>
On RPG.net, they've got no burden of proof. Live or die by what you post - no one's going to read the essay you link to.<br/>
Here....I dunno yet.  We've still got enough of a Forge population that many, though certainly not all, forge assumptions are in place.  How that's gonna shake out is hugely interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
Still, setting aside the specific site biases, let's accept worst case: the burden of proof is on the detractor.  He's stepped into SDM's kingdom, and whatever he's done outside of it doesn't come with him - he's got to make his case.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that's at least mildly onerous.  It's not an insurmountable barrier, but if his argument is only _as good_ as Ron's, he'll fail. It would be _hard_, but it would be doable, especially if the people who are outliers on the SDM issue start gravitating over and adding their voice to the discourse, or at least so we ideally hope.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it's a non-inconsequential barrier, so what happens when something makes that barrier higher?  What happens if a groups attachment to an idea is unquestioned, so there are no outliers.  At that point, it would seem, a reasonable man packs up his things and goes home.  At that point I tend to think everyone suffers.<br/>
<br/>
So is an initial barrier unreasonable? Absolutely not.  It's to be expected.  But not every barrier is necessarily a reasonable one, and unquestioning belief can be a strong contributor to a barrier becoming unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Is the barrier on SDM too high?  I dunno. I think so, but we're getting into judgement calls. <br/>

                            You mean a question like: " why "System Does Matter" is not a One True Way?" :)<br/>
<br/>
And Levi, you've effectively illustrated why I'm trying my level best to continue to treat SDM as a black box.  Certainly, there are ways which one can try to discuss something, even in the face of a barrier, but I don't place that at question.  My concern is whether the absolute belief in SDM is unreasonably limiting to discourse where that discourse would disagree with or undermine the premise.<br/>
<br/>
Tony's made a really good case that the solidity of the belief has no causal relationship with the unwillingness to discuss it, and that rational discourse is another knob on the dashboard altogether.  And it's a tough point to argue - at best, one can demonstrate that there is correlation between belief and the unwillingness to discuss, but correlation is a tricky bitch when it comes to making a case.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it also illustrated some radically different views on what exactly one true wayism denotes, and that would probably need to be hammere dout more for there to be an _answer_, but I'm fairly content without one.  I feel fairly confident that it's not hard to see why the adherence to SDM might _look_ like 1TW, whether it is or note, and that's good enough. :)<br/>

<p>I submit that unreasonable limits are part and parcel of the kinds of discourse, and the topics of them, that many of us want to engage in all the damn time, and that it's more useful to look for ways around them than to determine what is and isn't an unreasonable limit and debate there.</p>

                            Quite possibly.  Ultimately we are, obviously, only responsible for our own actions.  To take a concern with how a group will behave is almost always quixotic and frequently quite painful.  Of course, it can be argued that to do otherwise is needlessly cynical. Still, at worse, I'd say there's no harm to coming at it from both sides.<br/>

As with so many issues here, it all seems to come down to who you're doing it all for.  Answer that and the rest gets much easier, even though it will quickly put you at loggerheads with some. :)<br/>

Rob, it seems to me that, in this thread, you're pretty much equating "one true way" with "the thought that any statement, ever, contains truth value."<br/>

In which case, slap me silly and call me one true way.<br/>

Perhaps a more precise phrasing might be "Is SDM considered open to question?" and leave whether or not a "no" means it's a one true way (loaded phrase that it is) up to the viewer. <br/>

                            I think it's important to have foundational ideas, so that you can <i>move on</i> and talk about other things. Otherwise, every time you start exploring a new idea and a new person joins the discussion, the entire group doesn't have to rehash everything again. This is a <i>paradigm</i> in Kuhn terms.<br/><br/>Is a paradigm a One True Way? Maybe. I don't like the zealotism associated with OTW. Paradigms are tested, and sometimes broken. OTW has religious overtones -- and maybe we're getting to semantics now, but this is all a semantic discussion, no? One True Way-ists close their eyes and repeat their mantra without a possibility of change. I don't think that's what the SDM paradigm is. If someone were to introduce a strong case to the contrary -- generally in the form of a game design or actual play report that showed that system doesn't actually matter -- I'd listen. I haven't seen it though. <br/><br/>Is "System Does Matter" a paradigm? Yeah, probably. Is this a bad thing? Probably not.<br/><br/>Rob, if you're entirely correct that SDM is a OTW, what changes? I'm not being flip when I ask this; I really want to know: what is your point?<br/><br/>I suspect that some of your discussion was fed by our discussion in my LiveJournal (and other experiences you've had with Forgizens). Have you tried to make a case with us that system doesn't matter, and we shut you down without listening?                        </div>

                            Main hope of this hinges upon a hope that folks see that they have paradigms and well thought out beliefs, and that 1TWs are something other people have.<br/>
<br/>
That's kind of tongue in cheek though, so here's the real reason - When the day comes that I say "This system does matter line of thought is shallow to the point of uselessness/Pure Bullshit/Broken/Wrong/Flawed/French/insert thing here" that a lot of the people who's automatic response is "You just don't _understand_ it" might pause for just a fraction of a second. :)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that also leads to the other purpose: gauging how big a headache it would be to make any such case, and at the moment, the answer is "More than  would be useful."  Which is ok. I'm patient.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS - And to answer: no, no one has shut down such an attempt, but at the same time, I would never, never, never, never even consider beginning such a discussion on the forge. and while some of the reasons for that represent a subjective divide, others are planted firmly in the fact that I would have to hack through a jungle of premises to get to any question that interests me, and there's little return on that.  On the other hand, I wouldn't discuss it on rpg.net just because that would be inviting a flamewar or worse.   This place might yet be the place for the discussion, but not yet.                        </div>

                            Reading one of Chad's threads also cast into sharp relief the other reason.<br/>
<br/>
See, the forge is full of smart, interesting people who, when I've met them, have been universally neat and a pleasure to meet.  To make sweeping generalizations, they really give a damn about games, and they've thought about them a lot.  And were I to sit down with a cup of coffee and any one of them across the table I think I'd be happy to argue this stuff into the fucking ground, and that's a damn fine thing.<br/>
<br/>
But this is not a table, and I have no coffee, and I do not trust the internet to support that discussion.  There are more reasons for this than I can go into, some very solidly thought out, and some almost entirely spurious.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm inclined to kick at the corners.  Poke and see if premises are so sacred they can't be touched.  See what kind of communication _is_ possible.<br/>
<br/>
And hell, I mean, as is, there's a huge amount of good stuff to talk about.  Just not everything.  S'why Levi's suggestions, while well intentioned, mostly just make me smile.  If I just wanted conversation, of course that could happen.  But I'm demanding, and I'm a troublemaker, and I want to sink my teeth into the damn sacred cows and make some hamburger. And what drives me nuts is that I know, in principal, that's the whole goddamned point of the forge.<br/>
<br/>
Which is great. It really is. Awesome things have come of it. But I also feel it's gone the way of all revolutions, and that's less awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is getting into "What I like and dislike about the forge" which is not a place i want to spend much time in.  instead, i swing back to the point: There is a divide between where i stand (perhaps alone) and where I see the forge.  I'd prefer to correct that, so given the opportunity, I'll poke at it. :)<br/>
