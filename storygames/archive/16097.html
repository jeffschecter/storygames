As with most essays by Edwards, I felt thinky after reading, and a bit punchy. Here's my reaction. It seemed reasonable to start another tread to see if people had further thoughts on this, rather than de-railing the previous discussion which really wasn't about the essay directly, much at all:<br/><br/><br/>Hrm. I like how Ron punks "sandbox" play as an ambiguous shibboleth coined by misty-eyed nostalgicism, and then turns straight around and lauds "your Glorantha may vary" as a mechanism for gloriously vibrant creation through localized interaction with a setting by selective embracement of detail.<br/><br/>Funny -- that's what I thought "sandbox" play actually meant. Here's a setting, of some size, evocative in detail to some degree, not in plot. Now it's yours, go have fun. In other words, "your Wilderlands of High Fantasy may vary". Hrm.<br/><br/>In my reading of many of the leading, actually playing, lights in the OSR end of the hobby, it seems to me that the focus they propose of dynamic "just draw it out at the table" gaming is more similar than not of the sorts of details Ron proposes for Story Now play: Start with some evocative detail ("sword &amp; sorcery pulp-age fantasy type vibe! dark gods, here are some capsule descriptions!"), and a tightly focussed setting ("ummmm... this dungeon"), some characters that are lightly created, but -belong there- ("ummmm... OK, here's a fighter, a thief, a cleric, and a magic-user: why are they here? because they want -gold-"), introduce a radical conflict trigger ("you've been exploring mostly empty rooms for five hours; suddenly you hear a hideous shambling noise -between you and the exit-, and your torches are -burning low-...").<br/><br/>Ron makes a lot of good points, as he seems to in all the essays of his that I have read. But he also seems to have a pretty solid axe to grind. Which is fine, I suppose, but at the end of the day, he still seems to be doing his part to attempt to invalidate other people's fun. I'm not sure I'm cool with that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366809/#Comment_366809" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:41:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I can see how someone might get a burr up their nose about that sandbox aside. What Ron's saying about it, though, is simply that he isn't seeing a clear definition of what the word means. That's his problem, isn't it? I mean, I don't know of any official language institute that'd have defined the term either, but I've seen contexts where that word has been used in functional and useful ways. Not having an exacting universal definition isn't much of an obstacle - don't use the word if it feels too ambiguous, and if you do use it or see it used, read charitably and try to figure out whether there's something useful being said.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it should be noted that Ron's writing here exclusively about narrativist attempts at getting some use out of intricately detailed settings in roleplaying games. That's a pretty specific topic, and it means that he's going to judge things from that viewpoint: many things that have a purpose for other perspectives won't be useful for him, here.<br/><br/>As for the bulk of the article: if you don't already know this stuff, then now's a high time to learn, assuming you're at all interested in narrativism / Story Now. I say this qualitatively because people who already grog say <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> will probably not see anything new in Ron's recipe: this is totally tread ground, I've utilized these techniques myself in e.g. Glorantha-based gaming. It works, is fun, and truly enables one to have a meaningful narrativist game while also having a plentiful setting background for it all.<br/><br/>The OSR connection is tenuous to my mind, most OSR games and gamers explicitly embrace things like the party model and adventure-based goal-oriented play as techniques, so they're likely not going to be interested in an alternative model of structuring the campaign. (I don't even need to go into the creative agenda contradiction here.) Perhaps we'll get a good flame war about this if we do our best, though?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366812/#Comment_366812" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:50:18+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The crux here is, do you think OSR play requires a DM coming up with complete detailed plots in advance, or is winging it and focusing on the characters while kicking in dungeon doors cool?<br/><br/>If you are of the belief that OSR play demands a plot and narrative locked in by a DM in advance, then yeah they're incompatible.<br/><br/>If you are of the belief that OSR play can still have dungeons and trolls, but have an open plot that focuses on a character, then they are totally compatible.

"Detailed plots in advance" is trad gaming, not OSR. (And notice I'm agreeing with <i>Zak</i> here!)<br/><br/>The reason the OSR and Story Now playstyles are incompatible is not because they require different skills from the GM (though they do, to an extent), nor is it because they require different mechanical tools (though I do believe different tools are helpful for each). Rather, the reason they don't mesh well together is because Story Now requires a focus on human, moral issues that tends to kill pure exploration and resource management dead.<br/><br/>If you really wanted to play a game that married those styles as much as possible, though, I would look at doing a "Burning Thac0" style game, or the forthcoming Mouse Guard hack Dungeoneers and Dragonslayers.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366829/#Comment_366829" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:14:19+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the biggest problem for doing Story Now with an OSR style game is the complete lack of interest in who the character is and why he's chosen to go into a dungeon in search of wealth.

You can have sandbox-structured games that fit a variety of Creative Agendas, so there's nothing that necessarily makes sandbox and Story Now (or any other agenda) antithetical.<br/><br/>The relationship between sandbox play and OSR play is closely related but not the same. Both are part of the "play to find out what happens" school of practices, which means the players have agency to do whatever they want, within the agreed-upon boundaries of the game, and the GM "follows the player around" and makes the game about those choices and their consequences. However, the OSR has a bunch of other stuff going on that plugs into some aspects of Creative Agenda, and is -- again, IME -- a much more specific term and school of play than "sandbox," which seems to be a more general concept (and is sometimes used to talk about campaign structures in which there's only the illusion that the players can do anything).<br/><br/>In my thinking, the OSR as a whole probably isn't best analyzed in terms of Ron's three Creative Agendas (Step on Up, Story Now, Right to Dream), because it's a semi-established set of practices that includes aspects of all of them and can be approached by players in a few different ways. The OSR is maybe better thought of as a "tradition of play" (complex, interconnected and somewhat diverse) rather than a consistent "style of play" if that makes any sense (it does in my mind, but maybe not to you). That said, it might be useful to examine specific swaths of OSR play and the diverse motivations involved from a Creative Agenda perspective (which is -- IME -- where the idea of CAs is most useful, not in analyzing game texts or traditions of play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx" title="malcolmpdx"><img alt="malcolmpdx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx">malcolmpdx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366843/#Comment_366843" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:40:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really don't have a good handle on what a lot of these terms mean, so this is only my take on how I've seen them used, which may be pretty varied.<br/><br/>Generally, when someone says "sandbox" they really mean "no GM generated plot, "railroading", rules that tell me what to do".  It's more of a statement against, than a statement for, most of the time.<br/><br/>That usually degenerates into an argument about whether players "really want this" or if it's even possible, given that the GM is typically describing everything, and making decisions about what every other freaking thing in the game world does other than the players, and so has significant ability to guide, plot and railroad even when they may not be aware they're doing it.<br/><br/>But I think that's missing the point.  What I really think sandbox means is "I get to feel like I'm in control" from a player perspective.  Which I totally get.  We probably all want that, we just have different ways of feeling that we're being listened to.<br/><br/>What's funny is that a lot of folks who use "sandbox" also really dislike having a lot of rules - and especially hate rules that try to force a certain sort of game experience on players - which I suppose goes back to issues with plotting and railroading and control.  They often hate it when someone else says "the game is _about_" because for them, the game is "about" whatever the hell they want it to be about, and emphatically NOT what the rules imply, or what the GM says.  So minimal rule sets are awesome, because they don't place any strictures on what might happen.<br/><br/>The only real analogy I can draw is the difference between literature and poetry - OSR is like literature, in the sense that there are few rules, it's very free and open, and can take a long time for anything to happen, but that can be OK.  Trad RP is a bit like genre fiction - it's telling a specific sort of story, and so has more rules, but is still pretty likely to take a while.  This story-game stuff, from what I've seen, seems to be more like poetry - highly restricted in form, and with a particular set of rules that are aiming for something very directly (i.e. "it's _this_ sort of game") which often brings the climax faster, and meanders less, which some folks like, and others can't stand.<br/><br/>I think it comes down to where you like to spend the majority of your time...OSR likes to spend the majority of it's time following characters around and seeing what happens - Trad does the same thing, but for very specific plots - Story games likes to get to the blood and guts right away.  Not to say that some OSR games dont turn into something "epic and trad" on their own, and not to say that some Trad games have moments of great beauty, emotion, and all the other stuff that story games aim at, and pretty much every possible combination thereof.

And I'm pretty sure he's not saying that it is, when he says:\n<blockquote>As far as I can tell, it can mean anything but railroading, but that means it can include the whole range of Story Before, Now, or After, and the whole range of setting use from barely-any to all-encompassing.</blockquote>\nI think his point is that the term doesn't map well with Ron's terminology. And that if your goal is to play in a setting-rich Story Now style, you could do it using the OSR sandbox methodology, but that by using the OSR sandobox methodology, you don't necessarily get to that style of play.<br/><br/>And considering that play is generally driven by light characterization where characters are pawns through which the players interact with the challenges of the setting...<br/><br/>And also considering that there's nothing inherent in the rules or setting books that encourages players to create characters that are deeply embedded in the setting rather than wandering adventurers (frex, Keep on the Borderlands assumes that you're a band of outsiders just arriving at the keep, rather than folks who are living there and are part of the network of interconnected relationships present at the Keep)...<br/><br/>It's unlikely that you'll arrive at the type of play he's talking about, where you're deeply engaged in the local ecology, culture, religion, economics, politics, in a deeply personal, not an "outsider who's been drawn into this web of intrigue" way.<br/><br/>Disparate bands of murderhobos hunting dungeons looking for gold is just not the same type of interaction with the setting, even when your GM and group does a good job of engaging relatively strongly with the setting.<br/><br/>And when a setting provides ample opportunity for guilt-free killing and looting by providing caves filled with unambiguously evil monsters, you just aren't going to have the same kind of interactions with the setting that Ron's talking about.<br/><br/>Again, it's not that you CAN'T have deep interactions with the setting in an OSR game. It's just that, by itself, the game doesn't make it very likely that you will, and does very little to encourage it to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366856/#Comment_366856" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:18:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The OSR is maybe better thought of as a "tradition of play" (complex, interconnected and somewhat diverse) rather than a consistent "style of play" if that makes any sense (it does in my mind, but maybe not to you). That said, it might be useful to examine specific swaths of OSR play and the diverse motivations involved from a Creative Agenda perspective (which is -- IME -- where the idea of CAs is most useful, not in analyzing game texts or traditions of play).</blockquote>\nDefinitely. If we wanted to talk about OSR creative agendas, I'm seeing a lot of gamism in there, but also others in minority portions. Not much else to be said about it, aside from the fact that there are some excellent tools for gamist play available in the OSR tradition. Less so for the other agendas, perhaps, or it might be that I simply haven't yet understood and perceived how to do the other things with the OSR tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366859/#Comment_366859" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:25:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:25PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure seems like if anyone's gonna make any meaningful headway, you'd have to define "OSR", "style", "play", "Story Now" (probably the only term of art with a definition more than one person agrees with), "antithetical" and "sandbox".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366871/#Comment_366871" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:47:19+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:47PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 12:48PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only grinding of gears I notice is in the area of challenge:<br/><br/>If you can invent not-your-PC-based assets (as you can in many Story Now approaches) then the field of conflict is fundamentally different than it is in a game where you can only control what your PC does.<br/><br/>The possibility of a carefully titrated level of overall narrative control tied to in-game challenge-based performance (and perhaps feeding back into the next challenge) like in Marvel FASERIP or <br/><br/><a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/11/not-quite-shatnerday.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/11/not-quite-shatnerday.html</a><br/><br/>or Pendragon seems totally possible.<br/><br/>In practice, through things like at-the-table invention of Cleric gods or negotiated long-term player goals (requiring, for instance, the player going "I'm looking for a sage who can tell me if there's aby use for....") mean the door <i>is</i> open.

The only person having trouble with definitions here is Ron because he doesn't get what sandbox means.<br/><br/>OSR is very much about developing fruitful procedures of play with old systems, which almost exclusively means D&amp;D as it was published (roughly) before the mid-eighties. Its actual play is very much gamist, like Eero notes.<br/><br/>OSR is not a creative agenda as such, so it's not antithetic to SN, but its play certainly doesn't go into that direction. They are close cousins in the sense that they are both averse to any sort of preconceived plot or foregone conclusions, but they aim for different goals in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366891/#Comment_366891" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:14:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I would also add that you shouldn't be fooled by the words "Story Now" into thinking that it's about story or indeed about immediacy. It's not about story in the normal sense of the word. The definition of Story Now indicates that to qualify, a<i>moral statement</i>must be made in play<i>by the players</i>. In other words, just the portrayal of character motivations or the exploration of an adventuresome psychology is not enough. The players must express some kind of morality through play to qualify as Story Now. If they don't, it doesn't.<br/><br/>"Old School" is just a term people use to yell at the new kids, always has been, so I won't weigh in there.

Moral judgements and hard character choices and all that good stuff.<br/><br/>Which are 2 different things.<br/><br/>I think part of the confusion comes from the fact that OSR-style sandbox play (inasmuch as that is a defined style, which it only sort of is) strongly encourages at least a certain degree of "plot determined through play". But it doesn't really encourage "theme-driven exploration happens during play".<br/><br/>Nor does OSR style sandbox play generally encourage "players introduce elements into the fiction outside of the constraints of characterization (such as, there's a chair there because I want it to be there in order to throw it at someone)" which is a technique often strongly associated with Story Now play and Story Now inspired rulesets, but not inextricably intertwined with that creative agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366892/#Comment_366892" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:17:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:23PM by PeterBB.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>By my understanding, if how the bullet bounces<i>matters and can kill other PCs or NPCs and can affect the whole course of the fiction</i>then you are out of "Right To Dream" territory, right?</blockquote>\nI don't think so. (Please, someone stop me if I'm fucking up the theory. I think it's useful, and I think I get it, but it's complicated and maybe I'm wrong.)<br/><br/>Right to Dream is about exploration, in a broad sense. If what you want to do is see how the bullet bounces, and how that affects things, and you get to see that thing, then you're doing Right to Dream.<br/><br/>If you want to decide as players how characters (in the sense of human-like people with moral stances) react to the moral questions created by the bullet ricocheting (so maybe like the ricochet is a crystallization of the moment of dread when you/the characters realize the consequences of your actions and have to deal with that shit by making some morally hard choice), then you're doing Story Now.<br/><br/>EDIT: Fucked up a couple important words.<br/><br/>EDIT 2: And JDCorley below is of course right. I was extrapolating to assume that all anyone cared about in the game was a constant series of things like bullets ricocheting, which I think would be Right to Dream.

Maybe the "dream" that is being played out here is the detailed and correct description of gun physics, not the construction of a right narrative.

I like how he tries his best to be informed even as he disagrees with the Godhead.<br/><br/>I have to say, though, that I would <i>expect</i> a game that featured players being interested in bullet ricochets to be simulationistic, especially if the interest is consistent. It feels natural to me that I would play some game about let's say criminal lifestyle, and we would really get into how, exactly, our bank robbery becomes a mess. We would be totally into determining the ricochets because it would just be so cool if some innocent bystander bought it, and my character who is a total loser never saw that coming when he pulled the trigger. Definitely could be sim, sim is often played with systems that actually provide some tools for bullet-ricochets. Of course, I can name at least one narrativist system where bullet ricochets are explicitly chosen as a venue: <i>kill puppies for satan</i>.<br/><br/>But as Jason says, ultimately we could be inordinately ricochet-curious for any agenda reason. Ricocheting bullets are what the theory calls <i>ephemera</i>, on-going details the players focus on in passing in service of a greater goal. To perceive the Creative Agenda, we need to recognize why these players are excited about playing this game, at this time, with these people. (I say that in that way specifically to close off the "I don't care what we play as long as we play something" red herring.) What is the gaming activity providing? For many OSR gamers it seems to be providing challenging excitement (gamism), but even that is obviously a humongously large slice of creative possibilities; plenty of room for nuance within that box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366906/#Comment_366906" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:41:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:41PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I get it with the bullets.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Basically, if you want to do OSR and Story Now (i.e. with Values) and feel you want system support, play Burning Wheel or a hack thereof.<br/><br/>If you don't feel you want system support and can freeball it, read How To Start A Revolution in 21 Days or less every time it's updated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366913/#Comment_366913" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:55:03+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience with "OSR" and "Story Now", I think they are antithetical in practice.<br/><br/>Story Now is about establishing, discovering, and authoring Theme (in Egri-speak, to Address Premise) through play.

I could hack up a game that used only tools that OSR D&amp;D recognizes and achieve this. Those tools would, of course, be used in different ways: I might have thematically provocative random encounter tables, more Charisma and Wisdom checks to regulate character behaviour (basically, to get characters to do foolish things they'd have to atone for later), advice to the GM in how to build his adventure locations, special xp conditions maybe, and so on. This is all just mechanics and methodical tools, the OSR has a rich selection. Story Now / narrativism (same thing, if somebody was unclear - I prefer the old name) does not require player control of narratives, no matter what some people might think; those narrative control tools are just situationationally useful for certain game structures.<br/><br/>In fact, if you take something like <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and give it to an OSR gamer, I don't think that there is a huge amount of game mechanics in that that would be anathema. He might not be interested in the game's insistence of ignoring tactical positioning detail, but that's creative agenda talking - TSoY just thinks that it's more important who you love than whether you have a short or a long sword. You could convert TSoY easily enough into something "OSR-compatible" simply by... well, really, somebody with a better nose would have to tell me what the OSR would find anathema in there. <i>Every</i> mechanic of the Solar System that implies e.g. player narration rights is optional, you could play an entire campaign without a player ever making a decision outside character perspective. <i>Maybe</i> the one thing that would cause the most hiccups would be the notion that the GM is mandated to edit and select the content of play to emphasize interesting fictional events over everything else. (This is called "pacing and scene framing" in the subculture.) I don't see myself how this could be different in any game, though - surely nobody plays a roleplaying game by devoting exactly the same amount of time and attention to the in-character days when nothing happens and then days when everything happens all at once.<br/><br/>Myself, though, I don't think that "OSR compatibility" is that important. I'm not curious about OSR D&amp;D because of some misguided notion of purity, I just see an unique game there that does things I don't see others doing. I don't know how common the sort of OSR gamer really is who gets offended by modern game mechanics (dice pools are the Devil's invention!) but would in fact love narrativistic gaming if he only could get it with his old, good OSR game mechanics instead of these stinky, treacherous resource pools and such the hipsters play with. I instead imagine that the OSR is dominated by people who genuinely like the creative opportunities D&amp;D offers them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366936/#Comment_366936" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:07:39+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            so.. what is the officially sanctioned name for "plot determined during play" ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366937/#Comment_366937" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:08:37+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>My answer to the topic question is: no, they're not antithetical at all.<br/><br/>Some of the funnest times I've had in the past 5 years have come from seeing and trying to figure out the relationship between D&amp;D, Story Now and Step On Up.<br/><br/>I like to say that sometimes there are<i>tactical circumstances that provide texture to the moral situation</i>, and sometimes there are<i>moral circumstances that provide texture to the tactical situation</i>, and D&amp;D loves to cross back and forth over the line between them.</blockquote>\nYikes. Every time I've crossed over that line with a play group, it's led to UnFun Now play. I'm sure if I had the opportunity to play with your playgroup regularly, Vincent, it'd work great, but it pretty much never has for me.

I'm not aware of any wide-spread jargon for this. The Forge theory is sufficiently concerned with Creative Agenda that things like "Story Now" specifically are intended to mean not only "plot determined during play", but specifically "plot generated by thematic choices made during play". Its got consequences and its got choices, but you can easily have those without having the choices primarily concern thematic weight-lifting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366946/#Comment_366946" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:40:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 3:45PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the OSR-of-my-understanding the consequences are often merely simulationally determined.<br/><br/>Like "dude, you knew he was the head priest and you killed him in front of like nine guys"<br/><br/>There is a lotta stretch for GM fiat in there, but in general the idea is if you put a moving part with a known-to-them response profile (when you do A, expect <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> in front of players<i> before</i> they make a move, if it does what they'd expect it to do in response to their move (you did A) that's 100% legit sandboxery.<br/><br/>At a certain point a GM can make a location so thick with these AB devices and incurring the B can be so thick with judgment calls (how long does it take the news of your betrayal to travel?) that it ceases to be a sandbox because there is no clean view of Player Choice A resulting in Setting Response B.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366948/#Comment_366948" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:49:03+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>If by combining OSR and Story Now we mean "play a sandbox game that retains player freedom, sets the GM as the gatekeeper of the world and reliably creates theme as per Egri", then I believe that this is eminently doable.</blockquote>\nQFT, basically what I said earlier.

You know, "So after long negotiations  with the local baron, your group agrees to clear his basement of critters..." That's not sandbox play. Sandbox play is "Where do you want to go now?" or (better) "Where do you want to go next week?"<br/><br/>I'm not sure if everyone agrees that sandbox play means a hexcrawl or something like it. I'm pretty sure sandbox play means that the GM isn't allowed to pick up his dungeon and drop it in the path of the PCs; that's considered Not Cricket. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

It seems to me that if the goal of the game is going to be that "a moral statement must be made in play by the players", the tendency is going to be to put the spotlight on one player to drill down on their moral conflict. When I played a long-running trad D&amp;D; campaign with only one player over the phone, it explored lots of moral choices even though I didn't know anything much about RPG theory or technique and there was nothing in the mechanics to support it - it was just that we could keep exploring the consequences of the choices of that one character over time, without distraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is implicit in what Eero says above about embracing the party model. I really like it when the spotlight is quickly moving enough that everyone stays more or less lit, and that means as a GM I am going to look to create situations that engage every player at once by virtue of having their characters contributing to a charged situation that's ripe with possibilities and has enough moving parts for everyone to do something in the same scene. I've sometimes seen a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/w33:hell-on-wheels" rel="nofollow">group moral conflict</a> emerge from this kind of OSR play, and it was really exciting and meaningful to all involved, but it just emerged out of a lot of play together getting to know characters and personalities (on the player side) and randomly generating some balrogs and thinking "what these demons want to do is to push mortals' buttons" (on the GM side).

Apocalypse World feels to me like the resolution is meant to be player-changes-world and not party-chips-down-enemy-hit-points, whereas the way that 4e seems least to me like a storygame is that its emphasis on balanced combat teamwork leads to eliminating interesting individual spotlight mechanics in earlier editions where a single character could make a moral choice about whether to use their totally game-changing spell or magic item to achieve this outcome or that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367005/#Comment_367005" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T20:06:30+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I donno.

It's perhaps an exception from the rule insofar as games designed explicitly for this purpose are concerned. It's a bit of an expert game, also: the most common misplay with it regards this very issue, as players trained to execute cooperative party play fail to emphasize individual character viewpoints sufficiently and end up in a "us versus the world" mindset. I personally think that this just tells us about the difficulty of communicating different but superficially similar games effectively within a group; somebody else might think that it's the very notion of having a party in a narrativist game that's wrong-headed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367029/#Comment_367029" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T21:28:35+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  9:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if it's not-Story-Now if the whole group collectively makes the moral statement instead of one player (at a time?)

My experience (not with Dogs, but Mountain Witch - another narrativist game with the party trope, and similarly vulnerable) has been that <i>sometimes</i> the players are genuinely expressing moral concensus when they act in tandem, but other times they're just thoughtlessly grouping together. It's actually pretty easy to perceive which it is if you're there at the table, it's evident in the table chatter. The moral concensus is not a problem, and even the reflexive grouping can be played with <i>if the players are willing to let go at some point</i>. A pro forma moral statement is not as important in a narrativist game as having such statement carry weight in the context of the story, and this we can only achieve if the players depict characters who are true to life and vulnerable: this will not happen if the players are acting routinely in the face of adversity and never consider the challenges their characters face from the moral viewpoint of their characters.<br><br>I could just about imagine a Dogs session where the characters agreed all the time about everything. If this was the result of talks and soul-searching, then everything's good and the game can proceed to the next town over, where the GM will presumably seek to drive some wedges. If the players are of like mind because of a siege mentality or because they're seeking to "win", then it's not going to work - the game's not mechanically set up for mindless combat for the same of combat, it's not going to be particularly fun.<br/><br/>I should mention that some of my best <i>Mountain Witch</i> plays have ended up with concensus between the characters: they all decide that whatever's at stake, their interests and values are aligned. I think that it's easy for anybody to see that this will only be an interesting and meaningful outcome if the play so far has featured and established interesting differences that the players can set aside to reach this concensus. If the characters were all along consistently single-minded and the game never featured tensions between them, then their final agreement won't be that surprising or interesting, either.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367147/#Comment_367147" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T10:31:28+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is so crazy. I just spent the past week discussing/arguing about this in chat with various friends. Weird. Is it the hotness of Stars Without Number? Dunno. <br/><br/>I started thinking about this w/r/t Burning Wheel -- can your BITs accrete around the setting, which basically just reverses the standard setting-accretes-around-your-BITs scheme? Does that make it a sandbox? Does it make the play more OSRish? Then I got the SWN hardback and now I'm gonna put that thesis to the test, mostly by ripping out its default reward/advancement scheme (tl/dr version: level up for achieving goals set by the GM) and replacing it with something that should produce more Story Now-ish play.<br/><br/>I was talking the other day with Peter Aronson, who's an even-older-old-timer than me, about the weirdness that is OSR. He described it as funhouse mirrors: For those of us who actually played the old-school games, the deconstruction/reverse-engineering/sentimentality around how OSR is described is just *weird.* Sometimes there was a "sandbox" type element to it, and sometimes there wasn't -- I'm not sure I would instantly conflate "sandbox" and "old school". There were many many dungeons, which I would hesitate to characterize as anything more than severely constrained sandboxes. Sometimes you were just there to get the XPs, and sometimes you weren't. Sometimes it was a survival slog (fantasy Vietnam). Sometimes the players became so comfortable with the setting assumptions that it wasn't hard to figure out correct/reasonable outcomes for the setting, freeing up bandwidth for more character-driven drama. I suppose the OSR creators are wrangling all those questions as well. But heck, given the huge, huge range of possible definitions for "OSR", I honestly have no idea how to gauge whether it's antithetical to Story Now. I was only half-kidding with my first post.<br/><br/>Here's my thought, starting with my internal definitions:<br/><br/>Sandbox play: The setting exists apart from the authorial needs of the players, and is created and managed by a central authority.<br/>Story Now play: The players address "premise" through character-driven play in a way that cannot be planned for in advance by a central authority.<br/>OSR play: who the heck knows?<br/><br/>So. Given the central authority can't preplan the premise-addressing itself, and the central authority is responsible for generating setting material, that leaves premise as something the players are responsible for generating within the confines of a setting over which they have no authorial control. Seems totally reasonable, with caveats.<br/><br/>IMO for real sandbox play, outcomes need to maintain and promote consistency within the sandbox. Outcomes that affect the sandbox, that is. The sandbox can shift around likely and reasonable outcomes of actions by the characters, but that's gonna be on the GM to determine. The moment the non-GM players have some authorship, that makes the whole thing a lot less sandboxy. Which is maybe not a bad thing. And may have nothing to do with the OP, which asks about OSR and not <i>per se</i> sandbox.<br/><br/>My only real caveat, before I get started with my SWN experiment, is that there will be "moments of play" where addressing premise and mantaining sandbox will come into conflict. If it's real old-school, it's on the GM to make that call -- your character drama's need wins this time, maintaining the setting's assumptions wins next time. Whatever. <br/><br/>At the very very worst, I can't see this as any worse than ... using an inefficient toolset for either kind of play. But it may also reveal new material and approaches! Inefficiencies aren't awful, as long as the players have the patience for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367151/#Comment_367151" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T10:44:23+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2012 10:46AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do not confuse "the OSR" with "attempts to claim people used to roll back in the day the way we do".<br/><br/>That's like saying the Ramones were an attempting to sound like Buddy Holly.<br/><br/>And anything is more efficient than buying a new game every week, reading it and rolling whole new characters just because you want to move the focus to a different thing for a few hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367152/#Comment_367152" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T10:44:38+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Sure seems like if anyone's gonna make any meaningful headway, you'd have to define "OSR"...</blockquote>\nYes, please. <br/><br/>48 posts and everyone assumes OSR is a recognizable acronym like D&amp;D or ATM.

If the players are of like mind because of a siege mentality or because they're seeking to "win", then it's not going to work - the game's not mechanically set up for mindless combat for the same of combat, it's not going to be particularly fun.</blockquote>\nWell, I donno. I think a group that seeks consensus about what to do and how far to go, then Sticks To The Plan can be very effective and fun in Dogs.  <br/><br/>There's this feeling that if the players aren't struggling that they're not playing Dogs right or effectively. But that's not been true in my experience. I've had some very confident people enjoy Dogs a great deal, because it gives them a language by which they can express their confidently-held moral positions. They don't mind if the GM escalates or causes unintended consequences - they are perfectly fine with it - they did the right thing - they know they did - let's move on to the next town - anything bad that happens, the poor bastards brought it on themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367167/#Comment_367167" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T11:04:35+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 11:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So why step in with "don't mistake this for that" talk, Zak?

Instead of rejecting the things that seem weird about early games, I like that the OSR attempts to place them in a context where they make perfect sense.

It seems to me that OSR (which I understood to mean either "Old School Renaissance" or "Old School Roleplaying") might be best seen in a historical framework.  I may be entirely wrong, given that the folks I know who identify with OSR are, in fact, people who were around and playing in the earliest days of RPGs, i.e. the late 70s.  <br/><br/>What I sense is that it's at least in part a reaction to all the stuff that's happened in the hobby since then.  Innovations which, while certainly not bad, changed things, and made some older RPGers (and some newer ones) feel like stuff had been lost along the way.  <br/><br/>I'm still working out exactly what stuff might have been considered lost - but several things come to mind.  <br/><br/>1) Simple chargen -  This seems to be a thing that comes up fairly frequently.  Complex chargen has gotten more common, whether it be a lot of messing about with purchasing from a points pool, or lots of backstory.  The general feel I've gotten from OSR folks is that they would rather have a quick, fast, likely random chargen system ala OD&amp;D that allows them to get to actually "playing" fast, and figure out the other stuff as they play, if they want to.<br/><br/>2) the "sandbox" idea - GMs not providing a single plot, but providing an open setting where character activities matter, in some sense I'm not at all clear on.  There's a fair amount of subtle stuff here, that is not terribly well defined, but most OSR gamers I know seem to have an internal understanding of what they mean by this.<br/><br/>3) simple game mechanics, in two ways.  One, a reaction against the rather complex rulesets from the 80s, with all the charts and rules and (later) feats and classes and specializations and all that, which it seems they feel get in the way of their freedom to have the sorts of characters they want to have, and two, a sense that simple mechanics that don't force specific sorts of role-play are good, because again, they don't get in the way of the creativity of the players or GMs.  There's also a strong sub-current that states that simple mechanics are better because they don't get in the way of playing, and are easy to use quickly.<br/><br/>I'm personally of the opinion that OSR might better be described as a minimalist movement, on some level.  That term, while descriptive, is also problematic - since there are at least two different kinds of minimalism easily available - one that's wide open (which is what OSR seems to be going for) and one that is curtailed for specific ends (which I think, in some ways, some indy games that are simple, but very specific as to what they're trying to get to, fall into).  <br/><br/>There's a bunch of stuff about the role of the GM, too, that I don't quite get yet.  Having been around during the late 70s myself, some of this may be the fact that I probably have a bunch of unexamined assumptions about how people play and GM, which means I have a hard time distinguishing the differences.<br/><br/>Like I said, just my observations here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367262/#Comment_367262" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T15:17:12+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  3:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Sometimes the players became so comfortable with the setting assumptions that it wasn't hard to figure out correct/reasonable outcomes for the setting, freeing up bandwidth for more character-driven drama.</blockquote>\nThis! This this this. <br/>Survival movies are often not really "about anything" except the very physical drama and tension of getting out of the situation alive. The main themes are betrayal and hopelessness, which mean that the characters will be bleak and the status quo changes a lot, which makes for a lot less "bandwidth" for complex moral and emotional dilemmas to develop. <br/><br/>The problem with seeking emotional depth in a traditional game of D&amp;D (wtf ever that means) is, usually, that there are no guidelines or rules for things like the PCs' emotional connections to the world around them. When you go in that direction, it's gotta come from raw acting skill - - the game provides no "net" underneath you to help you emotionally engage with the story, no guidance in that direction. It's all on you.<br/><br/>At present, I'm exploring how much moral complexity/problem-having we can wring from Dungeon World. It feels a lot like Storming the Wizard's Tower - - when you take the time to really explore the PCs' starting relationships, you will almost assuredly be drawn into a complex drama. If people have defined motivations, if they move sharply towards their goals, then the "scaffolding" provided by these details will make it easier to "get into it" and know how to make hay with that content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367339/#Comment_367339" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T19:48:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  7:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><i>Old School Roleplay</i>seems strange to me.

I would sooner direct you to read the blogs and play some games than to ask for a statement of intent from me and hope everyone agrees with it.<br/><br/>In terms of playstyle, the OSR people are far more interested in finding actual people to play with and defending the rationale behind many old practices (and saying, "Hey, there was one") than with <i>always playing games which stick to those practices.</i><br/><br/>The philosophy? Mmmmm..."These antiquated practices are not necessarily out of fashion because they suck, let's rip theses old games apart and see what we can make out of them".<br/><br/>This is probably the closest thing the OSR has to a philosophy:<br/><br/><a href="http://jrients.blogspot.com/2006/02/i-got-your-threefold-model-right-here.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jrients.blogspot.com/2006/02/i-got-your-threefold-model-right-here.html</a><br/><br/>Here is a community-built list of house-rules and gaming advice--ranging from the obscure and grognardly rules-obsessive to the wide open and weird: <br/><br/><a href="http://campaignwiki.org/wiki/LinksToWisdom/HomePage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://campaignwiki.org/wiki/LinksToWisdom/HomePage</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>_____<br/>*This seems relevant: the OSR is a literal community in the sense that people know each other and game with each other. They disagree wildly on many things and play many different games but they read many of the same blogs, appear on many of the same forums, buy many of the same products. And--most significantly--when there is a game on? Everybody can sit at the same table and know they have enough of the same assumptions that the game will roll with no agenda clash.

Therefore advocating them is a "return" in some sense.  For example, if you check discussions of D&amp;D art you'll see many people who assume <i>as a matter of course</i> that Erol Otus sucks and was a primitive artist. The idea that he drew like that for a reason and that it was a style with interesting expressive qualities is unheard of in much mainstream art discussion--therefore interest in him could be seen as a "revival" rather than a "continuation.")<br/><br/>When someone claims any of these things is Not Ok the OSR self-identifies in order to say "Hey, there's a whole community here who does this and it's fun for them and they are not insane masochists, know that" otherwise it is content to be a big tent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367379/#Comment_367379" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T01:08:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  1:08AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 1:09AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the term "School" is confusing here.<br/><br/>It has more in common with the way the word is used in the phrase "Old School Hip Hop" than "The Frankfurt School".

I mean, it's a well-known idiom, isn't it? I'm nowhere near native and I don't have trouble getting this. "Old school" means "the way things used to be done before, especially and specifically by the cultural forebears of the currently dominant paradigm". It's not like there ever was a school that is now old, literally speaking - not in hip hop, nor in roleplaying. What's more, it's obviously a relative term. I can totally say "I'm kicking it old-school over here, playing Sorcerer and Dust Devils and MLwM, not any of that foolish new stuff." I'm referring to games published in 1999-2003 ironically as the "old school" of the Forge design tradition in this sentence, but still it seems to me that I am using the language in an entirely understandable way. Could be wrong, of course.<br/><br/>Also, for what it's worth, the "renaissance" part seems entirely appropriate to me as well. I'm nothing like a "member" of this movement (if nothing else, I think that they don't allow dual citizenship in rpg tribes), but I've followed its development on and off, and from this random Internet person's viewpoint the entire trend seems exactly like a cultural renaissance. It's a small subcultural thing instead of a continent-wide revival of a thousand-year old culture, of course, but we are able to use words like this creatively, right? All I know is that in 2005 the only analytical/critical writing I'd seen that'd have considered old school D&amp;D seriously came from some Forgistas dabbling in it, and then suddenly more and more roleplayers started to vocally create high-profile (Internet-wise, that is) content, theory and tools for the game. It's been such an obviously trending thing where more and more people have played old school D&amp;D for the first time after an entire generation missed out on the experience... I don't know a better term than "renaissance" or "revival" or such. Of course there are old-timers who "never stopped", as they say, but that doesn't change the essential nature of the cultural trend: there would be nothing to discuss here were it not for the younger, new, vocal people with their new takes at old games.<br/><br/>(Zak: because I know that the above probably annoys you, I should clarify that I do not intend to imply that Ron Edwards started the OSR movement.

No need to disparage people who are interested in those things. The OSR is one of the big movements and influences in Anglo-American roleplaying right now, and ridiculing it or suggesting that there's not anything to it is ignoring the facts: it's very meaningful and significant to a lot of people and will continue to be influential and lead to new understandings of roleplaying.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, both the recent indie games movement and the OSR originally came out of frustration with late-80s and 90s games and the sense that play was getting muddy, rules texts were getting increasingly vague or mysterious (all that talk about "creating stories," with few concrete procedures), and the desire for styles of play that felt more consistent and grounded in repeatable procedures instead of unstructured improvisation and "magical GM" performances. While indie games folks moved in the direction of creating new types of games and experimenting with new styles of play, the OSR tackled the same problem by returning to older pre-"storytelling" RPGs and trying to rediscover what was good about those games. Just like in indie games, there's some posturing that goes on about certain kinds of games being objectively better or "purer" than others, but at the core it's just an attempt to have more fun and consistent play.<br/><br/>Recently there's been an increasing amount of crossover happening between indie and OSR folks.  A bunch of indie folks have written stuff for Fight On!, an OSR-oriented zine. Folks like Jason Morningstar, Ben Lehman, Luke Crane, and others have been playing Moldvay and Metzger D&amp;D. Ben's working on a semi-"old school" game called High Quality Role-Playing. Tony Dowler is all up in the early RPG vibe, both with his art and his play.  And that's just the stuff I know about, which is the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>In any event, all I'm saying is that: it's a thing, it's really happening, and it's significant right now.  You're welcome to dismiss it, but that doesn't change any of those things. People will keep writing and playing other games too, including crazy experimental stuff, but the influence of early RPGs will probably be felt in the next generation of games to emerge from places like SG and the Forge, even more than it already has (Drowning and Falling, How to Host a Dungeon, Storming the Wizard's Tower, S/Lay w/ Me, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367474/#Comment_367474" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T08:52:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  8:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread diverged, but earlier you were talking about gamism and how the OSR is kinda-sorta-a-little-bit like it.<br/>But where did the concept of \xbbgamism\xab in RPG come from if not from old D&amp;D?<br/>That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always read it.<br/>That\u2019s not to say, of course, that D&amp;D can\u2019t be other things too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367481/#Comment_367481" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T09:12:49+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  9:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 9:13AM by Tavis.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>The OSR is one of the big movements and influences in Anglo-American roleplaying right now</blockquote>\nI think the Anglo-American thing is important. My family travels overseas a lot for conferences my wife attends, and I try to meet gamers wherever we wind up. The difference between local scenes is huge - the guys I talked to in Poland were very happy with what sounded to me like 90s style play in which they would write multiple page backstories for their lovingly detailed characters and then expect the GM to weave all these together using no tools beyond those offered in trad games that were big over here in the US back then, like 7th Sea or the L5R RPG. Lots of things that I saw as fundamentally important to the state of the art in RPGs, like organized play or indie games or the OSR, were based on assumptions that just didn't matter to those guys.<br/><br/>Differences between scenes happen within even the same city - I didn't get to meet juliusz while I was in Krakow, but I know he's a local very interested in indie and OSR stuff - but the US/UK market is unified enough that movements in different places are often reacting to the same thing. The OSR isn't just about D&amp;D, but because it's the Anglo-American 800 pound gorilla there's no doubt that the changes in the approach seen in D&amp;D's recent editions are going to produce meaningful and significant reactions. If you never cared about D&amp;D, or about what was published as the official version of a big-tent RPG that was a lingua franca for most every gamer you'd ever meet, then the OSR still might be interesting to you as a source of techniques and ideas but you won't get what it means as a movement to people coming from that background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367482/#Comment_367482" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T09:14:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  9:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 9:20AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 2097</cite>This thread diverged, but earlier you were talking about gamism and how the OSR is kinda-sorta-a-little-bit like it.<br/>But where did the concept of \xbbgamism\xab in RPG come from if not from old D&amp;D?<br/>That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always read it.<br/>That\u2019s not to say, of course, that D&amp;D can\u2019t be other things too.</blockquote>\n"Gamism" is not a term I recognize as making a lot of sense.<br/><br/>"Challenge-oriented play" is a major part of the OSR, but the idea of single-agenda focused play is, as I said on page one, not so big in the OSR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367484/#Comment_367484" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T09:19:19+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  9:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I could never identify with a school of thought that makes popular ideas into gospel.<br/></blockquote>\nClearly if you think there's a "gospel" you didn't even identify the words that I typed.<br/><br/>There's a major difference between "several people having arrived (independently) at the conclusion that they all like pizza" and "claiming everyone should like pizza because Jesus".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367485/#Comment_367485" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T09:23:33+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  9:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 9:23AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>"Gamism" is not a term I recognize as making a lot of sense.</blockquote>Hi Zak!

AD&amp;D; was all about adding more rules to your game, likely as a side effect of becoming a business and needing to sell (and seeing a demand for) new product.  Call of Cthulhu sure had a lot of character skills and less reliance on player skill.  Champions and gurps added complexity and balance to character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of empathy for most of the things the OSR puts forth as ideas and love when they detail specific ways to get a solid playstyle for your game such as they've done with D&amp;D.;  I grew weary of the extended source books and new kit books and guide to this clan book or that splatbook we saw in the 90's and later.  I think the idea of role playing is pretty simple and the more rules and complexity added dont tend to make a better game.  My best games were almost entirely freeform with vague descriptions of abilities and characteristics and we'd just make rulings based on what we thought would happen.  That makes me question why they've kept some of the rules they've decided to hold on to though, they seem to be more nostalgia or familiarity than providing anything useful.  I dont think the D&amp;D; experience would be harmed if you dialed it back, got rid of the classes and levels just built characters based on what happens in play or where they spend the xp they gain.

The OSR seemed to really gain steam through the 3.5/4E period, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>It's notable that, just because the OSR and recent indie movement started as a reaction against late-80s and 90s games (or 00s D&amp;D), that doesn't mean there's nothing awesome or valuable about those games.  I mean, the 80s-90s were themselves a reaction against a lot of "stupid" stuff about early D&amp;D ("meaningless" character death, 10-foot-poles, etc.). And, as Joe McDaldno has said, there will doubtlessly be a "Second Wave Renaissance" a few years from now, if it isn't already happening.  Apocalypse World is already kinda in that vein, with it's non-OS sandbox-style play more reminiscent of Shadowrun and Vampire.<br/><br/>All of which is to say: <b>rethinking and reexamining older game texts or play styles that may or may not have initially made sense to you is <i>just as valuable a way to broaden your understanding and appreciation or roleplaying</i> as playing experimental or new stuff.</b> And the OSR is contributing to that in a major way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367508/#Comment_367508" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T10:02:04+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 10:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Jonathan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367510/#Comment_367510" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T10:02:53+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 10:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 10:14AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: J.

Hence the detailed investigations into "how it was done" so many years ago, and mining those experiences for techniques and playstyle which may have been "lost" to the mainstream.<br/><br/>Is there some truth to my guess?</blockquote>\nThis resonates with my understanding as well. But the OSR community also seems to have widened it's view beyond just originally white box-based play or Mentzer box-based play, to look at other "root" games: 1e AD&amp;D, Traveller (Classic), Gamma World, Starships &amp; Spacemen, RuneQuest II.<br/><br/>I think you have something that one of the reasons that OSR latched so solidly onto the "original D&amp;D" root material rather than the other root games that were prevalent at the time lies in the (current) tension between that root material and its fan-base and the current incarnation of that gaming heritage in 3.x/PFRP and 4e and the "old guard's" disquiet with it. But I also think that the OSR's efforts have reached a bit of a new audience, as well -- Zak's own efforts include people with little or no "old guard" experience if I read his reports correctly, and I think that's important -- OSR is not necessarily just a rockabilly nostalgia for ducks, leather jackets, and Gretches -- there are new people being drawn into these games and having fun, too.

AFAIK, Ron's essays suggest that players move between creative agendas all the time, that it's relatively rare and unlikely (even in more focused indie games that are designed to support particular styles of play) that everyone's always doing the same thing, all the way through a campaign. That's why you don't classify specific games or instances of play according to CAs.  It just doesn't make sense to think of them that way. Instead, you use CAs to examine long swaths of play (generally involving multiple sessions) and suggest what your play of the game was, in general, about. So you can choose to intentionally focus on a specific CA from the beginning, but that's not necessarily what you're going to end up exhibiting, and play itself is going to vary significantly, even in situations where -- over time -- you exhibit one CA or another.<br/><br/>This has been a public service announcement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367621/#Comment_367621" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:01:20+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard that description before Jonathan but it sounds kind of wishy washy to me even if it's mostly right.  The way I look at it is by looking at the big model with social contract in the outermost ring, CA is an arrow that goes down through it.  That's the significant part.  It's a social agreement on what the game is about and how it's played, it provides a workable frame for how the players will interact with each other but it doesnt govern the minutia of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a gm is running in a "challenge based" fashion he knows he needs to create situations that are challenging to the players and the players know they need to be ready to respond to the challenges.   That doesnt mean they have to be prepared to die every second of every game, nor does it necessarily preclude them building some depth into the character by adding facets that pertain to things beyond the challenge of the game.  Those things just may not be handled as in depth as the challenge of the game is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you cant really have is someone thinking that the game is being played in a power gaming fashion while someone else thinks the game is challenge based.  The power gamer expects the gm to be lobbing up softballs so they can knock them out of the park while someone expecting challenge can get bored if there is none.  Either they adjust and accept the way the game is being played or drop out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367639/#Comment_367639" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:39:37+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 2:41PM by Teataine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes and yes to both of the above.

I think there's an additional observation that Ron didn't quite make at the time, because he presupposes a super-democratic level of organization. Games with a strong GM role (and thus a more asymmetrical setup) are easier to manage across agendas because it's the GM that sets the agenda of a particular game (by creating responses to the player actions), and as long as they have one player working with them, it clicks. Players who don't click with the primary agenda are promoted to a sort of co-GM/pseudo NPC status that supports what the others are doing.<br><br>But this is way offtopic at this point.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367645/#Comment_367645" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:48:24+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Yes and yes to both of the above.

storygames is even worse than rpg.net for discussing Story Now or any other Creative Agenda (or any kind of Forge Theory). If someone ask something about that, he always get a long pointless thread full of flames, posturing, people ranting against Ron Edwards, the Forge or the idea that system matter, and a lot of really confusing and contradictory definitions about what theory terms mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the other hand, "OSR" can really mean anything, in Big Model terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he question at the base of this thread is "this undefined thing can be compatible with something that most of you don't know what it is?".  And chaos ensues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the thread opener is still interested in his question, my suggestion is to drop both "OSR" and "story now" and simply use a couple practical examples about what he wants: "I like to play like this, but I want to get this, it's possible to get both at the same time?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is interested in learning what the Big Model really say, I suggest instead that he follow the advice lumpley gave him <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=366900" rel="nofollow">a lot of post above.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367813/#Comment_367813" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T06:07:09+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  6:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deliverator: So what happens, I propose, is that every given group playing D&amp;D is going to (a) figure out which side of the line they prefer, and play there; (b) wander back and forth across the line seamlessly, as Zak says (the old Forge idea of the "instance of play" is useful here); or (c) get all muddled up by the line, and not be able to figure out why sometimes the game's fun and sometimes it isn't.<br><br>So yeah, a local play culture of type (a) where "D&amp;D players aren't interested in morality in gaming," totally happens.

People who play games are pretty good at learning to know what kind of games they like and don't like, what kind of play style they like, and don't like. Sometimes, they're not, and then sometimes they seek to find out why by asking or learning. Sometimes they just stop and do something else with their time.<br/><br/>On your second point, I wouldn't necessarily say "Woe".
