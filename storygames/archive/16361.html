Like the gun on the mantle going off in act three: you take old info (there is a gun on the mantlepiece) and new info (the gun is loaded and prone to misfire) and produce a new revelation (the gun goes off).<br/><br/>How does this jive with the recent dogma of "play to find out what happens?" Not well. For one, a plot twist needs closure to carry any weight. What I mean by that is that there needs to be a sense that there is more to the fiction than the audience currently knows. Otherwise, the audience gets a sense of "The writers totally just pulled that out of their ass." But in collaborative storytelling, the audience is writing the story, and writers are their own audience!<br/><br/>The only solution I know of is to keep secrets. This is not usually welcome because it means that some players are establishing fiction without the other's knowledge or consent, and forcing them to play along with it.<br/><br/>Can a twist be just as satisfying without it being built up to and pre-established? Are there games I don't know about that handle this really well? Am I an idiot for wondering all of this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373636/#Comment_373636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T10:19:32+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 10:19AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One piece of advice in Play Unsafe is to be obvious.

Players have lots of narrative power and the GM was often just laying back and responding to our creativity.  What was amazing is that we automatically tended to incorporate existing elements in our narration and at one point we fully closed the loop saying.. OH, THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED! except that we just made it up... but it didn't feel like we made it up, more like we uncovered it, even if.. we just made it up :-)<br/><br/>I don't know how else to describe this phenomenon, or if it is repeatable, but it seems to happen quite naturally, as if we always tried -as player- to reach closure by putting together existing narrative element.

Microscope, for instance, gives the lens player extra opportunities to contribute and the lens can use that to build up and deliver twists that address their focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373650/#Comment_373650" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T11:54:42+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 11:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, these answers really made me think.

Having the GM spring surprises on the other players is one of the great things that they can do.<br/><br/>As with all story games, the shadow of gonzo is always lurking in the wings and it takes players with good story awareness to avoid such pitfalls. Having one player responsible for overall narrative gives a continuity of narrative which is harder to arrive at with more players. That said, when it does happen, it's magical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373782/#Comment_373782" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T03:31:13+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  3:31AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Play Unsafe also talks about accidental reintegration.

Maybe Ninjas attack out of nowhere, or just..whatever is going to get the PCs to set new goals.  And theres no reason behind it, its just some shit that happens.  But you dont forget it.  Sometime  latter, something else happens that naturally leads to an 'aha' moment that you didnt plan.  Oh, so THATS why the ninajs attacked - of course. <br/><br/>Or maybe he called it 'reverse foreshadowing' or something, but you get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373791/#Comment_373791" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T06:25:08+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  6:25AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely know players who find that the story-game "oh, so that's what *really* happened" thing is deeply unsatisfying since it didn't actually come from anyone's prior planning. OTOH, as others have said upthread, when it happens in a GM-less or low-prep game where everyone is really on board, it can be great. Games that can do this well that I've played include Sign in Stranger, A Taste For Murder, 1,001 Nights, PsiRun, carry, shock:, and InSpectres.<br/><br/>But, there are S-G darlings that can deliver more traditional plot twists pretty nicely. AW and its siblings are at the top of my personal list (though I haven't played the Icelanders one, I have found that AW itself, DW, and Monster of the Week all have nice "GM hides some info and reveals it in play" stuff), but Mouse Guard and even core Burning Wheel can do this as well. Time and Temp and Dogs in the Vineyard, as well as others I'm sure I'm forgetting, also have the idea of investigating a GM-prepped situation built in. But note Dogs' dictum to "actively reveal the town in play"\u2014the plot twists can and should be both surprising and non-improvised, but you don't generally have to wait very long to find them out.<br/><br/>And I think that's where the Forge//indie/hippie/swine/focused/etc games differ from traditional play: even when there are genuine secret plot twists, you generally don't have to wait a dozen sessions to find out the secret; at most one or two.<br/><br/>My understanding is that old-school play contrasts with both other traditions in how it handles secret information. Since the GM is not supposed to have either a plot agenda or a moral/dramatic one, he's unlikely to develop a lot of secrets with the purpose of revealing them. But the nature of old-school scenarios is such that there are many secrets, and whether none or all of them or (more likely) some amount in between are discovered in play is one of the things you play to find out. Furthermore, random table generation of fictional elements may imply some sort of hidden info scenarios, but again, there's no agenda in play on the part of the GM other than impartiality.<br/><br/>A relevant anecdote: I recently ran a LARP for my college gaming group. Traditionally, this group has had big spill sessions after these types of game where you "find out what's really going on." One of my co-GMs, a more experienced LARP GM than I, is extremely resistant to this tradition. Her reasoning is that if there's something really awesome about your character that you want to see the other players respond to with surprise, it has to come out during the game. I couldn't agree more, and feel that this decision enhanced our players' experience considerably.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373804/#Comment_373804" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T07:45:06+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  7:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Werewolf LARP for like 3 or 4 years, and one of my favorite parts was bringing back old characters as new villains, or revealing that a new conflict was actually rooted in an old grudge.  <br/><br/>I think these kinds of twists are great when they enhance player agency.  I love it when I find out that the whole world is interacting and moving around me, and I've encountered important people and places before.<br/><br/>However, I think that twists can rob players of their own ability to affect the world.  It's exciting when you find out that Darth Vader is your father; it sucks to learn that nothing in the current conflict matters because some powerful NPC resolved it 15 years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
