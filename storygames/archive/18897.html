It didn't occur to me in the setup session, but on reflection it seems that we may have made a mistake in not having more male characters, either PCs or NPC family members. We've got all kinds of interesting Threats lying around, and if this were Apocalypse World I'd be good to go, but I'm struggling to pull them together in ways that evoke the setting \u2013 which is the reason we're playing this game instead of AW, you know? It's probably my lack of familiarity with the source material, but I'm finding it especially difficult to pull in issues of honor and shame as per one of the ceremonial moves.<br/><br/>For those of you who know the game and the sagas better than I do, what sort of issues might crop up for independent women landholders, ones who don't have husbands and don't intend ever to have them? I can provide more context if that helps, but I figured I'd start out asking for general ideas and moving on to specifics.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422754/#Comment_422754" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-11T13:33:26+00:00" title="October 11, 2013  1:33PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2013 1:33PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are other people in the community, right? Other men and women, jarls and huscarls, etc. I think generally any Icelandic community would be tight-knit, and regardless of whether these two characters marry, they'll need people to help them farm, trade, and protect themselves from outlaws and powerful neighbors. The Sei\xf0kona might see things coming and need to convince or trick others (leaders, warriors, etc.) to act.  Likewise the Shield-Maiden will be concerned with defending her family and may be as concerned about honor as any man, and will react to challenges from NPCs accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422756/#Comment_422756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-11T16:05:20+00:00" title="October 11, 2013  4:05PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other men might lean on the brother to marry early or take charge or set them up with an older sister or extortion or romance or recrutement or faith.

It isn't entirely their call, unless they say fuck you to their entire clan, which is a nice conflict engine in itself.<br/><br/>If your Sei\u2202kona is working forbidden magic, structure a threat to have her brought to the quarter court and put on trial, where she will be judged by men and require a man to advocate for her. Tie this advocacy to marriage in a quid-pro-quo sort of familial deal, or into the drowning pool she goes. <br/><br/>Do your players care about honor? If not, just drop that thread from a female-intensive game. If so, encourage your Shield Maiden to take the honor-related basic male move as an advance, problem solved (created!). She's in a great position regardless to take on male-associated obligations, like helping revenge a murdered cousin or serving as mediator or diplomat between Go\u2202is.<br/><br/>Do they have a male relative who is now (or is suddenly!) a widower? That guy will want an unmarried female cousin to come help out with his motherless children, and run his farm while he goes raiding. <br/><br/>Do you have a Go\u2202i who might hear from the Gods that Freya has abandoned the Shield Maiden and that she needs to start having babies and marriages and being a good daughter? Obviously this isn't his call and he's making it up but he's the boss and people listen.<br/><br/>The particular saga you should be reading right now is Laxdaela.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422810/#Comment_422810" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T20:06:32+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  8:06PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything posted above: Yes.<br/><br/>And here would be my entry point:<br/><br/>What do the Players care about that the Characters care about? (In that weird twilight between fiction and what we, as people, get caught up in the fiction.)<br/><br/>Their land? Surviving? Their crops? Children or parents or siblings who are infirm or someone?<br/><br/>In other words, not to focus on threats yet, but what could be threatened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay. Threaten that. Or whatever matters to them.<br/><br/>From what I've gotten in your first post what matters is:<br/>1) Their land.<br/>2) Their independence.<br/>(Awesome, by the way.)<br/><br/>Okay, threaten that.<br/><br/>Raiders. Evil spirits ruining crops. Caught in the cross-fire of two warring parties that she wants nothing to do with but is fucking up her life. <br/><br/>Right there, three things threatening her land. How does she respond? I have no idea, but she's got moves that could lead her to negotiate with the trouble makers, or shame a man into fighting on her behalf, or summon aid from supernatural places.<br/><br/>Or say there's a man who wants to marry one of them. (Or several men!.) The men in the Sagas can get pretty obsessive about women. What does she do about that? Does she court another man and have them fight each other -- which leads the families to blame her when the men die... and so on?<br/><br/>In short: I don't ever think (and this for me) there are ever threats "out there"... there are only threats (or Threats, in the technical sense, for AW games) if they actually ping to things that matter to the Player Character, as defined as mattering to the Player. Not in an intellectual, "This makes sense for the setting way," but, "No, my Woman is never going to marry, because I want my woman to live free!" kind of way.<br/><br/>Now, this means you have to have players who aren't upset you're pining them with trouble about the things that matter to them. I've noticed some people freak out about this, some people relish it. But I don't know how you don't play games like this without this being part of what the fun is about. (As a Player I relish this. I will tell my GM early on, if new to these kinds of games, "I care very much about <i>this</i>. Please make sure to hit me hard about this thing.")<br/><br/>So, that's how I'd start looking at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422824/#Comment_422824" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T04:55:55+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  4:55AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2013 4:57AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher's post inspired another super obvious threat angle - the outlawed relative, a perennial saga favorite. It is illegal to harbor a full outlaw, but if the full outlaw is kin to deny them hospitality is perhaps a greater stain on your family honor. People will be looking for the outlaw because they want to kill him. If they find him on your land, that's problematic for everyone. <br/><br/>A lesser outlaw needs a place to (legally) hide out for three years and if he's your cousin you can hardly deny him, can you? <br/><br/>Both of these situations will bend the game toward legal disputes, and the penalties <i>start </i>with the forfeiture of land and may go to some very bad places from there. People who get outlawed tend to be shit-heels as well, although sometimes they are sympathetic dudes who got framed or acted out of noble passion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422826/#Comment_422826" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T07:16:50+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  7:16AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Laxdaela rocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
