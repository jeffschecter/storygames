Example include:\n<ul>\n<li>Appropriate Skill (e.g. Management to suck-up to briefing officer)</li>\n<li>Relevant Service Group (e.g. R&amp;D to reprogram a bot)</li>\n<li>Special knowledge (e.g. Blackmail material on PLC clerk)</li>\n<li>Special equipment (e.g. BFG when firing on Commies)</li>\n<li>Appropriate drugs (e.g. Happy Life to pass Happiness Officer review)</li>\n<li>Secret Society aid (e.g. Calling in an IOU from Death Leopard to blow a power relay)</li>\n<li>Mutant Power (e.g. Using Adhesion to climb a sheer wall)</li>\n<li>Whenever the GM feels like it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When something seriously compromises your effectiveness, gain a penalty die. Examples include:\n<ul>\n<li>When injured (e.g. climbing with a broken arm)</li>\n<li>When drugged (e.g. Standing guard OD\u2019d on Sleepy-Time pills)</li>\n<li>When lacking crucial information (e.g. cutting the red wire while color blind)</li>\n<li>Whenever the GM feels like it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bonus and penalty dice cancel each other on a one-for-one basis</li>\n<li>Roll the total number of dice</li>\n<li>Assign a die result to the goal and to each danger to find out what happens</li>\n<li>If there are any bonus dice in the pool, assign any dice of your choice first and discard the extra</li>\n<li>If there are any penalty dice in the pool, assign all the lowest dice first and discard the extra</li>\n</ul><del></del><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goals and Dangers</span><br/>Goals And Dangers are always based on the specifics of the action.

During any future dice roll, you or the GM can add that danger to the roll (instead of the danger you would normally have the opportunity to add).<br/><br/>When your goal could be treasonous or is accomplished by treasonous means (e.g. use information above your security clearance, lie to Friend Computer, use a mutant power, etc), add the danger \u201cTreason.\u201d<br/>When you use your Mutant Power, add the danger \u201cMutant Power Mishap.\u201d<br/>When you request help from your Secret Society, add the danger \u201cSecret Society Mishap.\u201d<br/>When you use special or experimental equipment, add the danger \u201cEquipment Mishap.\u201d<br/>When you use drugs, add the danger \u201cMedication Mishap.\u201d<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390310/#Comment_390310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T19:13:55+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  7:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continues...<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal</span><br/>1: \u201cCitizen, You have been fined [INTEGER OVERFLOW] credits for damaging Computer property.\u201d<br/>2: \u201cPlease cease all activity until you have an approved R-U-A-T8R form.

Immediately addictive.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creating Troubleshooters</span><br/>Choose one skill to receive a bonus die to all actions. Choose a different skill to receive a penalty die to all actions.  Then for each remaining skill choose a two different specialties, one to receive a bonus die and one to receive a penalty die. Note everyone receives a bonus die for the Violence specialty Energy &amp; Projectile Weapons by default (but you may still choose it to receive a further penalty die or bonus die, canceling or doubling its value; it also adds or cancels if the Violence skill is chosen to always receive a bonus or penalty die).<br/><br/>I'm not going to post any more details on Troubleshooter creation (skills, mutations, secret societies, service groups, etc) because those details are easily available in any of the legacy or current editions of Paranoia.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other types of Danger it might be fun to create lists for</span><br/>Bureaucracy<br/>PLC Request<br/>R&amp;D or Service Services<br/>IntSec Interrogation<br/>Vulture Warriors<br/>Accuse Traitor / Report Treason<br/>Hygiene<br/>Happiness<br/><br/>I'm planning on running this soon but I hope it proves useful to others as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390311/#Comment_390311" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T20:09:32+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  8:09PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2012 8:10PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome...<br/><br/>I think I may have to play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390350/#Comment_390350" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T14:14:50+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  2:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
