This leads to my obvious, first bit of advice:<br/><br/><b>* Plan to do any setup, prep, world building, or situation generation when everyone is online.</b><br/>At the rate we're going, it will take us about a week--or more--to get to the First Scene.<br/><br/><b>* Maintain clean "state waves."</b><br/>We haven't gotten far enough into it to be sure, but I suspect that having a single wave for reference to things like character details, NPCs, places, etc is best, if only for speed of access. Trying to do so within a larger, narrative wave will be a disaster.<br/><br/><b>* Kill waves with rancor and relish.</b><br/>In the 24 hours mentioned above, we've generated 125 posts with about 250 edits; and the wave for "OOC chatter" is already at a crawl, with only seven participants. I am hoping we can keep it for clarification through Fiasco setup... and then Archive it mercilessly, to make a new OOC wave for each subsequent play stage: Act I OOC discussion, the Tilt mechanics and selections, Act II OCC discussions, and the Aftermath mechanics. I *hope* to have a single narrative wave, if only so that the full story is readable (and copyable and bloggable) without a lot of clicking... but I suspect it will become unwieldy, too, and we'll end up chunking by Act I, Act II, and Aftermath narration.<br/><br/><b>Provide prompts in narration waves.</b><br/>I'm going to try this (sometime in December, at this rate!), but the gist is to setup a prompt for the PC that you are 'targeting' or from which you expect a reply, the better to inform its player that the Talking Stick is in his or her hands. This will be particularly important for dialog (which I shudder to imagine). Which reminds me:<br/><br/><b>* Frame dialog intent and tone in the OOC wave.</b><br/>Brian (fnord) and I are thinking of ways to present 'plans' for dialog in the OOC wave, the better to drive it forward in a post-a-day pace, to avoid the situation where a real-time conversation of ten minutes (i.e. about fifteen exchanges, if 'heated') doesn't take half a month to play out, while all other PCs twiddle their thumbs. To that end:<br/><br/><b>* Parallel scenes, when there's no chance of cross-over.</b><br/>We'll see if Fiasco supports this--I don't see why not, until we're down to a handful of dice to give, which would impact the turn-order allocation of choice of positive or negative scene resolution (i.e. when there's only one black or white die left; there could be an OOC conflict about who gets the last one, the freedom to choose the very last die notwithstanding). But I can imagine some games working fine with simultaneity (e.g. Diplomacy, of course... but that's not nearly as interactive 'at the table' as an RPG, since many negotiations can take place through email or chat or offline).<br/><br/><b>* Take you time, when you are online.</b><br/>It can be weird to watch someone type, anticipate their message, try to answer, which makes them edit, which makes you reply... all in two blips. Waiting for a clear ending seems to help with the coherence of a wave.<br/><br/>Anyone else finding tricks or techniques to manage play-by-wave?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241917/#Comment_241917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T19:25:55+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  7:25PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think it's important to take advantage of the... advantages Wave offers.  Parallel scenes, are a good example. (not that you can't do that in play by chat or play by forum, but it may be easier on Wave).  Ben Lehman suggested it to me when I was asking him about a Polaris game I'm trying to get going over Wave.  It wasn't something that had occurred to me at ALL until then!  But, if we're careful, in a game like Polaris, it may very well be possible to have all 4 "current" Heart scenes going at the same time!  The issue there will be ensuring that people don't get confused about what role they have in each individual wave.  And, of course, causality issues if not all the scenes are taking place at the same time.<br/><br/>I also agree that parceling things out into multiple waves is crucial.  There's almost no way you're going to want both the chatter ABOUT chargen AND the character sheets in one wave, for example, unless you go back and delete all the chatter afterward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241926/#Comment_241926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T23:38:43+00:00" title="November 13, 2009 11:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I also agree that parceling things out into multiple waves is crucial.

I think large hard drives and vast inboxes have made us hesitant to delete anything (while entire serials of early Doctor Who were recorded over to save tape).  Wave still archives everything through playback, so I think deleting comments aggressively as they become irrelevant may be useful to managing high use waves.  I say aggressively because we may have some hesitation, as mentioned, but also as we may fear to hurt peoples' feelings for deleting their comments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241931/#Comment_241931" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-14T03:16:44+00:00" title="November 14, 2009  3:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Agree upon how often one should check out the Wave BEFORE starting play</b><br/><br/>Make sure that everyone agrees on how often the Wave should be read and responded to.<br/><br/>We started a Burning Empires game and I am feeling some mild frustration over the fact that I can read/update the Wave twenty times a day and another player only can do that every other day or so.<br/><br/>Also, we're still in World Burning, and there is chatter about each question, but once we agree someone extracts the important stuff and rewrites it into a singe blip and then we purge the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241935/#Comment_241935" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-14T06:12:28+00:00" title="November 14, 2009  6:12AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone tried <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL8584028M/Code_of_Unaris" rel="nofollow">Code of Unaris</a> for Wave?

Have you tried it?  I suspect that since, as you point out, everything is still in the playback, a wave that used to be huge but had many blips deleted, will still become very, very slow.  But I also haven't tried it, so I can't be sure.  Partially I haven't tried it because of the etiquette issue.

One nice thing about Wave is that both are possible.  For example, I'm in the game of Fiasco David started and while we don't really intend to try to coordinate time to be on together, this morning we all were there at once and we were able to go back and forth very easily to blaze through most of the set-up.<br/><br/>I'm not a PbP expert at all, but I suspect that detailed dialog would suffer similar problems to extensive combat.  If you're doing a lot of back-and-forth true "dialog" conversation and the people involved aren't either online at the same time or at least checking wave frequently throughout the day, it's going to crawl.<br/><br/>I think one "type" of game that would work well in Wave are those in which it's okay for multiple scenes to be going on simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241974/#Comment_241974" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-14T14:59:14+00:00" title="November 14, 2009  2:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a Google Doc for how I'd like to run my Dungeon Squad game.

We use a single wave for a scene and open wavelets up within that wave when we need to introduce the mechanical element of the game. Dice rolls, player chat, stake negotiation and setting all occur within a single hideable wavelet at the point of crisis in the narration. Once that has been resolved, the wavelet is closed and play continues. Works well when people know how to open and edit a single wavelet rather than simply replying ad nasuem and creating organisational chaos.<br/><br/><b>We need to get rid of pointless waves.</b><br/><br/>It's only a small 2 player + 1 GM game, but we've created enough waves that its taking on the appearance of an ocean. Just finding what you want is becoming a major PITA. Culling frequently and brutally may resolve this.<br/><br/><b>Differentiating players</b><br/><br/>We use different colour fonts for each player, with the GM having black type. This makes keeping things organized within the narrative structure quite easy.<br/><br/><b>Wetiquette</b><br/><br/>It gets bloody crazy once players start reacting to what the GM or another player is writing within the story. Responses start flying and as remarks are added the other people start changing their entries in response. I'm quite in favour of playing as you would face to face, with politeness. Let the GM establish what's happening and then respond. It can get quite frustrating otherwise. <br/><br/>I am however, despite the comments above, thoroughly enjoying myself and GW facilitates this sort of collaborative play and will definately continue. It's not like I'm throwing up my arms in dispair or disgust and walking away. I want to crack on and keep playing.<br/><br/>John<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
