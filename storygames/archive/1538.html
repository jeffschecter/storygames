                    Do you ever go back to games you used to play before you discovered indie games, and if so, do you approach them in a different manner? Are they more fun now? Less? What has changed?<br/>
<br/>
I've read quite a couple of threads recently basically saying, "We're playing D&amp;D as a tactical minis game nowadays, and it's great fun." In a similar vein, I participated in a nostalgic game of  "The Dark Eye" (Germany's D&amp;D, roughly speaking) at a small con a few months ago. We stripped the game to the most basic rules - and to the "core story" as well, namely, dungeon - hacking and levelling. <br/>
<br/>
I think the single one difference to my earlier experiences with the game which made this so much more fun was that we did not expect the game to deliver anything else besides what the rules *said* it was trying to accomplish, and, what's more, we stuck to what the rules stated explicitly. We played exactly by the book. <br/>
<br/>
So instead of coming to the table with a strong idea of what kind of game we were going to be in and what would feel right or wrong, we went by the rules and saw where that took us. <br/>
<br/>
We especially ignored any implicit rules from the fluff text, which TDE abounds with. The game conveys a very strong impression of what "good roleplaying" should look like, which is never actually covered by any rules, but nevertheless tends to have a huge impact on the way the game is usually played by the fanbase. Your're expected to stay in -character as much as possible, for example, and make in - game decisions solely based on in-character knowledge and motivations. Gaming for advancement, reward or, well, fun, is strongly discouraged and sneered upon thorughout the rulebooks. Consequently, the GM is implicitly instructed to hand out as few goodies as possible. Magic items and such are supposed to be very rare, and characters should advance in level slowly and painfully. This implict rule becomes all the more obnoxious because the setting is described as being full of magical wonders and great heroes at the same time, and the explicit rules cover almost nothing outside of combat and magical feats. We ignored all that.<br/>
<br/>
We started in the dungeon. The GM simply told us we were there - the rules said he had the right to determine things like that, and after all, everything on our charcter sheets pointed to battles and dungeoneering, so why not have some. It never crossed our minds to object. I mean, we wouldn't have objected to playing on a board in any board game, right? We used our abilities to the max, and the GM handed out rewards constantly: XP, treasures, cool items - after all, there was no explicit rules to keep him from doing that, but there *was* an advancement table. By the end of the game after about two ours we had reached level five. In an "ordinary" game of TDE, it would have taken us a couple of months to get there.<br/>
<br/>
We DID make up one rule of our own, though. Whenever we would level up, we would re - draw our character portraits to accurately mimic the increase in power. I played a wizard, and made his hat and staff a little bigger in the portrait each time he went up a level. The dwarven fighter got a bigger axe and helmet and clunkier armor each time. Exactly the sort of fun play and reveling in one's own power the implict rules discourage.<br/>
<br/>
What we got, overall, was a fun, slightly absurd, highly illogical dungeon romp. Not something I'd like to play every other week, but decidedly more fun than every other experience I've had with the game. <br/>
<br/>
Playing by the rules, expecting the rules to be meaningful and driving the game, being open about where the game takes me, not being ashamed of my own fun - yes, that's definitely something I learned out of indie gaming. So how about you?                </div>

Yes, I do. I'm playing CoC, James Bond 007 and a very old - school Spanish game of spies with psych powers named Mutants in Shadows. And they're a metric ton of fun more than before, because I feel that I understand the game a whole lot better and use it better. My appreciation of all games has grown.                        </div>

                            Do I go back? All the time. Greater awareness of what the games I'm playing are really about, greater awareness of what I want out of a game, like you, both help me enjoy whatever it is I'm playing a lot more. With some good discussion beforehand with the group, there isn't a single game on my shelf I wouldn't still play, assuming everyone understand what they're signing up for. <br/><br/>We just wrapped a game a game of 2300AD, I've played Ghostbusters this year, as well as some other old stuff. I find that as my understanding of my own gaming style improves, so do the games we have at the table.                        </div>

                            My wife and I play <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> occasionally, but we call it playing Beat Em Up.  We only create characters and engage in one-on-one fights, because those are the parts of the game that are fun.  Now, unlike your experience with TDE, TMNT has a whole lot of rules for other stuff that we completely ignore.  We have all sorts of skills that don't matter.  We roll attributes and laugh because they have no effect on game play.  So maybe it's just because TMNT is not as coherent a design, but we have to do a large chunk of editing before we have fun play.  That said, as a create-mutants-and-fight system, TMNT is tons of fun.                        </div>

                            Interestingly enough, I rarely go back to old games. Not because I hate them or anything, it's just that there's so much new shit that it's hard to be on track to play it while still accomidating the old shit.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I find myself frustrated that I don't get a chance to play old games. I would give my left eye (not really) to run a full-on campaign of OD&amp;D, actually using the rules as written. As written, there's a lot of neat stuff there to jazz up play.                        </div>

                            I've gone back to mainstream games for sure. Dogs in the Vinyard just didn't cut it for our group. And it simply comes down to I haven't seen a solid indie entrant for something D&amp;D-like with tactical minis style combat.<br/><br/>Of course everything I've learned from the indie community has changed my outlook on D&amp;D (actually Arcana Evolved).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            I've always gone by the idea that sticking to rules or explicitly house-ruling was the only 'fair' thing to do. That was something I recognised in, rather than learnt through, the Forgista games.<br/><br/>What I have got out of (some of) these games is rules that get closer to the things I want out of RPGs. So in fact, it's fairly difficult for me to return to playing a lot of stuff I have played in the past. Like Andy, I'm looking forward too much to the future.                        </div>

                            It's interesting, though, that although indie gaming has a lot to do with conscious application of rules in order to focus the gaiming experience for me, it's also about what you might call social rules, a way of interaction, like "Cool, I can be with people and we can have fun together in this meaningful, respectful manner". Social contract issues were never even on my radar back when. So today, even when I play a game that doesn't have, say, scene framing rules, I don't just sit there while the game slides off into some random direction. Instead I say "Hey, why don't we do a different scene, this doesn't rock for me". And I expect everybody else to do the same.<br/>
So maybe I only replaced TDE's set of implict rules with another. Or maybe it's just like, y'know, growing up?                        </div>

Well, I'd say I discovered indie games in 1994 or so with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theatrix</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fudge</span>.  And I pretty commonly have gone back and played prior games like James Bond 007, Champions, and GURPS. Right now I'm playing in one indie game (Amber Diceless) and game-mastering one non-indie (Call of Cthulhu), plus various other play.  <br/><br/>I think my shift at that time was more to tinker with designs in more of a systematic way.  Since hanging out at the Forge, though, I've shifted to playing games more as-written -- as a way of studying and critiquing the game design.                        </div>
