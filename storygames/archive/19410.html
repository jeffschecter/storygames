Events were broken down to a series of tasks - each with a probability roll. To succeed in a task you needed to pass each roll. This usually meant playing to your strengths and avoiding your weaknesses because failed rolls were fatal. If the odds of success were not 66% or better, there was no point in doing the action. So in effect this world view says don't take chances, do what is tried and true. It works out in the game because you are super humans. In real life it works out differently.<br/><br/>So in my real life, my assessment of myself was that not only was I not a super human but that I was in fact weak in soooo many ways. So what were the odds that the most beautiful woman I met to go out with me be? Very low, so don't try. (Actually in college I intentionally tried anyway, met three beautiful women and learned I had nothing in common with them. Interesting experience.) Applied to game making, I could ask myself "What are the odds that I'll make the next D+D?" Very low in sooo many ways, so don't try.<br/><br/>Now Possibility thinking: My early experiments in story game showed me that almost anything could happen in a game if the player took the time to lay the ground work for success. So jumping on top of a building in a single bound was very unlikely to happen. Walking up a flight of stairs was very likely to happen, going to the elevator was easy to do, and these action made making it to the roof inevitable. If you missed a roll, no sweat, try another approach to building the next step. Persistence rather than brilliance creates success. <br/><br/>Applied to life I could look at where I was and think about what I wanted. I wasn't there, so what could I do to lay the foundation to get there? I knew the games I was working on were very new and that that meant they would not be easily accepted or understood. I also knew that if I was willing to do the foot work, that they would succeed. So the needed virtue was not brilliance or awesomeness but was rather persistence and patience. All you had to do was look at the possibilities in front of you and pick the ones that lead to the long term goal. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So for me probability thinking focused me on the short term and really limited me. I'm not saying it would do this to everyone, it didn't even do it to me because I did do my experiment meeting beautiful women. It didn't even stop me making other games because if it had I would not have done what I did. What it did do though was suggest that success must come in one big move or not at all, which isn't the way the world works. Possibility thinking was useful because it predicts success if you put the work in and focuses thought onto what you need to do next. It also says up front to have an end goal in mind and not to be swayed from it by short term gain. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>What I'd like to hear in this thread are how the mental shift story games create has played out in your lives. I hope that possibility thinking is part of it but if focusing on the odds has been helpful for you I want to hear that as well. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432112/#Comment_432112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T06:34:58+00:00" title="May  5, 2014  6:34AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2014 6:58AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Focusing on the odds is tremendously helpful to me.  I analyze situations and fine-tune my models of reality as I go, often by creating quantitative scales for qualitative things, and building a sort of utilitarian matrix with them.  Two important points must be made about this.<br/><br/>First, it would be childish and superstitious to believe that a single-order calculation is going to be very useful as a reality-predicting tool.  X percent chance of ME marrying the most beautiful woman on campus?  That can only be determined after the fact.  But the chance of this step leading to that step leading to that step...  or the chance that <i>this</i> type of person is swayed by <i>that</i> type of language, getting me to <i>that</i> desired step...  that sort of stuff <i>can</i> be fuzzy-calculated within heuristic parameters and adjusted as you go.  We're talking about complex multidimensional webs of very simple calculations, not happening at once but drawn out upon each other, each containing its own probabilities and potential vectors, which enables/forces you to take a stance similar to "cognitive dissonance" or "Schrodinger's Cat".  When playing the odds, you remain in an uncollapsed wave-field.  You must remember that these are models, and continually adjust them.  The slippery slope lies not in <i>creating</i> models, but in believing them to be literal representations of reality, rather than the useful fictions they truly are, designed to help us jump fuzzily from one point to the next.<br/><br/>Second: Isn't this Possibility vs Probability division you're drawing rather like the division between what we call "left brain" and "right brain" thinking, but applied to predictive judgments?  And if so, then obviously the answer is that we need to use <i>both</i> in balance and allow each to feed back into the other.<br/><br/>Contract your left tailfin muscle.  Now contract your right tailfin muscle.  Repeat.  Again and again.  Faster.  Are you going left/right?  No, you are swimming <i>forward.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432118/#Comment_432118" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T08:35:35+00:00" title="May  5, 2014  8:35AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2014 9:34AM by Dreamer.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<del>For myself, I don't feel story games have shifted my thinking towards one or the other as Shock (the game I fell in love with), still uses dice to resolve conflicts and therefore it doesn't do away with probabilities.

You might find that actually possibilities are higher than you think, but reaching them requires quite a lot of lateral thinking, because the usual way is way too threaded to be of much use anyway. <br/><br/>When you finally see how everything is possible, it all becomes a matter of what do you actually want and how much effort do you want to put in it, considering that effort means time, money a toll on physical and mental health. Compare everything to the amount of happiness it will produce, but don't fool yourself: Happiness is a fleeting thing, and that beautiful woman will become old before you realize, and creating the next D&amp;D will become a nightmare to sustain in the long term (look at what they are doing now with Next), a work subject to so much critic from the audience and possibly misunderstood by way too many.<br/><br/>So, happiness isn't actually in dating and marrying that beutiful girl, not in making the next D&amp;D. Those are parts of life and nice simplifications to have for goals, but the actual goal I'd reccomend is to develope an attitude that helps you go trough life, have fun and share it with others. Because when you share your fun, nice girls appear from nowhere to have fun. All you need then is relax, be your best you (which is what every girl actually means when she asks you to be yourself) and share. And to make the next D&amp;D, all you need to do is relax, have fun, write down how you do it and share it with others, which is the same thing that D&amp;D creaters originally did and casually, up to the date, still remains being the least threaded path to get this kind of things done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432123/#Comment_432123" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T11:23:24+00:00" title="May  5, 2014 11:23AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is clearly an unclear topic. I know what I think it means. I'm interested to see what other people make of - especially people who read they other thread. <br/><br/>To help and clarify it a little. Seeing possibilities (to use my term) is the same skill as the ease with which one can frame scenes. When play falls down into rolling skills/stats/etc. action tends to fall only into those steps, like being in a well worn rut. When a game is about framing the next scene and playing it out (ala Fiasco) it can go off in different unexpected directions. <br/><br/>I've noticed that this kind of scene setting skill is real easy for me but seems hard (and for some people and impossible) task. Then once you've made that mental shift, how does that feed back into the rest of your life. Like me being married these last twenty-five years was partly due to me seeing the possibilities of Terri, which have been real good.

If you can't get what you want with the explicitly-defined mechanics, you look for another path to the same goal and try to get it by being wily. No big deal. (Honestly, the times I've seen a gaming group give up on a goal entirely when they didn't have what they needed for the obvious, prescribed route past an obstacle can be counted on one hand, with fingers to spare.

Being able to side step is the mark of a better game but seeing possibilities is more than that.<br/><br/>Let me give an example. I once ran a spy game at a con. One player ran the spy, the obvious story was to build a ring of agents and steal secrets. On player ran the police. He decided to play real dirty and violate civil rights left and right. An interesting approach but still well within what was expected. A third player had their character kill their lover at the beginning of the game and then spend the rest of the game destroying their character's psychi so that they confessed the crime at the end of the game. This was totally unexpected, fit the setting and was a kick ass story. She won the game.<br/><br/>The rules of the above example were not traditional. Instead each turn the player got to make up a whole scene, putting words into everyone's mouth. The game going in so many different did not wreck the game - it added to everyone's enjoyment. <br/><br/>If this gets back to sim vs nar, maybe that is part of what I'm getting at.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432575/#Comment_432575" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T19:40:48+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  7:40PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2014 7:41PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When I see a character sheet, with skills, stats, etc. I see probability thinking.

"DayTrippers", for instance, uses a system of Skills which are derived from Stats, thus you can try any roll even if you don't have that skill.  In fact, you can even try a roll for a skill that doesn't exist.  This is similar to some versions of "FUDGE" and other games do it too, but frankly I took my inspiration from "Roll For Shoes".<br/><br/>So, even while there seems to be a line there, it's also possible to build ways across it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432583/#Comment_432583" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T01:39:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  1:39AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2014 1:41AM by Paul88.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In your spy game I think you created the space for the unexpected to happen.

The unexpected is not just ways around a given challenge but of redefining what the challenges are. <br/><br/>Trad RPG rules unconsciously guide play by defining ways to do things. They prescribe a set of procedures and those defined paths are the ones we walk down. I like playing like this at times but it never opened my mind up in the way looking at all the possibilities did. <br/><br/>For example: Take The Lord of the Rings. Frodo is pitiful. He has no skills or anything that would predict success, no matter how much he steps around challenges. He ditches his competent friends and ends up with Sam (simple, loyal, Sam) and Gollum (curse your predictable but unexpected betrayal). Events build on events and Frodo's purity looks like it will win, but no! Gollum saves the day. You can't predict what will happen beforehand, which makes it fun to read. It could have gone in a lot of different directions. Evil could have won, it is not a straight line story like the Narnia books. Each moment is electric with many different possibilities. <br/><br/>In my life I make games. At first I wanted to make a hit and be famous (who doesn't) but I'm a pitiful Frodo. I do what I can to increase my abilities but in the end I'm unlikely to succeed based on them. There are a lot of people who are much better and smarter than I. But I see possibilities in front of me. I make decisions and make games. I see the feedback they inspire and learn from it. I watch what other people do and don't copy it (it doesn't tell my story - no one remembers who built the second airplane). I know I won't be famous or a wunderkind but I like what I've done. Looking at the electric possibilities in front of me and actively engaging them has made for an interesting life. <br/><br/>The games that helped me develop this world view put the players in the role of author rather than actor. Where you write whole scenes rather than get lost in the details. <br/><br/>I hope this isn't the sim vs nar debate. That was always so full of "My way is better than your's is." It made for great flame wars on RPG.net but was so pointless. I'm fully aware that this approach isn't for everyone. I'm just interested in seeing how many people have made this mental shift and how it's changed them. And for those who don't find it useful, what the juxtaposition of this kind of game next to a more trad game makes you think of. <br/><br/>I want to thank you all for resurrecting the thread. It looked like it died and I was going to respect the will of the crowd that it wasn't something people wanted to pursue. I'm interested to see what happens next. It is full of possibilities and I have no idea what will happen. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432598/#Comment_432598" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T07:27:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  7:27AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you are young you focus on possibilities.

I hope that possibility thinking is part of it but if focusing on the odds has been helpful for you I want to hear that as well. <br/><br/>Chris Engle</blockquote>\nI've gone back and forth on rather or not to reply to this thread. I've started at least three different replies, looking for a way to say what I was actually trying to. Hopefully this time.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I don't share any of the experiences or conclusions that you bring up. That doesn't mean either one of us is incorrect, only that we have had different experiences, or have opposing warrants or perceptions that have led us to differing outcomes and beliefs. So when I talk about these different takes on what you post, understand I'm not 'coming at you', merely offering a different take on the same themes.<br/><br/>Ok, so right away I have to say that story games created no mental shift for me. They were focused on different aspects of gaming, or used different techniques relating to those aspects, but for our roleplaying they were nothing truly new. Since our first games we were focused on rich characters and telling stories, and explored infinite possibilities. In fact, I could argue that much of the heavy mechanics encourages 'possibility thinking', but that might be better in the other thread.<br/><br/>Roleplaying in general definitely impacted my life, and perhaps encouraged certain shifts in thinking overall. I would also agree that two of these factors were probability analysis and creative problem solving (what I would equate to your 'possibility thinking').<br/><br/>If anything I'd say probability analysis is the more common, and more impacting aspect. Unlike what you describe, low odds doesn't necessarily mean not bothering for me. It's just acceptance of facts, and a way to analyze value. In roleplaying what action I take is dictated by my character, not the mechanics. If my barbarian would attack, then I attack. That I have only a 15% chance of winning isn't relevant. However, perhaps my military engineer character would alter how he attacks based on the odds, but ONLY because that's how that character actually behaves. <br/><br/>Conversely, high probability doesn't necessarily encourage me to do something. What I think I should do does. I'm fairly intelligent, and have an enormous amount of knowledge of and connection with law enforcement. As such I feel I have a high probability of success in criminal endeavors. However I don't generally participate in those things as I have other objections (morals, unintended consequences, value vs consequences, etc). <br/><br/>I'd also like to bring up the idea of 'pot odds' in poker. For those not familiar with it, basically this is looking at the payoff vs investment rather than merely the hand odds. If I need one of 10 cards to make my flush and win (I presume) I know I only have a 20% chance of success (from a full deck). However, if the pot is $100 and I only need to pay-in $10, then a 1:10 bet has a 2:10 chance of success - situationally making it a valid call. What's important about this is that you have to be able to calculate those odds to compare them to know rather it's worth calling. Possibility thinking MUST (statistically) cost you money at the table (unless you include expert reading and numerous other factors which aren't always controllable). <br/><br/>Certainly creative problem solving has had value as well. Especially in tactical situations (I've spent more than a decade in military and security work). Looking for hidden ways around, taking the time to plan, using one's environment, being aware of the behavior of others, etc. It's all valuable.<br/><br/>Roleplaying taught me a lot more than just those things however. Teamwork, social integration, friendship, numerous academic disciplines (history, sociology, economics, psychology, etc), creativity, time management, self-confidence, theatrics, public speaking, etc. It has been the single greatest impacting facet of my life in fact. However, nearly all of it came predominately from those early half dozen or dozen traditional games (D&amp;D, Shadowrun, etc). The only impact of this new independent gaming age (story games or otherwise) has been knowing I can focus on different aspects to different degrees, seeing some interesting unusual techniques to accomplish old tropes, and the possibility of self-publishing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432862/#Comment_432862" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T08:24:18+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  8:24AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Persistence rather than brilliance creates success. <br/><br/>Chris Engle</blockquote>\nI wanted to single that thought out since it's very close to something I've put great effort into disagreeing with in my life.<br/><br/>Both persistence and brilliance have a place. Both will reach an outcome, but usually it will be a DIFFERENT outcome.<br/><br/>In life, genius is a sudden advancement. Persistence is how we maintain in the interim, or adopt the new advancement. <br/><br/>The usual counter to this view ends up being the lightbulb...Edison trying 1000 times to make a lightbulb and finally getting it.

The persistence was finding a material that could implement the idea reliably and profitably. <br/><br/>We wouldn't be where we are without both types of people. We need geniuses to move us ahead, and we need persistent people to keep us all clothed and fed while we wait for the next genius.

I really appreciate the thoughtfulness. <br/><br/>I learned all those same lessons from D+D and the other trad games. Role playing is a great activity. A lot of those games became boring to me though because when run poorly they fall into ruts and become very predictable. Run well and they are things of beauty. That rut phenomenon is certainly part of my thinking on possibility thinking. It breaks you out of the ruts. <br/><br/>Genius and persistence: Boy! I get lots of ideas. They come at me all the time (save during tree pollen season and Ramadan). When I write them down that is the first step towards making them a real thing. What follows though is a LOT of work. Taking a game from idea to a marketable product is a six to twelve month process and can take years. Genius starts it but unless you are blessed with a great business partner most of your time is spent in the trenches. I may be jaded in this view. I've been slugging away at this for over twenty-five years having to do both roles. I love idea time but real value has only come when I did the footwork.<br/><br/>One thing I've learned from this thread is that my perception is far away from the main stream. I could view this as a message to try and bring to the main stream through persistent development or just live with the difference. For now I'll do the later.

Sure, some people may be "naturally" more creative than others, but in practice it's very hard to see the difference: it's drowned out almost instantly by the amount of work put in. <br/><br/>This goes for both "ends" of the process: as Chris says here, the spark of an idea is just the beginning, and the real work is in making it into some kind of Thing. Having an idea on its own it worth little. So, the person who has persistence and works harder will ultimately produce more novel and interesting content.<br/><br/>However, persistence plays just as much of a role in generating the "sparks" in the first place. Imagine yourself sitting at home, going to work, dealing with family crises and emergencies, your life consumed by all that. How many game ideas will you come up with in one week? Probably none (or maybe one!). Now imagine that you set aside three hours every day during which you do nothing but search for inspiring content, roll dice on random tables, look at art, listen to podcasts, and write down every cool idea which comes into your head. How many interesting ideas do you think you will have by the end of that same week?<br/><br/>Now notice that in the first case we weren't even talking about "interesting": rather, the question was, "will you produce any ideas at all?" In the second scenario, however, it was very natural to specify "how many INTERESTING ideas will you have by the end"? The goal line has shifted dramatically, without you even noticing.<br/><br/>Every wildly creative professional I know has some kind of methodical, disciplined way of creating new ideas on a regular basis, even if it's simply locking themselves in a room every day and not allowing themselves to exit until they've written down at least one good one. Persistence, in other words.<br/><br/>Over years and decades, that's what makes the difference in someone's "creativity".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432898/#Comment_432898" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T14:50:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  2:50PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES!<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of what I mean by possibility thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432901/#Comment_432901" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T15:06:05+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  3:06PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2014 3:30PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still don't see how a fully functioning human brain can do one without the other.

It's great to have one's mind expanded by any type of thinking but on my view, <i>breadth</i> of mind is attained by extending <i>both</i> of these capabilities, not just one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432914/#Comment_432914" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T07:09:05+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  7:09AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair point.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432918/#Comment_432918" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T08:48:19+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  8:48AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I still don't see how a fully functioning human brain can do one without the other.

One of the things I strongly dislike with <b>D&amp;D4</b> is when you level up, all the monsters level up too, which means that there is only an <i>illusion of change</i>. You never get better in numbers while the numbers increase. My friend pointed out that I had solved this differently in <b>Matin\xe9</b> where the oppositions' stats never are increased, but instead the number of opponents. So what is two hard opponents at the beginning of a career would then turn into five hard opponents later on, but with the same challenge as when we started playing with that character. The only difference is that the player now  feels more kick-ass as the character can plow through hordes of monsters.<br/><br/>It may seem like both these ways of handling opposition are about probability, but I think the whole terminology is wrong. It's about probability on the vertical scale contra probability on the horizontal scale. The later can be named "possibility" but that term will only show half the truth. Extra Credit talks about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVL4st0blGU" rel="nofollow">complexity vs depth</a> and has, by using those terms, turned the scale around. Vertical probability is what they call possiblity/depth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433048/#Comment_433048" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T06:39:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  6:39AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard is that just the possibilitys with a crunch ?

Using the stairs vs jumping vs using the elevator.  In <b>D&amp;D4</b>, you gain more (although finite) powers as you level up and will be given more choices in combat. You also gain higher attributes and bonuses that should increase the probability (lets say it does, for now).<br/><br/>Now, with my example, I increased the number of possibilities in the fight by adding more opponents. I didn't say however if the choice was worthless or not. If all the opponents are equal then it will be a worthless choice. If each opponent got a different power, then the possibilities would increase. But at the same time that this increases the possibilities, it also increases the probabilities. You're totally right that this can be all those three things\u2014crunch, authority and judgement\u2014but I wonder if it's relevant right now.<br/><br/>I don't really know if my example is any different if we instead talk about fiction. If you want to get away by trying to connect with some tattooed brutes or by running away and dropping money on the way, it's still probability where you calculate the outcomes\u2014even with no die rolls. Can we stand being beaten and possibly killed if something goes wrong, and is the gold really that much worth giving that outcome?<br/><br/>I also don't know if it's a good thing to <i>always</i> have a number of possibilities, now when I looked at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM" rel="nofollow">this video</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433076/#Comment_433076" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T14:06:10+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  2:06PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never read <a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer%27s">@MatrixGamer's</a> possibilities examples as nothing more than using other abilities,,, I kinda missed this " If you missed a roll, no sweat, try another approach to building the next step.

Emergence is the result from when several parts in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System" rel="nofollow">system</a> interact. I will continue using possibility and probability but keep in mind what I mean with it.<br/><br/>Imagine a locked door and you want to get through. Imagine the door being in a wall. Now you increased to possibilities to enforce the obstacle but you also present two different probabilities. Add a guard patrolling outside the wall with a key to the door. That's a third choice but offers a lot of probabilities. But look what happens if you now try to climb over the wall\u2014you will risk getting seen by the guard. This is synergy, when one thing is connected to another.<br/><br/>Probabilities just stack, where a wall with a guard creates two obstacles that decreases the chance to move on. Probability never creates synergy like possibilities can. The more things that live in synergy together, the more obscure the final outcome will be, which is what emergent complexity is about. Create how each part in the system affects other parts and you will have a living organism that will react when being tampered with. Tamper with the wall and the guard will react.<br/><br/>Compare this to, for example, bonuses and powers in <b>D&amp;D4</b>.<br/><br/>[edit] Oh, and with possibilities you can play around with <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/01/loss-aversion-achievements-and-trial-conversions/" rel="nofollow">loss aversion</a> too, where you fight to keep all of your possibilities intact. In <b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b>, you play vampires driven by the Beast\u2014the vampire's inner monster. During play, you can activate the Beast to use your vampiric abilities but people can also throw Beast commands at you to do bad stuff. You can reject a Beast command but then you will acquire a token, which can be used by others to make your Beast deny you of using the vampire abilities when you really need them. All in all, it's a strong loss aversion mechanic that also has synergy built into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433172/#Comment_433172" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T08:58:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2014  8:58AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2014 9:03AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Check the DMG, page 56.

That means you can keep the same difficulty of encounters for 7 levels (the range on threats and quests is even larger than for encounters), That's 56-70 encounters, or around 18-20 long sessions. If you meet every week that's 5 months of play.

Like, virtually everything everyone says about "possibility" is really just probability.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433180/#Comment_433180" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T11:41:11+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 11:41AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2014 11:43AM by Paul88.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey JD if your up on probability stuff could you help me get to grips with some basics ?<br/><br/>Can probability be used to create new stuff?<br/>It seems to be used in a reversed direction. e.g you know all the outcomes so you can create the probabilities)<br/><br/>Now when were talking about possibilities its the creating stuff, we haven't yet converted them to Probabilities.<br/> <br/>So is that the difference between Probability and possibility? <br/><br/>Is this a valid question or do you know with your experience *Koff* what I'm trying to say?<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433181/#Comment_433181" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T12:04:14+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 12:04PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2014 12:28PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not JD, but I have 2 answers.  <br/><br/>1. Over in the shortcut thread I just mentioned the "50-50 binary tree" approach to creative decision-making.  There's no reason you have to already know where that sequence of rolls is going to take you.  "Is it a monster?" (yes)  "One big thing or many small things?" (many small things)  "Is it in the book?" (no)  "Is it humanoid?" (yes)  "Does it have ...uh, a weird head?" (yes)  "Reptilian head?" (no)  "Bird head?" (yes)  "Does it have magic?" (yes)  "Combat magic or Divination?" (combat).  You'll notice what I'm doing here is <i>oscillating</i> (there's that word again) between proposing possibilities and making probability rolls, but because the probability remains the same every time, it's pretty clear that I'm paying more attention to the possibilities than the probabilities.<br/><br/>2. It's easy to imagine 2 tables which represent rational bell curves for two distinctly different classes of things - say social adjectives and animal types - and use two rolls to force yourself into imagining the intersection of those two things.  Now, there IS probability involved (because Table 1 says "observant" is more likely than "raging" and Table 2 says "dog" is more likely than "earthworm"), but when I roll and get "raging" and "earthworm" - well, nobody ever thought about a raging earthworm before.  My probabilities have forced me to consider a new possibility.  And on we go.  Lots of games do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433182/#Comment_433182" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T12:06:47+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 12:06PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand the question(s), they seem  bizarre.<br/><br/>First, you don't have to know "all the outcomes" in order to "create probabilities". For example, if you flip a fair coin fairly you have around a 50% outcome of head or tails even though the coin could land on its edge or a bomb could go off in your building collapsing the roof on top of you. Those other, unpredictable, unknowable outcomes are negligible - for our purposes in (say) playing the Prince Valiant RPG, flipping a coin has a 50% probability of being heads.<br/><br/>Second, you don't "convert" things to probabilities (or even "create probabilities" for that matter).  Instead, you analyze a situation mathematically to try to determine the probability of particular outcomes.  You are not creating probabilities or "converting" anything into probability. Nothing is converted or created when we look at a coin flip and determine there are two equally likely outcomes worth talking about - the coin is still the coin, the flip is still the flip.<br/><br/>Nobody has ever created a probability or "converted" anything to a probability in the history of all mankind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433183/#Comment_433183" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T12:11:31+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 12:11PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You'll notice what I'm doing here is <i>oscillating</i> (there's that word again) between proposing possibilities and making probability rolls, but because the probability remains the same every time, it's pretty clear that I'm paying more attention to the possibilities than the probabilities.</blockquote>\nHuh? Because you always have a 50-50 chance of each outcome, the possibility is more important than the probability? What if you rolled a die and 1/6 times you picked option A and 5/6 you picked option B? The probability is vitally important to each step of that process. The fact that it's 50-50 is crucial to determining if this system produces felicitous outcomes for you.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433184/#Comment_433184" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T12:23:04+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 12:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2014 12:25PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, JD, but in example 1 I'm just trying to underline the fact that the notion of "probability" can be used without any onus of "precision" or any charges about it being somehow "opposed" to possibility.

(That's game theory, another cool branch of mathematics, by the way, and also not "possibility".)

The probability that all of the oxygen in my home will quantum-tunnel into the refrigerator and I will suffocate is very low. It is not technically impossible...however, it IS not probable in a common, vernacular sense. That doesn't mean that there isn't a probability to express how unlikely it is, it just means that the probability is very, very, very, very low.<br/><br/>Probability is a way to mathematically express the likelihood of something, and anything that's possible must therefore have a probability (even if we don't or can't know what that probability might be, as in the case of your "if you roll a 4, man just do whatever you feel, nobody's gonna stop you" table). So I kinda see where he's coming from -- all possibilities must be able to be expressed as probabilities, even if that probability is so vanishingly small that it might as well be zero as far as you and I and any other ordinary non-mathematician is concerned.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433208/#Comment_433208" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T00:09:11+00:00" title="May 30, 2014 12:09AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2014 12:12AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Check the DMG, page 56.

That means you can keep the same difficulty of encounters for 7 levels (the range on threats and quests is even larger than for encounters), That's 56-70 encounters, or around 18-20 long sessions.

A 7 level range of encounter difficulty (from -2 to +4 levels) is actually wider than the range of encounter difficulty in prior editions of D&amp;D in many wandering monster tables.  A GM MAY increase the difficulty of encounters in ironclad lockstep, but the instructions of the game do not tell them to do that (any more than they tell them to keep all encounters at level 5 for the first 7 levels of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433216/#Comment_433216" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T07:32:22+00:00" title="May 30, 2014  7:32AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2014 7:33AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The example chart is the same.

We can establish probabilities for a wide range of actions and reactions around us, even if some are fairly vague.<br/><br/>We can also establish or at least estimate the probability of an average human taking certain actions, and generalize that to groups. (For instance, you can't usually meaningfully estimate the probability that your gaming group will stay together this year, but you might be able to estimate pretty well the probability that, of all the gaming groups in Berlin, half stay together.)<br/><br/>However, it's very difficult (and sometimes impossible) to apply probabilities to a single individual's decisions.

So please pardon my not joining in as much. <br/><br/>Please continue.</blockquote>\nHere's my take on probability vs. possibility thinking. I don't know if it's the same thing or a different thing from what you're getting at.<br/><br/>When I first started playing RPGs as a wee lad I would see great scenes in movies or read them in books and want to see them in my games, so I would convert them into RPG scenes in my head. So many of the best scenes are so highly unlikely. Siggurd kills a dragon with one blow. Bard shoots Smaug with the black arrow. The Karate Kid catches a fly with chopsticks!<br/><br/>Let's say the protagonist walks a tightrope from one building to the next, picks the lock on a window, sneaks in without being heard, takes out the guard walking down the hallway from behind, shoots a dart into a wall and swings across the courtyard on the cable that's attached to it, sneaks to the vault, dispatching another guard...what's the probability of success in this mad scheme? Awful. This is a terrible plan. It can go so wrong in so many places. You have to be an expert acrobat, climber, assassin, shooter, lock picker.  If I'm an expert in all those skills, say my character started in the 20% range and now has 75% in all of them. That's a 25% of falling off the tightrope, or a 25% chance of being stuck outside the window, or the guard seeing you, or missing your shot, or falling during the swing...One wrong dice roll, and it all goes horribly wrong. So, you don't do that. You do something safer, like just attack people with swords.<br/><br/>And that's really how I thought RPGs worked. How they had to work. They modeled probabilities. If something was nearly impossible in real life, then it should be nearly impossible in the game.<br/><br/>But, if you're playing Fiasco, what's the probability of that plan succeeding? 100%! If I'm narrating, all of that just happens. It may turn out to be the worst thing ever, but it happens. If I'm playing Fate? Pretty darn good. I may have to succeed with a cost along the way, but hey, that's cool. Or Burning Wheel? Well, it's different. The GM can say "Yeah, you walk the tightrope fine and the lock's no problem, the guards on the upper floor aren't going to be a problem...But, roll stealth plus a die for your climbing against their notice, and let's see if their waiting for you inside the vault..."<br/><br/>And suddenly, games can be all kinds of things. They don't have to model how bad your odds are any more. I like books where protagonists do improbable things, why wouldn't I want that in my games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433234/#Comment_433234" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T23:38:36+00:00" title="May 30, 2014 11:38PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And suddenly, <b>games can be all kinds of things.

Subjectivity, not objective truths.<br/><br/>You mention karate kid catching the fly. However, he first failed his 'continue life in nj' roll, then his 'integrate socially' roll, lost several fights (some badly), failed a 'ride bike' check, and so on. Yeah, he rolled a 20 on the 'fly catch maneuver', but it had no meaningful impact...it was just a humor moment in a string of failures while he trained up a few levels. To me it's a perfect example of the nature of random success rolls...you get em when you don't need em, and can't make an important one to save your life until you maximize your skills somewhat (or spend limited resources to assure success). <br/><br/>Conversely, find me a show where the protagonist can always, or even just usually, succeed in what he does (even if only the probable repeatedly). Do that, and I'll show you a show I have little interest in watching long term. It's why 'The A-Team' isn't still a tv show, and why 'Game of Thrones' is so popular now - sometimes it's the FAILURES, not the SUCCESSES, that build tension and make for an interesting &amp; realistic story. I think some games (Mouse Guard comes to mind) do wonderfully at highlighting this aspect of storytelling with 'twists'. <br/><br/>Of course, I can still enjoy the occasional cartoon or Hollywood action-trope where reality is less important than good meaningless sex, violence, or humor. It can be just as entertaining as the immersion shows. As you say, 'games can be all kinds of things'. I love to see the new directions people are going, but I don't think they invalidate what the earlier attempts focused on or created for us. <br/><br/>I also don't agree with the concept that a game can only 'serve one master' adequately. Yes, one focused on pure sim will be better at that one aspect than one which trades-off between sim and narrative, but if the game someone wants has both then the pure sim game will fail, while the other might succeed admirably.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433236/#Comment_433236" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-31T00:33:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2014 12:33AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2014 12:37AM by noclue.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>sometimes it's the FAILURES, not the SUCCESSES, that build tension and make for an interesting &amp; realistic story.</blockquote>\nSure, tons of failures.

In that game, rather than rolling for success or failure, you roll for <i>Overtone</i> ("Jovial" or "Glum") and you narrate the story in keeping with that tone.  There is a GM and she makes some important decisions, but the players make up as much of the adventure as she does by asking and answering questions, and they collaboratively decide on the story's Themes and Morals along the way.

The rules don't focus attention on maximizing the numbers but instead ask "What happens next?" A miriade of possibilities start coming to mind. Some lead in very different directions. Because there are many people playing there in some kind of negotiation on what happens. Then the question is what happens because of that?<br/><br/>The way this kind of negotiation happens is largely unsaid. It would be worthily of its own thread. Just as AW describes the conversation between GM and players, in largely GMless (or GM full - depending on how you look at it) there is a conversation between players. These unwritten rules might be very unfair. For instance, the prettiest, most popular, loudest, most socially skilled player may have more sway. While quiet, shy, uncertain, less popular, somehow socially invisible, player my get little say at all. As my wife and I grow older we've been noticing ourselves becoming more invisible. This would be a rich area to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433288/#Comment_433288" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T11:33:42+00:00" title="June  2, 2014 11:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aslf thanks for the link   <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/127968/Worlds-Without-Master-Issues-13-BUNDLE" rel="nofollow">"Swords Without Master"</a><br/>Have purchased and reading looks very interesting, perfect really thanks again.<br/><br/>How did you get on with this type of play? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433290/#Comment_433290" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T12:24:24+00:00" title="June  2, 2014 12:24PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2014 3:23PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in conflict about how to answer that, mainly because to do so completely would require a whole new thread and provoke many more contentious utterances than this one has.

Not much.<br/><br/>To elicit meaningful stories out of such games a certain type of player is required, and this type must be represented by a strong majority or totality of the group.  I also question the use of the word "game" here; in my mind, it doesn't apply without stretching it.  My conflict would dissolve instantly if such pieces didn't call themselves "games".
