I'd like to get your feedback on this.<br/><br/>(By soft I mean, if a thread starts to veer towards it, we remind people and guide it away from such discussion, rather than instalocking/banhammering) <br/><br/>Here's a quick summary of my thoughts:<br/><br/>1) These threads have continuously lead to bad blood. Slowing down the threads has softened them a bit, but insta-slowdowning threads isn't a solution I particularly like.<br/>2) It's not even a bad actor thing: it seems like everybody is doing a good job of making everybody else upset in a variety of ways.<br/>3) These terms are loaded to start with: they come from a pejorative usage in The Forge (as in don't run this type of game), not everybody has the same definition, etc.<br/>4) You folks have tried just about every technique possible to discuss it. I don't know what's left except for more circling the drains.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Feel free to whisper me, that's just as good as posting here.<br/><br/>I am particularly interested in hearing from lurkers or people who don't post in these threads. Is there a secret population of people who like these threads and find them useful?<br/><br/>Oh, in case it wasn't obvious, state your feelings/thoughts, don't argue/respond to each other, treat each other's opinions with respect: I'm interested in people's feedback, not in resolving out an answer through discourse.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436990/#Comment_436990" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T05:57:49+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:57AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get what you're saying, but I would much rather have unacceptable behaviors than unacceptable topics.  I think most of the people here can discuss contentious topics with sufficient detachment to be fruitful and only occasionally do things get problematic.<br/><br/>I sometimes read those threads and usually don't participate because it isn't my jam.  That doesn't mean I have nothing to learn.<br/><br/>In the job I had prior to my current one, the company attempted to avoid all personnel management issues by issuing global policies designed to combat unacceptable behaviors engaged in by a single person.  The policies were writ broadly so as to be difficult to circumvent.  This "management of the lowest common denominator" brought the whole place down when they could have just manned up and managed people as they were supposed to.  I know that this isn't your job and you're not being paid, so there are stark differences, but it seems like a reasonable analogy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436991/#Comment_436991" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T06:10:21+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  6:10AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve written and deleted several posts in this thread now.

These conversations belong here.  The vitrol doesn't, sure, and if there's a high vitrol-to-calm ratio in those topics then maybe keeping them out of the main loop is a worthy idea (after controlling for high-vitrol individuals, of course).

It's hard to not to take something personally when your activity is described with loaded terms. <br/><br/>I think it would be better to replace the term 'deception' for example, with something more bening sounding like 'artifice','guile', 'artfulness', 'craft'.

To avoid the appearance of engaging in cross-talk I'll just restate a few of them and move on to my contribution to the thread.<br/><br/>Despite how confusing GNS speak is at times, some of the terms are perfectly named. What better way to describe the illusion of choice than Illusionism? It is a much less loaded term than railroading, which seems to largely get a pass, despite them being--as far as I can tell--two similar terms that describe the exact same phenomena. But as mentioned, if absolutely necessary to avoid the permanent fracturing of the user base, ban the terms, not the topics. However, to discuss RPGs in any more depth than "I like it" you need to be able to discuss these topics. Note that the feelings will not change. The same poster who instantly reacts poorly to the term "Illusionism" will react just as badly to the term "Railroading" as they will react just as negatively when the new term "Shozbot" replaces the previous two. And that's the rub, it's clearly an issue with disruptive posters rather than disruptive topics. The topics themselves can't cause problems, only the posters can. If topic bans <i>must</i> be implemented, ban the disruptive posters from those topics, not the entire board. Just because a few people can't handle themselves well doesn't mean no one should be able to have a given conversation.<br/><br/>To go on a slight tangent that does relate to the topic (I promise) I want to mention a few of my own attempts at discussing more story structure related topics on this board (ie bringing some of the form along with some tips &amp; tricks writers use to create stories into gaming). Some posters engage honestly, with an apparent effort to understand and a willingness to possibly expand their thoughts on the topic despite any miscommunication or missteps on my part in broaching the topics. Others spill a lot of digital ink willfully disrupting and derailing the thread through feigned concern and blatantly misunderstanding whatever's said despite their clear ability to comprehend far more complex topics on other threads. Some people simply cannot stomach topics they don't like being discussed yet also lack the constitution and self-control to avoid thread-crapping an otherwise healthy conversation. Some know the letter of the law, and the mods, so well--or have simply been here so long--that they can saunter right up to the line and piss across the threshold without so much as a sideways glance from those in charge. I bring this up and think it relates to the question of mod policy in general because I still think of myself as an outsider here. This has been my experience on the board thus far. <br/><br/>The easy and least constructive way to handle this would be to simply ban the topics as that will be the least disruptive method of moderation. Sweep it under the rug as it were. But that won't change the underlying dynamic of the forum. Some posters simply don't like other posters. Some posters simply don't want to see certain topics discussed. Poster X doesn't like Poster Y who doesn't like Poster Z. So when Poster X brings up a topic Poster Y doesn't like, look out, there will be fireworks. A forum-wide topic ban won't change that. It won't make anything better, not long-term at least. You will stop <i>this</i> fight between those posters, but there will be others. Guaranteed. Having a sit down (or PM exchange) with the posters in question might make things better, or it might drive those posters off. When I was being blatantly concern trolled I was told I was the disruptive one (because I made the mistake of calling the poster out on it). From what I can tell, the other poster was given a pass and a huge dollop of presumption of innocence largely due to that other poster simply being here a really long time.<br/><br/>My honest advice, get a few new moderators who are also new to the forum, give them a clear, unbiased edict to bounce posters from topics, and to not let posters use the letter of the forum policy--or their status as long-time posters--to defeat the spirit of the forum policy. We are a group of humans who can, do, and will disagree. Rather than pretending we don't (banning contentious topics), stop the posters who cannot stop themselves from being disruptive (topic bans for certain posters, and sanctions for those who break the rules, no matter how slyly they do it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437059/#Comment_437059" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T10:28:26+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 10:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 10:28AM by James_Stuart.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so <a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, while in the future, if you have a problem with a moderation decision, I'd appreciate feedback or discussion rather than just calling people out publicly, since you didn't respond to my private message and are doing this publicly,  I'd just like to clear up some misconceptions.<br/><br/>I've only been active on here since May 2013, which is a lot younger than your account. In the thread you're referring to, I am more than acquaintances with/know personally *none* of these people. I don't think I've ever been accused of being reverential towards The Forge/old Story Gamers, but in case you were wondering and the first post on the page doesn't help you, definitively not.<br/><br/>I appear in your mind to have made the wrong decision in responding to that thread: I'm figuring this stuff out like anybody, and I fully invite you to message me and take me up on this, and we can have a longer conversation, and I'm happy to take your feedback on this. Part of what pushed me to make this thread is that while singling out bad actors for punishment is easy, a lot of these threads escalate off of small micro-aggressions, and people steadily raising the tone and heat to each other.<br/><br/>But the idea that somehow this is a cabal of old mods and the people they love: that does not feel accurate to me at all. <br/><br/>Please feel free to continue this with me in whisper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437061/#Comment_437061" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T10:48:17+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 10:48AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if there is a trigger issue at the root of this.

I've seen this in other communities outside of RPGs. The best I think we can do is work, slowly, to some understanding.

I did not relate this in any way to the "not the Forge" post. I'm not seeing any blockage of discourse, just an honest request for advice and help on how to deal with this new issue.<br/><br/>So, yeah: those discussions are becoming prevalent, often unproductive, and occasionally toxic. Like many posters, I am very interested in the topic and would <i>love</i> some healthy discussion. A couple points:<br/><br/>1. "Ban posters, not topics" could potentially cause hurt feelings when someone feels like they're banned for their opinions.<br/>2. Perma-banning any topic is dumb and clearly not being suggested<br/>3. In keeping with the "slow down" rule precedent, a <i>short term</i> moratorium on this heated issue may let people reflect on their position, presentation, and commentary.

Some portion of this board has had negative experiences with styles of play that are well-represented by the term "Illusionism", such that they would prefer not to participate in such play, or consider it to be fundamentally flawed or dysfunctional.<br/>3. The term "Illusionism", as culturally understood by a large portion of this board, implies a lack of consent by definition. I consider this definition to be problematic: in a wider culture that is striving to encourage consent, any activity which is <i>by definition</i> nonconsensual must necessarily be unethical. This leads to everybody in group 1 feeling as if the culture on this board is declaring their play to be unethical by definition, which leads to upset and general outrage.<br/><br/>So, the terms Illusionism/Participationism, as currently understood, are firebrands of discontent and should probably be re-examined. At the same time, I assume the moderators do not wish the Story Games board to be the venue where RPG theory is codified (see "Story Games [is not] The Forge"). So, where should that discussion occur, and what should we do here in the meantime?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437070/#Comment_437070" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T12:23:35+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 12:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wonder if there is a trigger issue at the root of this.

The GM has a story in mind that they are running the players through. Those are the rails. This story is happening, despite what the PCs do and the players may want. Railroading. Some players want to feel like they have control despite them having no control whatsoever. The illusion of choice. The act of running a game that is on the rails, ie railroading the story, while also providing the players with the illusion of choice. Illusionism.<br/><br/>There's only deception <i>if</i> the GM isn't upfront about what they're doing. If the GM declares you're running through a module that evening, chances are there's a fairly solid rail on that game. If the GM declares you're a group starting off in a town and starts play with, "What do you do?", chances are there's few, if any, rails involved. If the GM presents the game session as having real, meaningful choices but relentlessly takes the session back to the rails, that is deception, pure and simple. If the GM doesn't want to be accused of deception, then they should be explicit about what they're doing and be upfront with their players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437079/#Comment_437079" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T13:02:55+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  1:02PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 1:40PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What shall I answer.<br/><br/>The Scylla is that liblarva believes that I am defending Illusionism\u2081.<br/>The Charybdis is that contracycle believes that I am attacking Illusionism\u2082.<br/><br/>I am squashed paper thin.<br/>Can\u2019t they fight amongst each other where I can be safe.<br/><small>ETA: or better yet, of course, find peace</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437080/#Comment_437080" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T13:19:38+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  1:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What shall I answer.<br/><br/>The Scylla is that liblarva believes that I am defending Illusionism\u2081.<br/>The Charybdis is that contracycle believes that I am attacking Illusionism\u2082.<br/><br/>I am squashed paper thin.<br/>Can\u2019t they fight amongst each other where I can be safe.</blockquote>\nHuh. I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying. But apparently you're misreading that as me trying to fight with you. My post to you above was simply to point out that there is no One True Social Contract as your post initially seemed to imply, and that you eventually understood me to mean.<br/><br/>I don't see that there really are two uses of Illusionism. Only two perceptions of the same thing. Some people like it; some people hate it.

Always. But then again, I'm an anti-post-modernist at war with political correctness, so my preferences don't jibe with those of many others. <br/><br/>Since I truly believe that offense is the problem of the one being offended, and vehemently against censorship in all forms, I guess I'd prefer to see something like a DMZ sub-forum for sensitive topics where people can put whatever is causing offense. That way it can be discussed, and potential gains had from it, while putting the burden on the individual to look away if they aren't ok with what they're seeing. Obviously there could still be some fundamental lines not to cross (criminal threats for instance). <br/><br/>I'm STRONGLY opposed to focus on the language. We empower words, not vice versa. Once we start banning words cultures merely borrow other words to fill in, which eventually become corrupted and banned and sooner or later there are no words left (all while failing to address the underlying topics). <br/><br/>Even things like slowdowns really won't solve anything, though in some few instances I can see it allowing for a breath to be taken which might lead to rephrasing something. More often it seems the topics are locked anyway. It's like mom whispering cancer at the dinner table...saying it softly (or not at all) isn't going to keep grandpa alive one day longer. Openly discussing it, and coming to understand it, actually can (even if there's crying, screaming, and grandma feinting while little becky sue runs off to her room because of it).<br/><br/>Just my $.02.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437092/#Comment_437092" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T14:38:31+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  2:38PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 2:38PM by James_Stuart.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback so far.

There are some topics on which some people have pointed opinions, and they/we are proving to have difficulties interacting around those topics in a civil way. This is in no way different from the kinds of problems any host of a cultural salon faces any time they host something of the sort: people are this way. The only difference is that the Internet medium makes it easier for people to spiral into social stand-offs.<br/><br/>I dislike banning topics and limiting discourse in this kind of situation, just like I would dislike it at a face to face salon. I much prefer genuine engagement and learning to get along as a means of improvement: the specific people who have problems need to learn to disengage and keep their peace, and perhaps over time they will improve and find accord with their foemen. Stopping this process because it seems bumpy is giving up and ensures that no resolution is ever reached; the sore remains open, and a new one is broached every time a moderator stops a discussion instead of facilitating it.<br/><br/>I also favour seeking fault over avoiding conflict; with some patience we discover where problems lie, and can then take even radical steps about it. The most extreme move should be disinviting a person who doesn't play well with others (or who others don't play well with, whichever), if it seems that no progress is made and they continuously provoke breaches of peace. This is an extreme solution, though, and I think it should only be reserved for people who do not respond to social initiatives and do not try to work on their side to improve understanding and amity. The idea that individual people <i>might</i> have to leave the salon if they cannot make it work is important as a possibility, even if the option is almost never exercised in practice.<br/><br/>In summation: I think that insofar as moderator involvement is needed in these kinds of heated topics, it is to take the most difficult people (and yes, this needs to be a totally social, competent evaluation - the host has to know who's the one causing problems) aside and talk with them to improve their conduct. If they are willing to do better, then problem solved. If they prove unresponsive, they can be asked to leave. That's how you run a courteous salon.<br/><br/>And yes, the standards of a "courteous salon" are in some ways socially unfair at times. For example, it might mean ousting a person who is right, but does not have the social skills to express their disagreements in a courteous manner. Nevertheless, I think that a forum like Story Games needs to be run in a courteous manner over other considerations, because without that essential amity and security of friendship the essential functions of the forum cannot be fulfilled. I of course fully expect to be the person asked to leave one of these days myself <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding the specific case of illusionism discussion, here's what it looks like to me, point by point:<br/><b>*</b> There is a strong shared ethos among many people on this forum regarding illusionism: we've done it, it hasn't worked for us, we've moved on. This basically causes a sort of group-think phenomenon, where many people agree with each other. It's one of those ideological cornerstone details that make up the profile of "what kinds of roleplaying are favoured by the SG forums".<br/><b>*</b> There's like two or three people who combine an enjoyment of illusionism with an enjoyment of controversy, and they provoke heated arguments on this subject. Gareth and Jason, to be explicit - there might be others, but these two have stuck to my mind. One way to look at the situation is that these two, by unfailingly contesting the general ethos, are causing arguments.<br/><b>*</b> While ordinarily disagreeing on something doesn't need to descend into incivility here, the particular narrative involved in this case has proven wonderfully efficient in encouraging mindless flame-war. Specifically, this idea that people are being persecuted and slandered for their illusionistic preferences, it has proven to be quite the excellent accelerant for frayed patiences. It is a meme that does not want to die, no matter the amount of back-pedaling, analytic parsing of statements and apologizing, for nursing such injuries is what martyrs are made of.<br/><br/>As can be seen, to me the social dynamics here seem relatively clear: a few pro-illusionism posters are aggravating otherwise reasonably civil discussions, and to me it seems that they're not particularly trying to seek accord - they're seeking a soapbox, rather. I'm the same way about some topics, it really takes a conscious choice for me to stay away from some topic on which I strongly disagree with the majority opinion. This mode of discourse - political soapboxing - then encourages arguing instead of amity, and we've seen the results. This behavior pattern only makes sense for someone who feels surrounded by ignorance and apathy; in that situation it is good enough for you to get the truth out, even if all it amounts to is sniping at other participants of a discussion.<br/><br/>I should emphasize that the above explanation of my perception does not imply anything about who's right or who's wrong on the substantial question; it's just my observation about who and what and why seems to be causing tempers to fray and the quality of discourse to plummet. The problem isn't that illusionism is wrong, it's that people are engaging in inflexible, hostility-inducing modes of discourse.<br/><br/>The clear climax of the recent bickering was when Gareth attacked Sandra over the weekend for misusing difficult theoretical terminology in a way he felt was slanderous. I'm sure Gareth himself doesn't feel too good about that in hindsight, either, but it's an emblematic example of the run-away social dynamics at play here. I think it's good to note explicitly that Sandra did nothing wrong in that situation, Gareth just felt so strongly on the topic that he jumped to some pretty far-fetched conclusions right away.<br/><br/>The situation isn't even very serious as these things go (we've all seen much worse in the Internet); were I a moderator, I would consider asking a few of the participants to show more courtesy and consideration in their future interactions, but I don't really think that much more than that is needed. I mean, I certainly have an opinion regarding the substantial issue, but I don't feel particularly angry or hostile towards Gareth or Jason or other pro-illusionism debaters here; they're fine people, even if a bit thorny at times. They've clearly expressed their displeasure at people not acknowledging that illusionist play <i>can</i> be consensual as well, and I for one will attempt to be more clear on that in the future; not that I ever disagreed, but it is apparently easy to communicate a different impression.<br/><br/>As for the future of discussing illusionism, I would suggest for everybody to come to the topic with increased self-awareness, and a willingness to not take offense. The fact that somebody else doesn't like the kind of roleplaying you do is <i>not</i> a massive social affront that has to be confronted with hostility. You can just record your disagreement and then perhaps compare experiences, and that's that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437096/#Comment_437096" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T14:59:57+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  2:59PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How would people feel about the following idea: temporarily, a certain class of threads getting immediate SLOWDOWNS (one post per 24 hours), not as a punishment, but just as part and parcel (this would start with all participationism/illusionism threads, plus probably all theory).

I'm ashamed that it was a thread of mine the one that started all this. I'm sad that everyone misunderstood it as an attack to illusionism and later misunderstood that I (or everyone, for what matters) was defending some kind of sick, manipulative, wicked, non-functional, forced sort of gameplay. No one is actually doing such thing. Think it twice, that person that you think is defending a "lie" or calling you a "liar" (and many other things), simply has a different view on the subject and a different experience with that specific gameplay style, that against all you may have experience, makes it a functional and enjoyable experience. If you can't believe it, you're still missing something. If you asked and that person couldn't give you a reasonable answer, believe me, it's because the thing that makes that gameplay work is a concept so ellusive that defies explanation, but it's there.<br/><br/>Anyway, you don't have to believe me on that. All I can show you as proof of that is a feeling on my guts. Anyway, more mixed emotions: I'm glad we're finally talking about this. While we have a bazillion different games, there's an awfully big amount of people that think all the rules have been written. This argument shows that there's a lot of unspoken rules that haven been written yet and are crucial for creating one game experience or another, and the game won't work (or will work by sheer luck, as it happens today) if players and GM just wander in unaware of the boundaries of a healthy social contract.<br/><br/>On top of that, I'm kinda amazed, kinda bit mad that this heat has gone higher and further than that thread you closed a few week ago, James, that about gender where I posted that link that you misunderstood as simple standing comedy, and was actually an opinion I agree with, shown with humor. I mean, I didn't even think that was pollitically incorrect (nor it was my intent to come off that way) and while I agree that that particular discussion had potential to be volatile and you were right on closing that thread, at that moment I felt frustrated that right when the thread was getting somewhere (most of the misunderstandings and flames were over at that moment) it was shut down. I felt like things didn't have a closure, and a bit sad that your final comment there left me as some sort of archetipical (insert here your prefered word for intolerant macho mysoginist that can't take seriously people of other gender or sexual orientation).<br/><br/>But it's okey, I mean, I ended up taking no offense, understood the thread was over and despite the paragraph above, have no hard feelings nor I question your authority nor your understanding on the subject. I'm sure it had something to do with the way I express my opinions and the fact that I belong to a different culture (I'm peruvian and english is my second language). The reason I brought it up is that probably some threads should have been stopped or even closed earlier. I say this even when I'm actually learning a lot from the serious discussion admist the flames. I see there that we are taking some actual steps forward. And yet if it's for the health of the whole storygames community, I'd ask you to put a stop to it. I'm for closing the most toxic threads and slowdown the rest.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437099/#Comment_437099" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T15:28:53+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 3:51PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since the earliest days of dial-up bulletin boards, through the USENET era, and e'en unto now, online arguments arc towards nastiness and hurt feelings. And the speed in which they move towards that is inversely proportional to how important the topic is.<br/><br/><br/>Probably the best thing that could happen would be for people to police themselves. Maybe a simple checklist, like:<br/><br/>1. Have I been posting on this topic or related ones for longer than a month?<br/><br/>2. Have I had a strong opinion about this for longer than a couple of weeks?<br/><br/>3. Have I participated in more than two threads about this during my entire life without my opinion about it changing significantly?<br/><br/>4. Does it genuinely bother me when other people I don't play games with and may never actually meet in person disagree with my opinion?<br/><br/>5. Does it genuinely ruin my own gaming experiences to know that other people might be doing things I wouldn't enjoy, even theoretically?<br/><br/>6. Do I feel a strong need for my opinion to be critiqued, corrected, or merely validated by a lot of people?<br/><br/>And if the answer to any of those is "YES," you just don't post. You can continue to discuss it privately within your own hand-picked circle of friends, but leave the public threads for the people who still find the whole topic to be shiny and new. If you like, you can keep reading those threads just to see what opinions the starry-eyed newbies form on their own -- maybe they'll surprise you with an insight that never occurred to you, maybe (probably) they won't, but at least they'll get the fun of developing their own ideas without all of us old-timers burying them underneath re-enactments of old battles and demanding that they stay within the lines we drew years ago. Or you could skip reading the public threads entirely, because really, what do you care? We all have literally no stakes whatsoever in any of this, after all.<br/><br/>And if at any point you find yourself feeling some kind of emotion about your Important Gaming Opinion, you definitely don't post (and maybe even stop reading entirely) until that feeling passes. Because I think we all can admit outside the heat of the moment that getting angry about games is pretty dumb, and getting angry about theories about games is even dumber.<br/><br/>It won't happen, of course, online arguments being what they are (especially since it's hard to let people be wrong on the internet, and even harder to not correct their wrongness when it's something you've jumped in to correct before!).

I'd rather that what those people didn't bring the illusionism topic into other discussions because they didn't have a space to say what they wanted to say about illusionism because of thread locks or slowdowns.

What's the goal here? To stop people from getting overheated about the topic or to stop the topic from popping up repeatedly? Topic banning across the forum doesn't stop people from getting overheated about other topics, and they will. Slowdowns don't stop people from getting overheated, only less frequently. Only actually giving posters warnings and days off will prevent the negative behavior.<br/><br/>Also, the idea that an active conversation should have to wait for people to continue is a fundamentally silly one. If some people aren't at their computers when a flurry of ideas happen to strike some posters, that's no reason to stop those ideas from being put up on the forum. "Sorry, Bob. I can't talk to you about this right now because Janet isn't in the room."<br/><br/>Here's another thought. Lock all the older threads on the topic. Sticky the most recent, or make a new one. And let people just hash it out in one place. When things get heated, give people a day or two off from the forum. If they keep at it, topic ban that poster. If they're so incensed they cannot control themselves and continue to post on it, permaban them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437122/#Comment_437122" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T18:00:42+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  6:00PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am unconvinced that too many threads about one topic on the front page is a real problem. It's never bothered me when e.g. Dungeon World or some other game I don't play becomes a hot topic of discussion temporarily; it doesn't take much effort to skip those threads if you want.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the ability to shape discussion with thread semantics remains our one most powerful tool in actually keeping this place civilized. The ability to start new threads to restage a question, reshuffle the participants, set localized engagement guidelines, and break on-going social one-upmanship in an old thread is key in the way we've managed order historically. (In light of my salon simile, this is sort of similar to having the discussion participants break off and go into separate rooms to chill out.) The single reason for why I personally accept locking threads <i>at all</i> is the presumed right to restage the discussion in a new thread - without this capability that particular moderation habit would be tyrannical bullying that achieves nothing except silencing people. With thread spinning the people who feel that they have been unjustly interpreted or silenced in earlier threads can always start a new discussion on the same topic, hopefully with better luck. Meanwhile those who got bored on the topic don't feel a social commitment to engaging when the topic moves to a new thread.<br/><br/>For those who've followed this Illusionism discussion now, you can see how we have been making use of this technique: all those new threads are not started idly, they're attempts by each participant to discover a new angle of attack that might achieve amity and avoid the murk that creeps into prior threads. If all those discussions were in a single thread, nobody could make heads or tails of it for the sheer speed and scope of social engagement.<br/><br/>For these reasons I would rather not develop the idea of shuffling compassionate topics into their own reservations. We've seen what those frankenstein discussions are like on forums that make heavy use of them: nobody can read the entire thread due to its length, discussion rambles, and the practical outcome is that only extremely committed old-timers care to contribute to the topic. Reneval and new ideas depend on welcoming new initiatives rather than shutting them down with "there's a 3,000 post thread on top of the forum for this topic, please post your observations there".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437124/#Comment_437124" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T18:11:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  6:11PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that Slowdown is as effective as Sinking in killing a thread.

It's a lot more of: "these two people don't bounce off of each other well, and they aggravate each other in a slow ascent." That makes the oft-suggested "take out problematic posters" kind of difficult to do.<br/><br/>This is kind of doubled down by the trends I'm seeing here in these discussions (and private messages). There's been a few attempts to identify the parties who are responsible, there's been more than one "I got talked to by a mod, and I think it's pretty unfair that I did", and there's little "Yeah, hey, I'm not the only one who can get worked up, but I need to do a better job on this."<br/><br/>What I'm definitely not hearing is "yeah, we as a community can get a little feisty, so you know, if you step in, we'll give you the benefit of the doubt and settle it down."<br/><br/>From what I've heard from Andy, and almost all of the interactions I've had, people in most cases respond very poorly to moderation. That's almost somewhat understandable: I only personally know a few of you, and having random people on the internet tell you you're doing it wrong probably isn't that pleasant.<br/><br/>So I have this uneasy suspicion that when people support stronger person-based mod intervention, they're assuming it's going to fall on those other, bad people.<br/><br/>Let me know how I'm wrong here.<br/><br/>(ps: this isn't a veiled attack on you, for any and all values of you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437132/#Comment_437132" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T19:55:12+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  7:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well James it is "your place" after all, but I appreciate your reticence to come on with nothing more than that as a justification.<br/><br/>I'm for self-labeled threads which receive stronger backup from moderation staff.

But banning topics won't solve that problem. So you implement the "we don't say illusionism here" policy, somebody doesn't read the sticky and creates a thread with illusionism in the title, somebody else moderates the poster, and *boom* the odds are they're going to feel ill-used.  Moderating is a mug's game at best, but you're setting yourself up for failure with such a move, because ultimately it's arbitrary. "What? I can't talk about this aspect of gaming here? That's crazy!" Moderating may not make you any friends, but moderating isn't about being people's friend. It's about establishing yourself as the authority within a particular discursive space for how we do things around here, and that implies to me that a moderator's bailiwick is the communication behaviors displayed by participants in moderated discussion. The only topic moderation that should occur is when you say, "This is off-topic for this site."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437136/#Comment_437136" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T20:33:32+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  8:33PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poor response to moderation is understandable to me, really; a moderator is poisoned as a social standard by the task and the authority. I obey moderator dicta as a matter of decency, but I don't respect such orders; a true person would engage rather than command.<br/><br/>This sort of sentiment doesn't make moderator action easy, of course. I would recommend acting only sparsely and relying on community self-policing for the most part. Encouraging everybody to do their part, and only using moderation in extreme situations where social relations have broken down, seems like the ideal to me. Even then, use of explicit moderation powers like locks and bans in lieu of resolving social problems seems undesirable.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think that James is right in his feeling that active moderation probably doesn't get much in the way of social encouragement from the mob. Authority-derived moderation might not be the ideal way to organize adult people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John" title="Virginian_John"><img alt="Virginian_John" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nK0KBJPN6LXY5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">Virginian_John</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437137/#Comment_437137" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T20:52:34+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  8:52PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have opinions on topics over at Yahoo news and other places. I give my opinion but a lot of times I end my post with some relevant Christian bible quotes. Most people do not like the quotes at the end and they are not shy to tell me. I get told off, I get cursed at, I get my religion made fun of.  I very rarely respond back but it is always with tact and respect, I never post back out of anger or curse back. I know I will be trashed but I post my opinions and thoughts anyway.<br/><br/>Too many people speak before their brains process these days. A lot of people are quick to anger and criticize. Not many people take a moment to give consideration to thought and feelings for their fellow human.<br/><br/>My point is, the people going into these threads that are causing conflict to read or post know what they are doing. Let them. They have the choice not to open that thread again if it gets too heated. If they come looking for help from a moderator, tough luck (unless it breaks a forum rule).<br/><br/>"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."

One specific bad behavior I've seen a lot, and that relates to a whole ton of broader social justice concerns, is <i>denying other people's experiences</i>. As an example, many people, myself included, have often felt like they were deceived into gaming situations where they didn't have any real choice. So, it can be hard when AsIf cites that sort of thing as simply GMs being artless and then goes on to start a whole thread about how to do the same thing only with more "artistry." Whatever the intent was, it <i>feels</i> like a denial that there was a "real" problem at the heart of what we experienced. On the "other side," many people who feel like they've used Illusionist techniques to good effect when GMing feel as though posters whose experiences/feelings about Illusionism (or Railroading, or whatever) are universally negative are denying *their* experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John" title="Virginian_John"><img alt="Virginian_John" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nK0KBJPN6LXY5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">Virginian_John</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437157/#Comment_437157" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T07:05:06+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  7:05AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>  Yes it is and you are welcome.

That's more of a reflection not for lack of interest in such topics, however: Most of what I know about RPG theory comes from fascinating threads on this very site that encouraged me to read materials elsewhere, so I'd be sad to see entire shades of that forbidden.<br/><br/>I also agree with the opinion that "just deal with the problem people" is more problematic and less practical to implement than it sounds for reasons already discussed.<br/><br/>I am not sure what a reasonable alternative would be, but I actually rather like the idea of <i>voluntarily</i> starting threads with a one-post-per-day limit, regardless of topic. (This is what I was originally planning on suggesting before I even got to that suggestion in the thread.) I have started (and certainly read) forum threads that would've really benefitted from that, and I could see opting to do it in the future. This is decidedly different from instituting an across-the-board policy of only a single post per day for at least two major reasons. First, some threads would not benefit from slowing down conversation in this way, and instead thrive on quick replies and bouncing ideas around (e.g., many requests for input under "Make Stuff"). And second, I think there's a big difference between a figure in a position of authority exercising <i>control</i> and the person who started a conversation <i>opting</i> to encourage a certain kind of conversation. The second approach is something we do regularly already, like when we write in the first paragraph of a post things like, "I'd appreciate if we could avoid discussion of X and instead focus on Y." I wouldn't mind having a mechanism to formalize that a bit more. This approach would also make sure new visitors wouldn't get called out for accidentally breaking arbitrary forum rules. Instead, it'd be on them to get to know <i>community standards,</i> which (most) people naturally try to do when entering a new social space.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437170/#Comment_437170" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T11:01:22+00:00" title="August 13, 2014 11:01AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks all for your feedback!

I've been reading these forums for give or take a year and a half, but hadn't felt the need/had the expertise/had a new point of view to input my opinion until recently. (The dynamics in mixed vs. single gender groups thread WarriorMonk mentioned, which actually was closed right before I was approved, heh. Though I do understand that thread was getting rather heated.) So, this is just my perspective as someone who gains insight from reading, rather than being an active participant, and I think actually my first post.<br/><br/>I'd fear that the banning of topics on Illusionism would lead to less or restricted discussion of the games which I've found I enjoy most: games in which illusionism/predestination is written in by the game's creator. Things like The Journey (which is one of my top experiences), Montsegur 1244, 90 Minutes, and some Jeepform I've played, which have resulted in the most rewarding gaming I've had in the past 10+ years of playing D&amp;D, MUDs/MOOs, and forum-style RPGs. And while I understand that this topic is one that draws a lot of high passions from folks, I'd not know where to turn if a ban on discussion of this topic were to chill the discussion of games in which illusionism is a tactic for telling a particular story or for generating a certain emotional atmosphere from the participants. And perhaps some of this is related to what may be my own incomplete understanding of the term or rather it's loaded implications - but it seems those definitions and implications, as others have mentioned, may be the problem rather than the base issue itself.<br/><br/>But if Story-Games is not the place for talk about those games - as a noob who vastly prefers forums to social media sites - how do I find what is that place (that isn't in Norwegian)? Additionally, as someone new to thinking about the theory of RPGs, while The Forge may seem incomprehensible due to jargon and an insider's only attitude, a large part of what I enjoy about this place is reading well thought out and differing opinions of RPG theory and meta discussions presented in clear language. (A suggestion for a "please do" posting behavior: if one is using a jargony term or abbreviation for the first time in a thread, to either explain in parenthesis or via link.)<br/><br/>And so, as someone who is both fairly new and quite enjoys what seem to be termed illusionist games, I'd hate for the topic to be banned entirely. But I do understand that these threads that get out of hand can be a problem, and that moderating forums can be a rough job. If you're considering a time based limitation, and the Vanilla system allows it, a 12-hour slowdown may work better than a 24-hour. Both would allow for significant cool down time, but 12 hours allows for people to read and get caught up and post, without being annoyed or feeling punished because there's 12 minuets left on their last response which puts them just beyond their lunch break, or whatever. Additionally, (and again I don't know if this is something available in Vanilla, or as a plugin, or would be easily writeable) perhaps tempbanning aggressive actors from a particular thread, either permanently or for a certain number of hours to let tempers cool, may be effective in reducing the flaming going on but still allow for reasoned discussion on a topic in which sensitive, potentially divisive, and perhaps elucidating thoughts are being proposed.<br/><br/>I'm sure I've rambled on long enough here, but as for one last thing, even though responses are verboten. I do agree with Eero_Tuovinen's remarks about social salons - if one can imagine this forum as a place to cultivate an intellectually respectful friendship with others, and remember that we're all part of a fairly small community and all in this together in creating, running, playing in, talking about, and promoting that story-focused gaming we like, I think it's all the more likely that we'll be able to have sensitive discussions which allow for genuine differences of opinion and technique without intentionally trying to raise eachother's hackles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437211/#Comment_437211" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T23:51:41+00:00" title="August 13, 2014 11:51PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think it's good to note explicitly that Sandra did nothing wrong in that situation, Gareth just felt so strongly on the topic that he jumped to some pretty far-fetched conclusions right away.</blockquote>\nLet\u2019s remember that before Gareth adressed me I had been arguing with Tod (whom I had cleared things up in whispers with \u2014 I had misunderstood him).

To not be able to discuss it here, whether from bad poster behavior or from moderator meddling, would be a huge loss.<br/><br/>"Moderate bad behavior only" sounds right to me.  If two people are not quite being dicks but <i>are</i> destroying a thread's ability to continue productively, then that's bad behavior, and a moderator can call them on it if they so choose.<br/><br/>It seems to me that illusionism discussions waste a lot of time and frustration on re-covering old ground and making sure certain points have been heard.  To combat that, here's an idea:<br/><br/>1) I'll write a primer on the history of illusionism, describing how it's been awesome, and how it's been terrible, and how it's been everything in between.  I'll also summarize the history of the discussion about it.<br/><br/>2) Whenever anyone begins a thread about illusionism, the opening post should link to the primer and advise people to read it before commenting.  If the thread-starter forgets, James can edit their post to include this.<br/><br/>This may enable people to say "read the primer" or "read Part 3 of the primer" instead of launching into many paragraphs of debate in response to a comment that sounds ignorant of some facet of illusionism that's deemed important.  This in turn will cut down on the level of frustration and make it easier for everyone to be nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437225/#Comment_437225" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T04:55:11+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  4:55AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm down with the idea of moderating bad behavior, and not just because I'm callous enough to not care all that much if it hurts the feelings of the people who are behaving badly. I understand not be able to rein yourself in when you get too worked up about a topic -- we've all been there -- but <i>someone</i> should tap you on the shoulder when that happens and tell you to calm down and stop making things worse, and that's what moderators are for.<br/><br/><br/>But really, if linking to an explanatory essay could prevent bad behavior and misunderstandings, the internet would be a very different place. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Better to start every thread on a topic like illusionism with a big warning label that says, "If you've ever participated in a discussion about this subject before, maybe you should just sit this one out.

"Assuming that one's opposition is going to ruin everything, and acting on that" might be the biggest discussion problem the topic faces.<br/><br/>I nominated myself as primer author for exactly the reasons I described.  I've seen all sides.  I've seen and done good illusionism and bad illusionism.  I have no concept of it as purely good or evil.  It's a tool I'd like to keep in my toolkit for those situations where it'd be fun.  Gareth makes sense to me, and Sandra makes sense to me too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437350/#Comment_437350" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T10:06:00+00:00" title="August 15, 2014 10:06AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2014 11:04AM by Graham.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I think you should ban discussions for a defined period of time.<br/><br/>That does seem like a positive thing: it'll give everyone a chance to think, regroup and move on with new thoughts.<br/><br/>(The idea of a primer, which people get pointed to, is very Forge-like.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19676/mod-policy-feedback-requested-participationism-illusionism" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19676/mod-policy-feedback-requested-participationism-illusionism" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19676/mod-policy-feedback-requested-participationism-illusionism/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19676%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19676%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
