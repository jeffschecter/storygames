I've also been starting to play Legend of the Five Rings (L5R) 4th edition. A recent thread on teaching etiquette in L5R got me thinking, why should we bother with etiquette L5R? I knew it added to the experience, but that's kind of vague. Then it hit me.<br/><br/>Etiquette in L5R functions like the ritual phrases in Polaris. They mark the move towards conflict, when someone is looking for a reaction from a PC, and even the end of many scene changes. Etiquette can work this way because its understanding is shared by the players (at least, it can if they put a fraction of the effort into learning the etiquette as they do into learning the rules). It can work this way because it is not merely an action to be taken, but a ritualization of something greater. What appears to be a bunch of minor details is an important part of storytelling. Once etiquette is established through practice, even the violation of etiquette creates a sense of disruption within the flow of the story, and so that becomes a method of storytelling too. Etiquette does more than that, as do key phrases. They both reinforce the spirit of the game. Being heavily improvised, it seems easy to mess up in Polaris and reduce the game to a joke, but the game's beautiful keyphrases can mark a return to the poetic tragedy the game is about. So can it be with etiquette and L5R's mood.<br/><br/>Does anybody else see this? Are there other games with similar patterns (Nobilis, perhaps)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
