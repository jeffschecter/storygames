The game text has it that Dissuade is used to pretty much do the same things you'd use Persuade for, except in a negative way. The ol' Diplomacy/Intimidate distinction, familiar from D&amp;D. I didn't find it interesting there, either, of course. Probably the best way to make Dissuade carry its weight is to emphasize the idea that all social interactions are either positive or negative, and positive is not the default. Makes for a somewhat grim world, but some horror is like that - the random guy from the gass station chews your head off for looking at him the wrong way, things like that.<br/><br/>The important point, though, is that the particular abilities are really not that important to the overall structure of the game - they can overlap, and you can basically just use the ones that you feel useful. No need to ever use Dissuade if a situation doesn't come up for it, or you can just bend the situation and color it to make Dissuade work if that's the character concept. And you can always run specialties off it if nothing else. The survival point rules allow you to get pretty flexible with what you roll, anyway. The game won't even break if you just throw the pair out or put in something else in their stead. Persuade/Willpower comes to mind as an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185556/#Comment_185556" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T01:35:48+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  1:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinkin' about using Befriend/Berate or Befriend/Bully.<br/>What do ya think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185559/#Comment_185559" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T02:21:03+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  2:21AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sure, but how is that different from the original?

I understand the desire to pair like-sounding words together, but in this case, it's shit.<br/><br/>For me, the clearest word to put in there instead is "Coerce", but YMMV.<br/><br/>The weirdest thing about the pairing is that, unlike the other pairs, these two are not opposite goals accomplished via the same action (see: Pursue/Escape) but the reverse: same basic goal for either one, accomplished via entirely different actions.  The designer tried to make them seem like opposing goals by naming them in a confusing manner, but that's chaff. <br/><br/>From the point of view of the fiction, what's important in this case isn't whether or not you convince the target* to do what you want, but <i>how you go about doing it</i> -- what kind of emotional fingerprint your character leaves on the scene and the game as a whole.<br/><br/>* - Graham's excellent point that this pair can be used on people, creatures and inanimate objects leads me to a whole host of interesting new specializations for this pair.<br/><br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The question of how the pairings work in conjunction with each other is interesting, because each pair is an 'opposite' in a different way.<br/><br/>Attack/Defend:  Opposite goals using (in most cases) entirely different skills (defending from being shot at uses completely different physical skills than actually shooting, for example).<br/><br/>Persuade/Whateveryoucallit: Same goals, opposing methods.<br/><br/>Pursue/Escape and Identify/Obscure: opposing goals, using largely identical skill sets (the exception being...

Persuade is attempting to get someone to do a specific thing; Dissuade is attempting to get them to <i>not</i> do a specific thing.<br/><br/>A point that was made in my old behavioral psychology class was that while a punishment can tell someone what not to do, it doesn't by itself tell them what <i>to</i> do.  The same applies with Dissuade.  <br/><br/>To put it another way, you can Persuade someone to help you; but you cannot use Dissuade to get them to help you.  You could use it to get them not to try to harm you, but that's a much more limited thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185586/#Comment_185586" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T10:51:29+00:00" title="January  1, 2009 10:51AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not the way the rules work, though - the descriptions of the abilities are pretty clear in allowing for wide leeway in interpreting them.

Help/Hinder kinda is too, although Hinder implies you're making something harder for someone rather than getting them to not to do something.<br/><br/>I'll also comment that in the many games I've run of DoN, I'm not sure anyone has ever rolled a dissuade check.
