My design goals are to make a no-prep game that can capture the tension, twists, and betrayals of these films in a single session of play (longer than a movie but not by too much).<br/><br/>My most recent playtest of <i>House of Cards</i> at Go Play Northwest started smoothly but exploded spectacularly in the middle as the gears of my mechanics and story structure seized up. So I\u2019m returning to first principles and re-evaluating everything. Hopefully that\u2019s where you come in.<br/><br/>I know I\u2019m not the only one who loves these films, so I ask you: What do you want to see in a game emulating heist and caper movies? <br/><br/>If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve played these stories using other systems. So what really worked well for you when doing a heist or caper in another game? Conversely, what totally didn\u2019t work or feel right with the system you used?<br/><br/>Extra Credit: What is your favorite heist or caper film that I must see to get this game right? I\u2019ve watched a bunch, but I\u2019m always looking to add to the filmography.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223134/#Comment_223134" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T23:27:52+00:00" title="August  6, 2009 11:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rififi and The Asphalt Jungle are two of the best heist movies I've seen.<br/><br/>I'm too tired to add anything coherent on your other questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223138/#Comment_223138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T00:07:32+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 12:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see a game that supports multiple-level whiplash cons, like Confidence or Lucky Number Slevin. I've been contemplating hacking Wilderness of Mirrors to make it happen. The idea that scenario creation is part of character creation in such an intimate way seems like it might be important.<br/><br/>As for gaming: we've used Fiasco, to great effect, to emulate the kind of heist flick where the protagonists don't come out so well. The coolest thing about Fiasco is how the characters emerge from situation creation (again), and are tied to the caper that will go down starting on the very first turn. There are no filler scenes at the beginning, in the "you meet at a tavern" mold. The second coolest thing about Fiasco is that the number of scenes is strictly limited and as that clock ticks down to zero, the players are forced to keep things moving along to their inevitable conclusions - no dilly-dallying, no equivocation, just narrative thrust. I feel like that really is in flavor for the genre and I recommend implementing a countdown in any action-y game. Hell, I'm beginning to think that every game might benefit from a Puppetland-style time control rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223139/#Comment_223139" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T00:16:37+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 12:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2009 12:21AM by DannyK.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!  We've needed a good heist RPG for ages now.  <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A few of the things that delight me in a good heist movie:</span><br/>--The eccentric cast of characters with specialized skills and issues<br/>--The backstory of why this particular place is worth robbing, and the way that the initial information is almost always misleading or incomplete<br/>--The hidden agendas that come out: this guy wants revenge on his fellow thief, that guy wants to blow up the place they're robbing, the other guy wants to double-cross everyone and keep it for himself<br/>--the crunchy detail of how the heist goes down -- the feeling of learning a clever way to do something you'll never do yourself, like safecracking or forced entry or surveillance.  <br/>--the place of contingency, the guard forgot his thermos of coffee so he comes back and interrupts the heist in progress and gets shot.  Sometimes they're like parables of randomness.  <br/>--I particularly like the non-linear heist movies, where there's sort of an hourglass shape to the story with a lot of attention paid to what happens before and after the heist, and the heist is sort of the narrow part of the story where everything comes together.  <br/>--I also like the drama between mistrustful crooks, paranoid about each other and about pursuit.  <br/>--Inevitably, something goes awry and the story flips, the focus shifts from following the plan to crazy improvisation, trying to survive the treacherous team member or whatever.  I think it's really important that a game like this can handle those shifts smoothly.<br/>--the reluctant heist, or One Last Job.  This is a big damn cliche, but it still works well in movies like Sexy Beast.  <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Play experiences: </span><br/>I played in an Unknown Armies game where the PC's were private detectives paid to pull a heist on a mysterious (presumably occult) millionaire's pad.  I liked the way every character had an obsession right on their character sheet, that drove the play really well because they served both as niche protection and as story drivers (my snoopy character, for example, would get everyone in trouble because he'd <i>watch too much</i>).  The occult aspect was subtle but very spooky, things like guard dogs with a hive mind.  It was one of those games where the characters really clicked with each other and everybody was headed for a bad end, but I don't know how much of that was driven by the system as opposed to table chemistry. <br/><br/>I'm playing in a WHFRP online game right now which is basically the aftermath of a heist gone bad, it's great fun but it got pretty participationist after a while.  The best part of the game was running like hell to stay ahead of the law and stay alive and get paid; it's flagged a bit since then.    One thought: heist stories  work better if they're kept focused, almost picaresque.  Maybe a setup where a favorite character could reappear on a different job, with no attention paid to what the thieves do in their downtime until they get back into prep mode for the next heist. One thing that works well for it is the gritty and unforgiving nature of the setting and the rules, both of which make death and disfigurement a constant possibility.  I also like the fact that the game uses task resolution, it really brings out that edgy feeling to roll well but still not get anywhere because you're looking in the wrong place.  <br/><br/>I'd been looking at running a heist game myself using Fate 3.0, but my guys opted for PTA instead.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Besides movies, I'd like to recommend a couple books:</span><br/>Any of the Parker novels by John Westlake.  Existentialist noir heist novels with a dead-eyed sociopath for a hero and a gloomy tone that makes the most unlikely plot twists seem utterly plausible.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2142091/" rel="nofollow">Here's an appreciation of the series.</a><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Void Moon</span>, by Michael Connelly.  A great psychological heist thriller about a young woman who <i>steals too much</i> from a Vegas casino patron.  This one has it all, psychopathic pursuers, tradecraft, betrayals, heartfelt motivations, crazy twists of fate. I saw Connelly read last month and asked him why there's no sequel and he said something very story-gameish: "That book is about the biggest choice the protagonist will ever make in her life.  I don't want to follow it with just a caper novel."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223152/#Comment_223152" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T06:59:32+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  6:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the moment when expectations are subverted, everything goes pear-shaped, and the team is forced to improvise using their honed skills, native grit, and pure luck.

I totally agree on integrating scenario and character creation. My beginning sequence, which worked pretty well during the GPNW playtest, recruits the crew members one at a time (aka creates the characters) in response to specific complications authored by the players that the team knows they will have to overcome to pull off the job. <br/><br/>I've been wondering how useful it would be to crib from WoM and have a grand planning scene after the crew is recruited. The genre often does incomplete, almost montage-like planning stuff in many movies to allow big reveals later, but having a blueprint for the heist would be a great help to then subverting it and inventing surprises on the fly.\n<blockquote>The second coolest thing about Fiasco is that the number of scenes is strictly limited and as that clock ticks down to zero, the players are forced to keep things moving along to their inevitable conclusions - no dilly-dallying, no equivocation, just narrative thrust.

Hell, I'm beginning to think that every game might benefit from a Puppetland-style time control rule.</blockquote>\nThat's a great observation about the genre. I've been thinking that a "scene economy" in the sense of Burning Empires that limits each character to a set number of each scene type might do the trick here to preserve narrative momentum while still having some quiet moments in certain scenes for character development, etc. A "timer" of some sort seems vital to keep things moving and get the game done in a single session.<br/><br/>Thanks for the helpful insights, Colin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223246/#Comment_223246" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T12:06:19+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 12:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>I want to see a game that will actually give credit to the planning phase of the heist, making that fun.

I also relish that feeling of waiting for the plan to come under stress in these films, whether by accident or the deliberate betrayal of the team. If I keep a GM role in place, I need to make sure they've got the opportunity and guidance to come up with appropriate twists to capture that. I'm resisting the siren call of oracles right now, but maybe they would assist in producing unexpected results at key points during the job.

I think that this is because, in story games, you are all still figuring out where the story will go, so including the salient hints and development and ignoring all the mundane logistics can be tricky.<br/><br/>I can think of two ways to handle this off the top of my head.<br/><br/>1) Flashbacks, flashbacks, flashbacks. Jump right into the action, and then as the destination becomes clear, flashbacks can illuminate the planning and development stage. Of course, they would actually be informing each other. I like this method a lot.<br/><br/>2) A mechanic that codifies earlier development, hints, and prep in a way that gives an advantage for or mandates reincorporation of those elements. If you go this way, then it should be designed in such a way that reincorporation is almost certain to occur. If the faceman buys a gun in act 1, then it damn well better have been used by act 2... so, no empty uncertainty in the planning narrative: everything that is planned is reincorporated somehow.<br/><br/>These two things could be built together somehow.<br/><br/>Cool, btw.

Did you feel that inter-character chemistry from the start, or did it only develop over time? Was there anything in particular the GM or players did to initiate and build upon that chemistry, despite the potential for obsessions that were at odds with each other? One of my concerns is trying to get meaningful interaction and investment in the team packed into a short play time.<br/><br/>I don't have personal experience with WHFRP, but gritty rules that take the time to focus on the tasks involved in a job sound appealing. I definitely want more granularity and back-and-forth exchanges in my mechanics than "state intent - draw cards/roll dice -  compare - narrate resolution."  <br/><br/>Thanks for the book recommendations, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223346/#Comment_223346" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T19:21:48+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  7:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul>\n<li>Tension</li>\n<li>Character development, so that I care who wins..</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223347/#Comment_223347" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T20:02:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  8:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth, that's another awesome list of inspirational elements. I definitely see these as hyper-competent characters--awesome but with flaws that could derail the job. Getting the betrayal balance just right - appealing for both fictional and mechanical reasons, but not necessary - is important to me, too. The spread of heist/caper films exhibit a broad spectrum from no betrayals to massive betrayals at every turn, and I'd like the game to be able to reflect that.<br/><br/>Julian, I've been working more with the second type of planning mechanics, but the first type is super hawt. Since I'm revamping anyway, I'm gonna work on that flashback idea. <br/><br/>Thanks for the insightful comments, everyone. This is really helpful stuff as I reorient on the next iteration of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223357/#Comment_223357" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T22:12:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 10:12PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite caper film:  <i>11 Harrowhouse</i><br/><br/>I've also thought of using <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i> to do a con / caper story.  I noticed watching <i>Leverage</i> a couple of weeks ago that the main cast is exactly the character types from Wilderness of Mirrors, just with different iconic names.  The second season opening credits make this point abundantly clear.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
