This will help people get a sneak preview of what's offered, and also to gauge interest (by the amount of people who reserve a seat).<br/><br/>But we are also doing pitch sessions, just like before, so most people will still be making the "what do I play" decision in that moment.<br/><br/>The kid's track has been expanded, and it looks like there may be a modest increase in the number of children from last year.<br/>[One dozen registered so far, ages 0-12]<br/><br/>One of the cabins has been set aside for LARP games, to serve as a dedicated space.<br/><br/>People will bring food and drinks local to them and swap.<br/><br/>Operation Blind Drop will do the same with people's under-used games, books, and such.  (But in a random silly kind of way)<br/><br/>New people are coming, old hands will be there, and we're all going to try to make everyone feel welcome, but we're going to spend most of our time gaming.  Game hard, clean the place up, and go back home. <a href="http://www.campnerdly.org/code.html" rel="nofollow">The Nerdly Code</a><br/><br/>Also, Sunday has two gaming slots this year, as we've got the Camp until late afternoon.  This is expected to be a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
