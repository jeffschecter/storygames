So let's talk about it.<br/><br/>(you can download and read the <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Principia.aspx" rel="nofollow">Principia beta rules</a> for yourself, if you want to skip my summary)<br/><br/>The basic idea is that throughout the action of the game, players introduce big (big!) philosophical themes. They're abstract yes/no questions, like "Do two wrongs make a right?" "Can a person rise above their birth?" "Can anyone ever love selflessly?" During conflicts you invoke the themes to get extra dice (to win fights, etc) and potentially take control of the question. Eventually (usually after a bunch of scenes, and only at the end of sessions) you dice off to see whether the answer is yes or no. Then one player narrates how that truth is reflected by the touchstone NPC who was chosen to represent that philosophical question in the first place.<br/><br/>So if the question was "Can a person rise above their birth?" players will find ways to bring that into play during scenes. When it gets resolved, if the dice say no, that's now the truth of this universe: you can't. If the touchstone was the Marco D'Espagna (an NPC), the bastard child of the Duke by a serving woman, a player gets to narrate how his attempts to be treated as a peer fall apart, etc.<br/><br/>Touchstone narration is a separate epilogue / narration system outside of normal play. Normally you're playing your character doing stuff, but when it's time to resolve War of Ideas questions you step into a gods-eye narrative author mode.<br/><br/>I think it's very cool, because you're injecting really big thoughts into play. When someone throws "Does God ever forgive?" on the table, it's going to cast everything that the characters do in a whole new light.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330888/#Comment_330888" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T17:20:42+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  5:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To make it very clear, I want to emphasize that you're not just voting for what you think is true in the real world ("of course a man can rise above his birth!") you're establishing the philosophical truths of the fictional world.

The questions are abstract yes/no questions, but each one is tied to a particular person, place, or thing in the fiction.<br/><br/>So, for example, the question gets posed "Do the ends justify the means" and the person it's tied to is Machiavelli.<br/><br/>During play, players invoke the question in order to add +1 to one side of a conflict. Multilple players might do this in one conflict, and multilpe questions might be invoked in the conflict. After the conflict, everyone who participated adds a vote to the "yes" or "no" side of one question. <br/><br/>At the end of play, all the questions are resolved based on the votes they've received. Whatever answer won out (or an ambiguous answer for a tie) becomes the truth in the fiction. For each question, the player(s) who influenced the result the most gets to narrate an epiloge for the person, place or thing named on it in a way that illustrates the answer.<br/><br/>So, for example, after we determine in our game that the end does NOT justify the means, one player gets to narrate Machiavelli's fate, like how he earns eternal life as a vampire but finds it a torment or something.<br/><br/>You can't re-pose a question, but you can come back at the issue from another angle later in play. <br/><br/>That's the essentials.<br/><br/>The kind of gameplay you get is strong, principled character fighting for (or compromising) their ideals, ultimately changing the world and themselves in big ways. Then we get to sit down and play again in that new world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332374/#Comment_332374" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T20:54:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are only three things you have to decide to graft the War of Ideas onto another game:<br/><br/>1) when can you introduce new questions<br/><br/>2) how do you invoke questions &amp; what do you get for invoking them (if anything)<br/><br/>3) when do you resolve questions<br/><br/>Number 2 is the biggest season-to-taste part. In some games you might get a boost in conflicts for bringing in questions, but in others you might only put your name on the question but do nothing to alter the flow of play at the time (if you're playing Archipelago, you're not getting another d6 to win a sword fight). Even if bringing in questions doesn't give you more mechanical power to win a conflict (or whatever) it should still be pretty attractive because you're gaining narrative control to resolve it.<br/><br/>PS "questions" needs better term to reflect that these are freakin pillars of philosophy, core truths, etc. "War of Ideas" describes the scale nicely, "questions" not so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332411/#Comment_332411" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T02:54:02+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  2:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool - thanks!<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332442/#Comment_332442" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T06:59:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just downloaded PRINCIPIA and read through it.

For example, you can ask that the touchstone (the person, place, or thing that's tied to the question) have a fictional or thematic connection to the question. Leave this up to the individual player's judgment. It's not an area where you want to make restrictions. However, in running Principia through its various permutations, I've found that you don't need such a rule. It happens naturally in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332579/#Comment_332579" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T18:05:40+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br/><br/>I mean when you're in conflict, and you want to bring in/invoke a Question, how do you do it?

In Principia, you just say "I'm invoking this question," and you turn the card that the question is written on sideways . You do this because only one person may invoke a particular question in each conflict. That way everyone can see what has already been invoked.<br/><br/>At various points, there has been a rule about how the question must be something that's involved in the current scene. This is a very minor, but significant point. It's up to the player invoking the question to decide if it's involved or not. If someone questions it, they should provide a justification. This can actually lead to some very interesting table discussion. Also, in Principia you can always pose a new question, so if you don't see one on the table that fits, you just pose a new one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332598/#Comment_332598" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T20:46:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  8:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tony!<br/><br/>That's exactly what I was wondering about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332603/#Comment_332603" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T21:18:21+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  9:18PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony wrote: "WOW!

I've been looking for a way to bring Mary Renault's novels to life as a game, but specifically a game that embraces the things an Athenian citizen would hold dear: citizenship, glory, family, power, politics.  The initial idea is called ATTIKA: players create Athenian citizens in the wake of the Persian Wars and progress via generational play through the Peloponnesian War.  I want something as rigorously historical as a game can be, with some measure of the history integrated into the rules so all (or most) players will be on equal footing.  I thought about incorporating bits and bobs from GDW's old En Garde!, but i'm not sure.  I don't consider myself much of a game designer, so I'm not sure where to begin . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the threadjack!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
