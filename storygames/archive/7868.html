This means that among the survivors, wood to make stakes are a valuable commodity. (Logical derivitive of the starter assumption). Wood barons pop up in certain shanty towns."<br/><br/>"Metaphorical logic" is based on using a starter assumption based on metaphor, possibly deriving new facts based that are extensions of the metaphor, but avoiding establishing new facts based on logical derivations from the metaphor.<br/><br/>Example of consistent Metaphorical logic: "The world is overrun with vampires! (Vampires are actually greedy people). Vampires hide themselves in order to prey on others. (Because greedy people often do so to trick others, unless they read too much Ayn Rand in college)."<br/><br/>Example of inconsistent Metaphorical logic: "The world is overrun with vampires! (Vampires are actually greedy people.) Vampire hide themselves in order to prey on others. (Because greedy people often do so to trick others), vampirism is caused by mitochondria (Uhhh... okay.) The mitochondria can be destroyed by special guns (Now its getting kinda silly...)"<br/><br/>The usefulness of this model comes into my personal reading of Shock: Notably, that is a game keenly designed to address fiction using Speculative logic, whether the source of the first assumption is possible-technology or not. The rules would seem fine applied to say, a Twilight Zonish game.(Its even an example in the back!). Conversley, buck rogers-alien sidekick-spaceships-explosions-green whores "sci-fi" is a type of game noted to not work with it.<br/><br/>Also, I think some of the subtler points of playing Sorcerer come from using the game with metaphorical logic, as opposed to speculative logic. When you try to treat the game with speculative logic, you get arguments about whether characters believe in demons and facts derived from the fact that little horned people are running around, which tends to be kind of bollocks. But if you keep with people in a dysfunctional relationship with little horned dudes, and don't get into how little horn dudes effect society at large, you have a good start.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174570/#Comment_174570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T09:05:45+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  9:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True. I like the idea of starting out with a metaphor and then turning it into a "real" world or alternative world.<br/><br/>But if you want to write a good allegory, or make a game about allegory, you will have to keep your metaphorical logic straight. You might even want to make a multi-tiered system, where you work out the event which is the basis of the metaphor before interpreting it into the allegorical game world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174967/#Comment_174967" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T14:44:52+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  2:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2008 2:45PM by Marshall Burns.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>Example of inconsistent Metaphorical logic: "The world is overrun with vampires!

You add new facts based on their sheer coolness factor.<br/><br/>This is funny, but it's also an important point.  This kind of "Awesome" Logic <i>does</i> exist and <i>is</i> widely used, even if it often results in complete silliness.  Someday I'll think of an example of where it didn't turn out to be silly.  Anybody got one?  Surely it's possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175078/#Comment_175078" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T10:53:29+00:00" title="October 15, 2008 10:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite><br/>and anything else based on the arcade fighting genre.<br/></blockquote>\nOh, right!
