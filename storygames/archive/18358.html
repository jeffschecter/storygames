Our first two sessions were missing a certain something, so I came here to <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18291/tsoy-memories-long-forgotten-resurface" rel="nofollow">get some advice</a>. Here's a recap.<br/><br/>We have three players: myself the SG, Pat and Geoff. We've all known each other for many years. Pat made a goblin who is addicted to destruction, which he typically causes with Three-Corner Destruction magic. Geoff is playing an elf Zaru who is collecting Zu words because he wants to understand the nature of magic. <br/><br/>The goblin had the keys of Destruction (XP for destroying things valued by others), Renown (XP for becoming famous), and Disrespect (XP for being discourteous). So he gets big rewards for blowing things up, then rubbing it in people's faces. That had concerned me, because the character's whole point is to cause trouble. It reminded me of an old discussion of <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=21555.0" rel="nofollow">how Keys could encourage griefing</a>. After reading everyone's (especially Eero's) advice on my recent thread, Pat and I had negotiated the rules regarding goblin addictions, so we were all on the same page. That made a big difference.<br/><br/>I also suddenly remembered Key Scenes (which I had totally not done in the previous sessions). Key Scenes engage me the SG. I want certain scenes to happen, so I encourage them by giving out XP. It also encourages the players to move toward the stuff I've prepped, rather than exploring absolutely anything. I created 3 Key Scenes: learn about the approaching army (1 XP), find the ruined village (3 XP), and Francis throws someone (5 XP to whoever gets thrown, 2 XP to everyone else in the scene). I made sure to write them out and show them to the players, so they knew what to go for. Rewards are better when they're explicit.<br/><br/>We also added a fourth player to the group: Dawn, who has never played TSOY but I used to play D&amp;D3E with her many years ago. We started off introducing the rules to her, and it went smoothly. I like TSOY in part because it superficially looks a lot like D&amp;D 3E but the differences completely change the gameplay (Keys, and the fact that even someone with 0 in an ability can beat someone with a 3, in theory). Showing her the rules and creating her character took about an hour, then we started playing.<br/><br/>The end of the previous session gave us a sort-of clean slate. The characters had just escaped their slaveowner and they were on the run, so we could put them into a fresh situation. We introduced Dawn's character, a greedy (Key of Glittering Gold) Ammeni thief who was helping the locals liberate slaves (Key of Conscience).<br/><br/>They found themselves in a forested valley meeting a horde of ratkin, when they all got attacked by the Maldorean army. (Let's kick things off with some action, yes?) Javelins incoming! Soldiers with axes! The elf building defensive walls with Zu! The goblin blowing up the army with Destruction magic and all his 7 Vigor points! Boom. Then they found out the ratkin knew magic, which got everyone's attention, and they met Francis the ratkin wizard.<br/><br/>Overall I was happy with the session. It flowed smoothly, there was a lot of action, and everyone was engaged. Here's my thoughts:<br/><br/>1) We clearly framed scenes, identifying when one scene ended and another began. That was really helpful, both for understanding the fiction and giving XP.<br/><br/>2) We never did a BDTP, and in fact we've only done one BDTP in our three sessions. That's not a bad thing but it does feel like we're ignoring a significant part of the system. Maybe I'm not providing high enough stakes. I'll try upping the ante next session and see what happens.<br/><br/>3) Pat suggested that having a woman at the table balanced us, made us more co-operative. I don't think that happened to me, but maybe he experienced it.<br/><br/>Good times!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413783/#Comment_413783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T14:48:37+00:00" title="May  8, 2013  2:48PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We introduced Dawn's character, a greedy (Key of Glittering Gold) Ammeni thief who was helping the locals liberate slaves (Key of Conscience). </blockquote>\nI like that character - simple and to the point, and fits the setting well. TSoY chargen works best, I find, when you've got a clear concept that you can explain by pointing at the character sheet like that.\n<blockquote><br/>2) We never did a BDTP, and in fact we've only done one BDTP in our three sessions.

The game plays fine without BDtP, and the problem in trying to force it is that it's intended for a specific sort of situation that might not come up for a while as a campaign is finding itself.<br/><br/>Specifically, the situations where BDtP is needed and justified are 1) complex, 2) ambivalent and 3) dramatically charged. In those situations the group can maintain focus on the same situation for a longer time-period. If you end up doing BDtP out of habit - for example, because all "big battles" need to be played out in detail according to 3rd ed D&amp;D experience - then you might find that it's boring and repetitive.<br/><br/>As a rule of thumb: if the rule about changing intent in BDtP seems unnecessary because obviously everybody in this conflict has clear goals and they're just going to roll the dice until somebody gives way, then that's probably a much too routine and simple situation for BDtP. Likewise, if there isn't any interesting "fight choreography" to be had in the form of varied moves and interaction with the background, then the situation is probably again too simple.<br/><br/>In practice, of course, the Story Guide doesn't get a say: the players decide whether they want to invoke BDtP, and when they do, the only choice the SG has is to have the NPCs involved give up. This is an entirely reasonable choice if you don't find a given BDtP entertaining: the player choice to demand it already signifies that the player cares about winning, so by all means give it to them if you don't.<br/><br/>The intended filtering behavior of the game as regards BDtP is straightforward: you play along, using the relatively random and merciless simple conflict mechanics, until an outcome comes up that a player is not happy with. Either they wanted to achieve more, or they did not want to lose, and they were willing to stake their character's well-being on it. It can take a while for a new campaign to get into a situation where a player feels this strongly about any given conflict. Just continue prodding at the characters to find out what they value, and sooner or later you'll prod at something they aren't willing to give up. When that happens, it's BDtP time.\n<blockquote>3) Pat suggested that having a woman at the table balanced us, made us more co-operative. I don't think that happened to me, but maybe he experienced it.</blockquote>\nMy experience is that a mixed group plays differently. It's not an essential effect of gender, though, but rather a matter of extremely heterogenic group composition - I could probably get a similar effect by having e.g. mixed nationalities. The reason that mixing in women into a game group tends to have this heterogenous effect is in the relatively monotonous demographics of ordinary game groups (same gender, same age, same people every week for years), which then leads to a degree of groupthink.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/r_donato" title="r_donato"><img alt="r_donato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/539/nGJ3PVU7WMVLV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/r_donato">r_donato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413796/#Comment_413796" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T19:58:16+00:00" title="May  8, 2013  7:58PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a rule of thumb: if the rule about changing intent in BDtP seems unnecessary because obviously everybody in this conflict has clear goals and they're just going to roll the dice until somebody gives way, then that's probably a much too routine and simple situation for BDtP.

The fight with the army kind of felt like BDTP. It had "fight choreography" where all the main characters were taking actions against the army, and I used my understanding of BDTP to inform the stakes setting. Dawn's thief was trying to sneak through the trees to get behind the army, and I thought to myself, "That's an opposed roll for bonus dice, her Stealth vs the army's Infantry." That was how we handled that entire scene, and it worked very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
