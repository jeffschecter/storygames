                    Here's my thesis: your chestnut bad-mechanic says something about you.<br/>
<br/>
The motivation: in the "Pistols at Dawn":http://www.nutkinland.com/forums/showthread.php?t=894 thing over at Nutkinland, the RPGPundit refers repeatedly to what he calls the "wheelbarrow of weapons" effect in Runequest.  Briefly, you get one advancement per weapon for the first successful use of that weapon in the session, so by implication you should carry around a whole armary to increase your skills.  Now, I played years of CoC and never felt that pressure, so there you go.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I tend to pan ??Amber?? because[1] an informed playgroup can end-run the character creation rules, and spend 4 points each to all have awesome stats and then go on to spend the rest of their points on other character resources.  I see this as a flaw, because the rules depend on the players being ignorant of the game text, and on the players being competitive with each other.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's your chestnut bad-mechanic, and why, and what do you suppose that says about you and your preferences?<br/>
<br/>
fn1. ...as I understand it...                </div>

                            I think mine would probably be the inevitable experience system in 99% of RPGs. In this system you start off the suck (or the awesome, but never the most awesome) and then face challanges to become the most awesome over time. Bascially, it's a mechanical incentive to start off a farm boy who turns into king of the world and walk down the god-aweful oversimplification of the Campbellian mono-myth. I hate that, and any game that uses a too direct implimentation of it will instantly earn my ire and hatred. <br/><br/>This, despite the fact that I know that many systems allow you to start at levels other than first, and that coming of age stories can be good stories. I think it simply has to do with the fact that in many games its become an assumed, and ties experience to acheiving goals rather than to making choices. <br/><br/><br/>Judson, <br/><br/>The Amber thing, BTW, tends to not work out well because "rankings" in stats in Amber mostly only apply to the PCs and (maybe) members of their generation. You still get compared in raw numbers to creatures of other courts and elder Amberites. So you may spend 4 pts to be first in warfare and rock all of your siblings asses, but every single elder Amberite will then boot you around the room while giggling.                        </div>

                            As a very long-term GM of RQ, I'd say that while I've seen the effect Pundit refers to, in the long run it doesn't matter, because it's a poor strategy (better to concentrate hard on one or two weapons). Also, it's lame. <br/><br/>Me, I can't stand D&amp;D alignment. It's a shitty representation of both real life and complex fantasy. In game it's clunky and abuse-prone. Out of game it's politically crap--it's a bad teacher of the young, for a start.<br/><br/>Feel free to analyse.                        </div>

<p><em>Amber</em> again.  It's old, it's got chestnuts.</p>
<p>All adjudication (<strong>all</strong>) is done by a system where there are numbers, and the guide says "Well, these numbers should usually determine the outcome of the conflict, unless the GM thinks that the roleplaying on the other side is really, really good."</p>
<p>In practice this means that the pushiest, most manipulative, most artistic player wins everything, no matter what happens in the rules system.  I know, because it's the system that showed me the power of pushy manipulation in concert with artistry.</p>
<p>I totally agree with the OP that the chestnuts we remember are the ones that speak to quirks of our character.</p>

<p>I like alignment! It tells you what end of the sword to offer to someone.</p>
<p>I don't like Amber, for above reasons. My chestnut is Amber's <em>stuff.</em> I have no clue what to do with this. It might as well not <em>be</em> there. I like mechanics that tell me how to use them, and interface with the rest in sensible ways.</p>

                            Judson, <br/><br/>Oh yea, I have issues with Amber. Though many of them may be based around the fact that I'm not sure if Amber is doing it on purpouse or not -- a game about dysfunctional relationships where people try and use underhanded methods of reality warping to screw each other that sets up a paradigm where the players become involved in dysfunctional relationships where they try to use underhanded methods of game warping to screw each other? I'm not sure it isn't a work of genius.                        </div>

<p>In "Mage: the Ascension", I really felt their Paradox rules were fighting against what the game was cool about. On one hand, I understand: Paradox is the cost of your hubris against reality, and it encouraged you towards subtle magical effects rather then big scale magic, and so on. And yet, I got this feeling (1) we were playing Mages, and (2) we were penalized for making magic! The GMs were often suggesting we find non-magical ways to accomplish goals, but... Magic! Mage! Ah!</p>
<p>What this says is that I have a low threshold for a game system preventing me from doing what I think is cool, probably a bit too low.</p>

<p>Dev, I totally agree. And it's not just you: the game promises something, looks to be about stuff, and then a) prevents you from doing it and b) makes your moral decision for you: if you use vulgar magic, They will get you. That makes the only interesting story one of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>I've got a lot of grumbly stories about rules, but I'll just say a couple off the top of my head:</p>
<p>In Warhammer, D&amp;D, GURPS, and probably some others, immunity to poison is an economical and obvious choice for anyone in a court setting. Which invalidates poison completely, which means you can't really do cloak and dagger stuff. Particularly since, in two of those systems, it's practically impossible to kill someone with a dagger. It's all about open combat. (In GURPS, you can make a called shot at a reasonable cost to stick 'em somewhere good).</p>
<p>Any rule that says "These are the rules, except when the GM says something else, and the GM is responsible for opposition, mediation, arbitration, and everyone's fun." That's totally butt and nonsensical prima fascia. It's the elephant in the room of most game systems. It's why there's a GM's screen, which is a complete admission that the rules don't work and are just there to make you feel like there's systsemic support for stuff.</p>

                            JoshAC, I totally second that about the GM rules. I really dislike games which do that.<br/>
<br/>
The 3rd ed DM screen is actually kinda useful, IMO, since the one side contains various frequently-referenced tables and means the DM doesn't have to keep grabbing books back from the players to look things up.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I have to say I really disliked the character advancement system in a homebrew a friend of mine made. It was a stat+skill+2d10 thing. Every 10 you rolled, you got one *point* towards improving that skill. The number of points required to improve a skill was 60 divided by your Learn score. (Learn was in the 1-10 range.) Characters basically did not advance--in 3 months of weekly sessions, one character increased their Sense: Sight skill by one point. There was no other systemic way for characters to change. This really bugged me! (The game was, in general, horribly dysfunctional, but this was one thing about the system that stood out for me.)                        </div>

                            I always thought it was to hide dice.  So the players never really knew if they made their Spot Check or not.  Maybe there really <em>were</em> harpies up in the hills....                        </div>

<p>Hiding your mapped out adventure can be done with notebook technology. But yes, it's for hiding everything the GM does. Which is everything.</p>
<p>I mean, Josh, it means the players don't "make spot checks". The GM decides if they see stuff or not.</p>
<p>What's the point of rolling dice if it's a) on the honor of the player to say whether a roll was made or not and b) it's the responsibility of that player to generate fun for the other players?</p>

<p>It's a smokescreen, because "this doesn't matter" is apparently unsayable/unthinkable.</p>
