You don't spend 6-8 hours on your D&amp;D4e character because you /need/ to, you do it because you *want* to.  It's called lonely fun, and some of us like it.

People are a whole, not convient parts that you can't be criticized for looking down upon.  <br/><br/>I'm watching the videos now, and its interesting. I wonder how much the preponderance of hats, goatees, asians (lol) and slim glasses are a correlation of New York as apposed to gamers. <br/><br/>I know my wife will be very happy to find a female GM interview. I know she definitely feels underrepresented as a female in the hobby, and has taken a kind of perverse joy in finding other examples of females in the hobby (her (very rarely attended) con lists are now populated by what has a female gm, etc, etc. <br/><br/>That said she oddly enough, hates games about gender. <br/><br/>I also find it interesting the kinda preponderance of views, as the entertainer, as the gamer, the view of DM's who kill, The Director, and stuff like that. I know because I fall into a few of these that they are definitely complex (my players all think I'm going to kill them, they want to think that because I don't really, even if I do let the dice fall where they will (which is not some gamism code for gamism, because i'm still composing the encounters, which is how they think I kill them). I wonder if its the combination of the unknowable (luck, results based on chance) and the unknowable (what i'm going to think of next, how i'm going to kill them next) that leads to the almost mythologicization of the killer dm. <br/><br/>I find it interesting. <br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252101/#Comment_252101" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T12:59:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 12:59PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;You keep saying, but I ain't believing it. People are a whole, not convient parts that you can't be criticized for looking down upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting that you seem so intent upon acusing me of criticizing or looking down upon people. I have said only a couple of things about the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) There were a lot of obese people in the videos. This is a fact that was observed by more than me.<br/>\n2) I am not surrounded by that many obese gamers. You will just have to trust me on that. So this surprised me.<br/>\n3) I am saddened at the fact that our demographic would be so obese. We are relatively young, and for someone to be obese at this age means a lot of bad things down the road. Not necessarily for everyone, but definitely for the majority.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no judgement about them as people. I am saddened because I see them as people who have what is really a medical problem. It is not their fault any more than it is the fault of a child with cystic fibrosis is at fault, despite what the mainstream media would have you believe. They just have consequences to look forward to. That is what saddens me. I do not look down upon them, but to say that they wouldn't be better off, all things being otherwise equal, without the extra weight is a denial of reality. So it saddnes me that this is a burdan that they will have to carry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also telling of your feelings about the subject that you would assume my feelings about the subject. I hold no ill will toward obese people, even though I would wish that they were not, for their own sake. Obesity is one of the leading causes of death and ill health in the US. To not be saddened by it would be similar to not being saddened by people not using seat belts, or not being vaccinized. It causes problems that would be dramatically decreased otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252169/#Comment_252169" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T21:33:45+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  9:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its interesting that WotC asks all of them about how and when they decided to "become" a DM.

Its also that way to other things (like 4th edition in particular) There were a couple of OMG  I can't believe they are giving this the time of day, in regards to complaints of 4th edition, but they just push on and end up with how everyone was pretty okay with it at the end. <br/><br/>As for nameless, its number 3&gt; that I am critizing you for.

I might come off quite differently than I mean to, and really, my perspectie might be something that many people find less than desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a little context, I am a medical student in the middle of a primary care clerkship. I am eyeball deep in trying to convince people to lose weight, eat better, exercise, stop smoking, cut down on the drinking and drugs, and be generally more careful about what they participate in, especially sex. All of those things can be valuable parts of the human experience, but my job at this point is to convince people to only engage in them to a degree that will not adversely affect their health. Sometimes when I get online I let it all hang out and just vent a little, and sometimes this might not come off well. It's a tough business I am in, selling what is generally a less fun lifestyle for the opportunity of more of it later. Generally much later. I actually can already tell that I am not really cut out for primary care, because frankly, I do not really want to have to work to convince people to do things that they are just not into. Seeing this dicussion, I have learned that even pointing out that there might be a problem could be offensive to people, and that might explain why it rarely works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I will have to basically change my attitude a little. From now on I will keep my opinions on this matter to my self. I will respect your right to the lifestyle of your choice, even while as a doctor, I will have to advise you should change in an effort to avoid the negative health consequences. I will not avoid the facts, but I will avoid as much as possible making people feel like I look down on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is even somewhat beside the point, because I know that there is more to it than lifestyle when it comes to weight. I just got distracted when you compared it to strictly lifestyle choices like smoking and risky sexual behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252287/#Comment_252287" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T22:15:41+00:00" title="January 23, 2010 10:15PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can debate all day if it is offensive or not, but a lot of gamers are overweight (or really overweight, which stands out in people's minds more.)

If I'm not exercising, I'm literally gaining 1 lb or more a week. I've been 250 lbs before and I'm 5'11'. I've gained 10 lbs since joining the forum (which was not too long ago.)  I need to hit the gym (more regularly) and work it off.  If I was in that video and 75 lbs overweight (like I have been) I would find it really weird that you guys would say its offensive to call me overweight.

At my twice-a-month D&amp;D game I run in the shop, we have 1 guy who you'd look at peg as definitely overweight, but probably not obese... he's big, but still in decent shape, bikes in, etc. The other five people in the game, and me, are median weight or under. BUT... I live in an affluent Northeastern small city where the population as a whole ins wealthier and healthier than in the Midwest or the South. <br/><br/>And let's face it, it's not like if you go to, say, a football game, or a poker tournament, that you're necessarily going to find a much healthier bunch if you take a random sampling. You'll sure find "at least one guy standing around who's 50+ pounds overweight". ANY sedentary activity performed as a hobby is going to attract less active people, and in turn leave less time for physical activity the more you engage in it. But there's also a little bit of begging the question there, like saying "Wow, the running hobby sure has a lot of people with ankle and other joint problems. What's up with that? Yeesh!"<br/><br/>That said, the image of 'lifestyle' gamers are likelier than not to be overweight, white, and male tracks with my experience at Cons. I'd be curious to learn HOW WotC found their sample of gaming groups. It's clear they made an effort to find a female GM. Did they go equally out of their way to sample different areas on income/education levels for the rest of their interviewees? As someone pointed out re: hats and goatees, a game table in a loft in Bensonhurst is very likely to look as different to a group in rural Kentucky as any sapling of those populations, or indeed, the places themselves, do.<br/><br/>On the subject of the impossible, apparently contradictory demands/requirements for 'good DMs', well, that's just people. Ask people what they think of politicians (or bosses, or even clergy) and you could probably just dub in the same answers (up to and INCLUDING the 'I hate it when they try to kill us' reaction, I bet...).
