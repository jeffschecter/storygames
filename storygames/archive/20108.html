The theme of the game is what sells it. If lighthearted barbarian hijinks sound like a good time to you then you will like this game."<br/><br/>"I think this game starts off on the right foot and keeps on going... This game is meant to be fun and light hearted with lots of barbarian smashy goodness and alien lizards."<br/><br/>"BARBARIANS VERSUS has now become my choice for any PARTY RPG. Let's face it, any game with rules for how much liquor your barbarian can drink is a party game... Fun is the watchword here people. Just a helluva lot of fun."</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
