Cam has stated on the Cortex boards that it only becomes a Contest if someone else wants to counter it with a related Ability, or if two people want to activate conflicting Special Effects at the same time. So in those cases it's a Contest to see which character gets to use the SFX, and the winner then spends a Plot Point and the SFX, once again, just happens, without its own Contest to determine the effect. I got the feeling that you can still, while rolling an Ability die within a Contest, narrate like, whatever, with your power (try to catch bullets? Fine! T ry to knock a foe away? great!), but it just doesn't have the automatic, decisive effect that a Plot Point SFX does.<br><br>Now, the above has seemed a little wonky to me, but not without a certain logic. And it's about the only way having SFX at all makes sense to me...otherwise it's an unwelcome, simulation-y  intrusion in an otherwise smoothly narrative conflict system.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315662/#Comment_315662" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T17:01:51+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  5:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS.

Thanks for posting that Joel. This is essentially how we ended up playing last Wednesday. There were several times where an obstacle could have been a contest but we spent a Power Point to activate an ability's special effect to circumvent the obstacle completely. It worked well because it made Plot Points even more valuable and allowed us to fast forward to even more interesting contests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315680/#Comment_315680" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T21:03:30+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  9:03PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not really a Contest if you're not picking up dice, yeah.

Most of the time, speedsters are doing that. It's how Flash somehow keeps getting smacked, tripped, clobbered, etc even though he should technically be faster than anything on the planet. He just doesn't spend the PP all the time, he's rolling the die into his Contests instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the whole point of SFX is to handwave stuff that would be stupidly annoying to roll dice for and which are for the most part massive fiction edits in your favor. Hence Super-Strength's throwing a truck into next week for a PP, or Flight's joining a scene. The game doesn't really care how many tons you can lift if you're Super-Strong, only how dramatically important it is at any given point that you're stronger than normal people.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315682/#Comment_315682" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T21:36:28+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  9:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>It's not really a Contest if you're not picking up dice, yeah.

I'm literally reaching for my dice.<br><br>"I punch her out of the scene?" he asks, ponying up the Plot Point.<br><br>"Okay." I say, and poof! Mystique is gone, just as if they'd battled and she lost, with one exception: she has not suffered any Stress.<br><br>She came (almost) right back at him two scenes later.<br><br>Using Plot Points/Special FX to bypass confrontations is not tactically a good idea, because both getting and inflicting Stress is good.
