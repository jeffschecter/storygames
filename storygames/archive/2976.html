For the moment, it's just musings on what goes through my mind when confronted by a player who <em>begs</em> you to laser shark a game. Anyone who has similar stories and how they resolved the issue is free to do so.</p>\n<pre><code>**EDIT**: The term "laser shark" or "lasershark" (not really sure whether\nwe should use it as a compound word or not) is an allusion to the movie\n"Austin Powers", where Dr. Evil at one point says he want a death trap\ncontaining a shark with a laser beam on its head. Neither a shark nor a\nlaser beam was awesome enough; it had to be *both*. By analogy,\n"lasersharking" is any combination of multiple "awesome" elements to\ncreate a hypothetically *more* awesome element.\n\nThe term came out of a specific gamer community, but the concept is\nnot really RPG-specific; I've seen Ken Hite use the term "Frankenstein"\nin reference to The Venture Brothers cartoon series, for example, and\nit's a common technique in comedy writing, especially in satirical\ncomedy like "The Simpsons" (where a motorcycle daredevil had to jump\na tank filled not just with sharks, but also a lion.) The term "mashup"\nsort of means the same thing, but doesn't convey the sense of absurdity\nthat "lasersharking" does.\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, at one of the noise shows, a fellow noise performer found out that I design tabletop RPGs and said that he and his friend have played CRPGs and always wanted to play a D&amp;D-like tabletop game, but haven't been able to. We've been discussing actually doing this soon.</p>\n<p>His friend was at a more recent show, so I asked them more specifically what kind of story or movie are they thinking of as the kind of things they'd like to see. The noise artist didn't say anything specific, but his friend said he didn't want straight fantasy or science fiction, but something more like "fighting prostitutes, but with magical powers". Something with classes, although he wasn't specific. Something like "Sin City, but with magic".</p>\n<p>My response was "O-kay..." The noise artist just kind of laughed, like he wasn't sure how this would work out.</p>\n<p>Now, the guy who's eager to play a fighting prostitute with magical powers might just be the kind of person who likes to say/do intentionally shocking things to see if he gets a reaction. But I'm assuming here that he really wants fighting prostitutes. I have two ideas on how to approach this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just play octaNe in a fighting-magical-prostitute setting, maybe with a couple minor rules to shift the focus towards fighting prostitutes. Advantage: minimal work. Disadvantage: I had wanted to playtest my own games, rather than run octaNe. But then, maybe a couple sessions of octaNe would be a good lead-in to something else. Also, if he's expecting CRPG-like classes and skill trees, octaNe might not fulfill that need.</li>\n<li>Modify my in-progress space patrol game to set it in a gritty modern-day world with rules about prostitution and magic. Advantage: I do get to playtest a game. Disadvantage: I have to create the rules. Also, if he just wants fighting prostitutes because he wants sexual incidents, he probably won't be happy with my attempts to link tantric sex to magical power, limited by the risk of falling in love.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another worry is that, like most laser sharked concepts, it won't be as interesting to play as it is to toss out in a brainstorming session. Fighting magical prostitutes sound amusing, but they will probably be less amusing in actual practice.</p>\n<p>I'm sure I'll have more to say on this later.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67664/#Comment_67664" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T17:28:49+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  5:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they haven't played a rpg before, I think you should suggest that they play a stock rpg without any crazy prostitution modification to get a hang of how to play.

For two reasons:<br/><br/>1.  A game in playtest is probably less reliable than games you know work pretty well.<br/><br/>2.  These guys are gaming-virgins.  In a way, that's good b/c they have fresh eyes, and if they don't understand something it's because it's genuinely unclear.  But in a way that's bad, because you're going to be stepping in to hold their hand through everything anyway, and so they're less likely to give you useful data.  You won't know if the rules make sense to others or not, because you'll be doing 90% of everything anyway.<br/><br/>I'd recommend starting them with something else.  If it turns out they like table-top gaming, say, "Hey listen, I'm designing this thing, I'd really like to test it.  It's in an experimental stage, maybe it will stink, but I can't fix it until I see it in action."  But I think that's a pitch to make once they've got their toes wet in the activity.<br/><br/>As for gaming systems: <br/>1.  Primetime Adventures one-shot.  Easy and versatile.  Pitch for 30 minutes, see if "fighting prostitutes" shows up.<br/>2.  Sorcerer.  Bad-ass but also deep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67685/#Comment_67685" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T20:21:00+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  8:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm not going to buy/learn something new just for these guys, so Primetime Adventures and Unknown Armies are right out. Sorcerer? Hadn't thought of that. Not sure I would run it. These guys are definitely not looking for deep. I <em>had</em> thought of Trollbabe. Essentially, just change the background. I would need to define what the two worlds are that the fighting magical prostitutes are caught between, though. I mainly haven't been focusing on Trollbabe because there isn't anything even vaguely resembling character classes, so it's a less perfect fit for what they want.</p>\n<p>Selling them on another setting immediately? That just doesn't sound right. I want to gain their trust first, then use that credibility to pitch the next game. It wouldn't be Star Wars. I want to enjoy myself, too.</p>\n<p>I'm not completely ruling out playtesting, because at this stage I'm not going to ask them deep questions about the game anyways. Just "Did you like it? Do you get it?" But you guys raise some valid concerns.</p>\n<p>However, I'm really leaning towards octaNe now, perhaps with the Grindhouse mod Jared posted here. It already fits. Change the setting to modern day and focus on fighting magical prostitutes, come up with a bunch of roles that reflect that setting, and we're good to go. The rules are <em>made</em> for the kind of play they want.</p>\n<p>C. W.: "laser sharkers" is my freshly-coined name for people who like to lasershark. In other words, pile awesome on top of awesome to make some Frankenstein setting or character. The problem with laser sharking is that it's only really fun if the game supports laser sharking as part of play -- which octaNe does support, in spades.

I'm thinking of things like:<br/><br/>- Mortal Coil<br/>- Primetime Adventures (c.f. Remi's Sextricity game from Nerdly)<br/>- A PDQ Variant<br/>- Risus<br/>- (plug alert!)

I've generally handled over-the-top player requests by giving it to them, but then attaching strings or add to the concept.  So, for example, in a college game one player wanted to be Farslayer -- the psychic who could kill anyone in the world with his mind if he could uniquely identify them.  He got that, but the victims also knew who was killing them (via the psychic link) and didn't die instantly.

There are nicer ways to handle player requests for sandwiches than just giving them turd sandwiches instead.<br/><br/>I see several approaches, which I will try to enumerate:<br/><br/><b>If they asks for sharks with lasers...</b><br/><br/>1. ...say no. Tell them they can have sharks, or they can have lasers, but not lasersharks.<br/><br/>2. ...say yes. But the lasers misfire and the sharks tend to eat the wrong people, so they're crappy lasersharks.<br/><br/>3. ...say yes. And run with it, which requires understanding why they think lasersharks are neat in the first place.<br/><br/>I used to do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, as a gamemaster. Then I thought I had to do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, because that was my responsibility as a responsible GM. I had to teach them to be responsible players by showing them that their desire for lasersharks was wrong and bad, by making their fictional lives suck since they asked for lasersharks.<br/><br/>Now I am leaning a lot more towards <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. I think that failure to understand my players and what they'd enjoy is a worse sin than allowing lasersharks into a game. I think that enforcing the unfun on someone because they don't share my vision of fun is wrong, and only shows my own closemindedness. I think failure to grasp why lasersharks are fun shows that I'm not willing to listen to my friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68555/#Comment_68555" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T14:06:16+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  2:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further addition:<br/><br/>I think I see the "lasersharking problem" as not being at all about the validity of mashups, but rather about how to handle player requests which you don't really understand or see the fun of. It's a problem with inability to connect between what makes a game fun for one person, and what makes it fun for another.<br/><br/>When GMs are expressing a preference for one type of game, they are saying "this is what I think will be fun" but it's not explicitly stated in that way usually, nor is the fun described. And when players are expressing a preference for other types of fun, which don't fit the GM's vision, you get conflict because again, the traditional gaming structure doesn't make these kinds of discussions explicit.<br/><br/>Here's my story of realizing what was fun and what was not.<br/><br/>I was running a superhero game with my usual group of gamers. Marvel Super-Heroes. (That alone should tell you how long ago this was; I believe we were in high school, or I was just out of it.)<br/><br/>The setup was that the Avengers, X-Men, FF, Spidey, etc. never made it back from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars" rel="nofollow">Secret Wars</a>, thus leaving room for the player characters to become Earth's mightiest heroes. So they all made up relatively powerful folks, including one guy, who I'll call J, who made up a fellow named Xorn with earth powers.<br/><br/>Part of the campaign backstory was that a group of second-stringers had reformed as the Avengers, after the real team went missing and never returned. Beta Ray Bill, Black Knight, Hercules, a few others were the "official Avengers team." And our heroes went to visit them, and just as they did, the Avengers mansion got blown up. Fortunately the b-list official team was away, but came back just to see the rubble of their home and the player characters standing there.<br/><br/>A fight ensued, this being Marvel, and then they realized they were all good guys. They resolved to figure out in the morning what to do, working together. But for now, the Avengers were lacking homes. Oh no! So they paired up, one Avenger and one player character, to figure out what to do with the evening. (Okay, so maybe the pairing up and splitting into sub-teams is more JLA/JSA teamup, but that's not the point of this story.)<br/><br/>M was playing a radioactive solid-energy form. He loved spicy food, and dragged the Black Knight off to eat stuff that made him sick. W was playing a mild-mannered junior accountant who could turn into a huge crystaline brick, like a gemstone Colossus, and Hercules dragged the hapless fellow off to a bar for "drinking and wenching!"<br/><br/>J, the guy who played Xorn, was assigned to Beta Ray Bill or someone, but didn't want to hang out with him. Instead he went back to the Avengers mansion and used his earth powers to move dirt around. And I was getting annoyed by this.<br/><br/>What was going on here?<br/><br/>Nobody was asking for lasersharks, but here we have a pretty clear case of different players wanting different things. (I'm not a GNS theory wonk, so I am not going to start assigning creative agendas.)<br/><br/>The GM, me, wanted to tell little stories about the mismatch of characters and so on, and contrast various character types against each other, while amusing myself by using minor and quirky Marvel heroes.<br/><br/>M wanted to explore something amusing about the implications of his character's physiology and how it was reflected in his personality.<br/><br/>W was sort of roped into the bar scene, but it was designed specifically to play off the established persona for his character, and he enjoyed bantering with Hercules and playing the straight man.<br/><br/>J? J wanted to move dirt. And I had no fucking idea why. In fact, J complained that W and M were "wasting time" by giving food poisoning to Avengers or taking love life advice from demigod superheroes. He wanted to move dirt.<br/><br/>So what did I do? I let him move dirt. In previous games, I would shoot down his requests for lasersharks, or I would serve him shit sandwiches disguised as lasershark filets ("okay, FINE, you can be a half-ogre..." and then I proceed to make his life miserable for wanting it), but this time I just went with it. Okay, it's important to him. He'll move some dirt.<br/><br/>So I turned to him and said, "J, make a roll for your Earth Control power." And he rolled. And cried out happily, "A green result!" (Meaning: A success.) "Okay! You move a pretty big hunk of dirt, clearing some of the debris away from the blast site." I smiled at him, he smiled at me, and made a little mark on his character sheet for no real reason.<br/><br/>...then I turned back to M and roleplayed the Black Knight puking on him. Then I turned to W, and Hercules tried to push him forward to an attractive "wench" at the bar. Then I came back to J, and continued doing this between the other scenes.<br/><br/>"J, roll again!" "Another green!" "Alright! You move more dirt!"<br/><br/>(time passes) "Okay, meanwhile, back at Avengers Mansion... I need another roll, J!" "A RED result!" (Meaning: The best success possible.) "Wow, you moved a LOT of dirt."<br/><br/>And he was happy. He didn't complain at all after that. He thought he was doing something useful and needed by moving dirt.<br/><br/>"Moving dirt" has been come a bit of personal jargon for me and my gaming groups. It means "anything a player wants to do that is ultimately pointless in the GM's eyes, except that it seems to make the player really happy to do it, and thus it should not be fought."<br/><br/>It's sort of like "say yes or roll dice" -- the principle being that I don't need to UNDERSTAND why he wants to do it. If it won't hurt, if it won't throw off the game, if it will be fun for him, then I certainly don't need to stand in his way, make it complicated and unfun, or convince him not to do it. It's fun, he's enjoying it, so "say yes!"<br/><br/>"Moving dirt" illustrates, for me, the need for the GM to step back from making it all about HIS sense of fun, and incorporate players' senses as well. And doing it without dystopic twisting, without the whole "be careful what you wish for!" nonsense that's just passive-aggression cloaked in gamemaster clothing.<br/><br/>To me, it's the same conflict as "lasersharking;" being willing to accept that other folks might have MORE fun eating ice cream than eating steak, if I can introduce YET ANOTHER metaphor.

Good point!  <br/><br/>I don't think I actually did that with Farslayer.  That is, Farslayer was still a cool character even given the limitations, and I think Ron was reasonably pleased with him.  However, I agree that the above is a huge problem.  It can be good to provide additional input to get something that both you and the other player are happy with, but doing so can easily kill the cool of the original idea.  <br/><br/>Actually, upon reflection, I do recall an issue with genre mixing.  In the first season of our Buffy campaign, the GM Bill, who was a huge Japanese anime fan, included a bunch of references to anime that most of us didn't get.  We just ended up asking him to tone it down, which he did.  So that'd be an example of your approach <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but I agree that it is tricky.  In any case, this was players to the GM rather than GM to a player, so it isn't exactly what talysman asked about though it is related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68560/#Comment_68560" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T14:12:21+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  2:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, that is a great story. I have had players choose to move dirt many times in my games. I want to stand up and scream at them as loud as I can with my hands pulling on my hair as hard as I can but I restrain myself. Afterwards I have heard from them 'damn that was fun'. I hate anime smileys, but: <br/><br/>O.O<br/><br/>One reason I didn't think that doing an 'intro game' for new players was out of line is because I sort of interpret the enthusiasm for a big complicated game concept as being on par with "Hey, let's play chess for the first time, I heard the Queen's Indian Defense is rad, let's do that!" My response is "let's make sure we know how the horsies move first, THEN we'll do that."

I didn't start this thread so that people could bring out their lingering grudges against each other.</p>\n<p>I posted this thread in Gaming (+), which has the following description:</p>\n<pre><code>This is discussion geared towards improving the gaming experience\nas a player (or GM), independent of system. In short, Making Gaming\nMore Fun. Tips, tricks, processes, 'craft', spotty ideas and random\nmusings are the order of the day. System-specific tips and tools are\nkosher.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not criticizing lasersharking, here. I did worry about that one guy's <em>motive</em> for lasersharking, because if he was just throwing in the prostitutes bit because he thought it made him sound edgy, he's not going to actually want to play a prostitute. However, for the purposes of this thread, I am taking him at his word, and I am discussing <em>giving him what he wants</em>. This discussion is not about negotiation or finding a middle ground, it's not about different ideas of what is fun, it's about techniques for taking that initial lasersharked idea and making it actually work, as opposed to being a mere throwaway gag.</p>\n<p>The problem with this specific example, as I've said, is that what makes a lasersharked idea sound awesome is the surprise and novelty of that idea often doesn't carry over into play. Once the surprise wears off, what do you have? The approach I'm taking to this problem is to actually lasershark further, in a sense. I've got these prostitutes, and they fight. And they also use magic. How do I keep that entertaining, beyond that initial concept? In my mind, it's a matter of grafting on a <em>reason</em> to fight and a <em>reason</em> to be prostitutes. For the latter, I'm going to tie their magical powers to tantric sex magic. They become prostitutes because it's a way to gain magical power. Also, I'm tying the prostitution and the fighting together, making this a secret order dedicated to overthrowing the patriarchy. They're not just prostitutes because of the sex magic angle, but because prostitution gives them a way to control male politicians and methods of spying on and infiltrating the patriarchy. I'll throw in a few ideas from The SCUM Manifesto, too, and this should give the initial lasersharked idea some legs to run with.</p>\n<p>What I would like to see is how other people took a lasersharked idea and kept it from going stale. Let's trade tips and tricks, here. Matt's right that awesome piled on top of awesome can be fun, but isn't always; given that, and given that you've made a commitment to deliver on an awesome-squared concept, what methods have you used to make that concept live up to its promise?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
