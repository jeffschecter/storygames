To start, I suppose I will define setting as "the time and place in which stuff happens." <br/>Specifically, what I want to discuss is how you, as a GM (or, possibly, as a player) go about using setting description to a: establish the mood of the place, and b: tie the action into the place. <br/><br/>IaWA specifically states that the GM should give at least one concrete description of something each scene. I like that. I've been meaning to use that in my games, though I don't think I've been doing the best job of it. I feel a concrete description will make the world a little more vivid, and avoid the feeling that the action could take place anywhere, without losing anything. That concrete description will also help to alleviate the problem of "a picture is worth a thousand words." I'm working on a short story right now, and I'm about to take this very advice and apply it to the story, as I feel the settings are under-described at the moment, and that a single sentence of description for each place will probably fix that, and tie the action into the scene. <br/><br/>In <i>Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering</i>, Robin Laws also recommends something similar, as well. He even suggests to keep a list of useful descriptors on hand to help. I've been meaning to make a couple lists and try this out. Anyone tried this, or anything similar?<br/><br/>It's especially difficult to establish mood, I think. I mean, you want a festival to feel different then a sewer, right? But how? I don't really have any suggestions here. It's been stumping me for weeks. For example, there is a city in my BW campaign that is both massive and, literally, alive. I want the players to <i>feel</i> it as a living, breathing, entity. I think establishing some kind of mood would help. V:TM books talked a lot about this, but as with most everything else, never gave any good concrete advice. It was all candles, capes, and Bauhaus.  <br/><br/>I'm not really intending for this to be another "help Ryan run his games" thread, which I've made about three of since I've been here. I'm hoping for more of a discussion sort of thing. So, yeah, have at it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169807/#Comment_169807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T06:16:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  6:16AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience: <br/><br/>It doesn't take much, since the players are already busily filling in the void with their own imaginings. But everyone at the table needs some common hooks so they are reassured they're all on the same page.<br/><br/>As a GM, I start every scene with a very brief description, and I try and hit two or three senses. So for your "massive city" story? If I start a scene with the characters walking through the city, it might be as quick as, "Okay, so the city is noisy as hell even though it's just after dawn. The buildings are so tall that it's going to be dark down on the street until noon. The crowd stinks of spices, and it's rubbing off on you as you walk." Go on much longer and it starts to feel like story time, with all the players sitting around passively listening.<br/><br/>For me, the primary utility of description and mood is to give the scenes -- and, ultimately, arising conflicts and player decisions -- context. So think some about what you, the GM, want a scene to be "about," and let that guide the quantity and quality of your descriptions.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170511/#Comment_170511" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T11:18:35+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 11:18AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are two tricks I'm fond of:<br/><br/>1. Try to get the players to anticipate whatever is coming up, sensually. This gets people's imaginations wired more deeply into what you're trying to describe. <br/><br/>For example, let's say you're describing the characters walking down the street and approaching a fish market. Before you even mention the market, a few minutes earlier, tell them something like, "you can smell fried fish on the wind". Then, when you describe the fish market, they've been expecting it, and it feels natural and powerful--the earlier details make sense in a coherent whole.<br/><br/>2. Set yourself some arbitrary themes, whether for the whole setting, for a particular location, or for the session. I don't mean themes like "literary themes" but more like "common motifs" with respect to the setting's colour. Take two items of appearance and tie them completely arbitrarily to two matters of the deeper nature of thing described.<br/><br/>For instance, you might say:<br/><br/>"Places, people or things that are dangerous are clean, new, organized, and efficient."<br/>"Places, people of things that are safe and friendly are dirty, broken-down, or messy and disorganized."<br/><br/>Don't tell your players--keep the notes to yourself. These will help you improvise both content and description during the game.<br/><br/>In play, you may find yourself using these "themes" in two different ways:<br/><br/>Nature -&gt; Description<br/><br/>Example 1: The players enter the office of the Mayor. You happen to know that the Mayor is planning to throw them in jail. Knowing that, it's easy to add a few details about how well-dressed and groomed he is, how organized his desk, and how orderly and efficient his staff or servants are.<br/><br/>Description -&gt; Nature<br/><br/>Example 2: The players enter a room deeper in the dungeon. On whim, you decide to describe it as filthy and full of rats. Following your chosen themes, this tells you that the room is a safe hiding place, at least for now. Maybe it's rarely patrolled by the guards--which makes sense: that's probably why it's so filthy!<br/><br/>The players are likely to begin associating those things subconsciously--if they meet a warrior in shining, brand new armour, they might get nervous.<br/><br/>Later, in important circumstances or a pivotal moment in the story, intentionally break the themes you've set up for extra effect!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
