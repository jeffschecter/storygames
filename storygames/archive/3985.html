I posted these questions in that thread but then I thought I'd post them in their own since others might be interested.<br/><br/>1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?<br/>2) What mechanical resources do the players have at hand to affect the outcome? How do those mechanical resources manifest in the fiction.<br/>3) Once a conflict is resolved how is the outcome measured both mechanically and within the fiction?<br/>4) How does the mechanical answer to 3 feed back into the mechanical answer for 2? How does the fiction impact of 3 feed back into the answer for 1?<br/><br/>Now I admit these questions I think slant slightly towards a bias I have in favor of conflict heavy, rapidly evolving, cyclical mechanical economy games.  I do X which results in Y which directly impacts what the next X is.<br/><br/>So for designers and players do these questions interest/resonate with you?  Any games for which these questions don't apply or better any games for which these questions don't apply and that does not reflect a flaw in the design?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89278/#Comment_89278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T18:10:46+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  6:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if the term "conflict" is starting to feel a bit loaded in our world.<br/><br/>I had something like this on one of my earlier episodes of Master Plan, where I said something like:  Mechanics serve to answer questions.  What questions do (you want) your mechanics to answer, and how do (you want) your mechanics to answer them?  With the parentheticals, they're design-oriented questions, but I could see them being post-production questions otherwise.<br/><br/>I know that I couldn't easily answer your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> with Know Thyself, because "Uh, what the players argue about" is a crap (but maybe true) answer.  Then again, it's not set in any genre or setting to focus the answer further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89283/#Comment_89283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T18:29:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  6:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm trying to answer these questions for <a href="http://unwrittencontinuum.com/" rel="nofollow">unWritten</a>, however, I'm struggling. Probably not because of the inadequacy of the questions, but because of my lack of understanding or expressing game theory.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?</blockquote>\nSuccess, consequences, how you act, and who narrates are what is at stake. You roll the dice, but you are limited by the values of the dice, so you must decie which one of those 4 items gets which die.\n<blockquote>2) What mechanical resources do the players have at hand to affect the outcome? How do those mechanical resources manifest in the fiction.</blockquote>\nThe players have traits and cues, these increase the chances to get the desired roll, however, those traits can only come into play if they work with your intended action and only one cue can come in at a time, once used the cue cannot be reused. Once you've placed the dice with the desired square it directly affect the fiction (aka if  you place a high die in the success conflict square you succeed.)\n<blockquote>3) Once a conflict is resolved how is the outcome measured both mechanically and within the fiction?</blockquote>\nmeasured mechanically? do you mean something like hit points? My game doesn't have anything like hit points. once you resolve the conflict the players have to deal with the results of the conflict as it affects the fiction. I'm not sure where to go with this.\n<blockquote>4) How does the mechanical answer to 3 feed back into the mechanical answer for 2? How does the fiction impact of 3 feed back into the answer for 1?</blockquote>\nNor this?<br/><br/>So you have 4 questions that directly relate to the mechanics, but make no mention of setting. Are you then not concerned with setting? If these are the only things you would consider when it comes to purchasing a game then you only look at the mechanics?<br/><br/>This is interesting, I actually agree with you (if I understood you correctly) more then I care to admit, only because I buy things, knowing I would never play it for the setting material (though this isn't my only criteria for buying a game.) Though I only play games that offer a good "mechanical experience" in providing the type of game that it says it provides?<br/><br/>Any of this make sense?

In fact, I mean it here as a loaded word.  I'm fully willing to admit that I think my questions greatly reflect my personal preferences or biases.  For example, I really dislike simple "Conch Shell Mechanics" where the mechanics decide NOTHING about the actual fiction, they only decide who among the players gets to speak or decide.  So, if the mechanics do not resolve conflicts that arise within the fiction between the fictional characters something else about the game really has to grab me.<br/><br/>To answer Alex with regard to question 3, I find question 3 is often absent and yet I consider it rather vital to my enjoyment.  Hit points would be a weak example, yes.  However, Fallout in Dogs is better.  Fan Mail in PtA.  Roll over bonuses in Sorcerer.  The stat consequences in My Life with Master.  I call these things Momentum Mechanics.  Mechanics that measure the impact of the outcome of Conflict A on Conflict B.  A lot of time I see games where conflicts are resolved almost identically mechanically every time.  At the end of the resolution system the fiction has moved forward but the mechanics have not.<br/><br/>As for setting, sure I care about setting.  I consider Setting, Character and Situation to be elements of the created fiction I mention.  But what I care about most (assuming the potential created fiction grabs my attention in the first place) is where the mechanics touch the fiction and how.  How do I as a player move from fiction to mechanics back to fiction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89301/#Comment_89301" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:22:38+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting set of questions. I can, with a little effort, answer them for two of my in-progress games. For my own benefit, and as a data-point, I'll answer them for the closest to playtesting one, ReCoil, now. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?<br/>\n<br/>\nReality! Or more directly, a party which is intentionally or unintentionally impeding the PCs efforts to save Reality, and lives, on a local scale. Intentionally would most likely be the games bogeymen, the Naughtwraiths. Unintentionally, it could be anyone, from well-meaning cops, to mischief-minded gangsters. In the latter case, the question of whether their lives are worth the mission. Also, conflicts have the ability to damage reality, which would be against the PCs assumed goals. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) What mechanical resources do the players have at hand to affect the outcome? How do those mechanical resources manifest in the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Players have their character's skills and supernatural abilities, most of which allow them to determine or alter facts within the fiction. These are largely literal in-game abilities. A player character can create something out of thin air, teleport, many different things. Non-literal abilities can effect undefined sections of the fiction. If it hasn't been determined that a given NPC works at a bar, an information check (or sometimes simply saying so) can allow the player to decide it is so. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) Once a conflict is resolved how is the outcome measured both mechanically and within the fiction?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, for one any facts successfully declared (which is to say most; The declaring player's fact cannot be negated unless they knowingly declare a fact with less strength than an opposing character can match; Facts can be anything from "I knock the gun out of her hand" to "there's a door in the wall; there wasn't one a moment ago", depending on the circumstances) are in effect. I'm not sure if that counts as mechanically, or just within the fiction. Additionally, any 'wraiths destroyed lowers the total active "resistance" to the PCs efforts, and any people killed as a result of PC's conflicts will raise the total active resistance. If Reality is damaged, a Rift (a fictive and mechanical state) may occur, which intensifies the conflicts between the PCs and their enemies, and can create circumstances where more humans may die.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) How does the mechanical answer to 3 feed back into the mechanical answer for 2? How does the fiction impact of 3 feed back into the answer for 1?<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, winning or losing does not really affect the player's ability to affect a conflict or the fiction, unless of course the conflict is actually a PC's "death" conflict. In that case, it can allow it to continue, end it until a new character is made, or reduce it by reducing the character's abilities (the only concept of PC damage). Also, due to the dual nature of the PCs (spirits possessing hosts) any conflict that involves the death of the host will limit the player's contributions until the character can enter another host. <br/>\n<br/>\nFictionally, it is largely situational. A conflict that ends with a PC convincing a cop to join their side will affect future conflicts differently than a conflict ending in that same cop's death. Any conflict that ends by destruction of a Naughtwraith will not necessarily reduce or increase the chances that future conflicts will be with Naughtwraiths, until such time as all active resistance has been destroyed. Any conflicts that damage reality will increase the chances of a Rift, which will increase the likelihood of direct Naughtwraith conflicts, as well as life-saving conflicts. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWow. Those were surprisingly complex to answer. I'm not even sure I've answered them as fully as I could. As for whether there are games where these questions could not be applied, I cannot think of any off the top of my head. Whether any such games would be necessarily flawed is anyone's guess. But I think the questions are definitely useful and interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89303/#Comment_89303" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:27:03+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So for designers and players do these questions interest/resonate with you?

How do I as a player move from fiction to mechanics back to fiction" because it's not assuming a game with lots of resource management and feedback loops. <br/><br/>I sometimes like simple, direct points of contact like the conch shell mechanics you mention, or creative constraint based games that tell player the parameters of what/how to narrate<br/><br/>chance, structure, constraints, resource management can all fool a story into being - sometimes I like games with lots of points of contact, often I like games that use one or two simple systems to generate fiction                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89321/#Comment_89321" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T20:54:35+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  8:54PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are actually great questions for me to look at right now because this is exactly the part of the <a href="http://mikerm.blogspot.com/search/label/Pentasystem" rel="nofollow">Pentasystem</a> that's giving me grief.<br/><br/>1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?<br/><br/>Two-pronged answer here. Going into the conflict, players declare what is "in question" - what attributes of the setting, other characters etc. are going to be changed if they succeed in the conflict - and what is "at risk", that is, which of their own attributes may be modified (positively or negatively) as a result of the conflict, depending on the die results. At the moment I'm not sure whether there are also simple narrative outcomes which can be in question, with no mechanical bits attached; I'm inclined to say that there are.<br/><br/>So, for example: <br/>"What's in question is, does the king let us cross his land?" (narrative)<br/>"What's in question is the king's attribute Hostile to Strangers." (mechanical)<br/>"What's at risk is my Dignified attribute."<br/><br/>2) What mechanical resources do the players have at hand to affect the outcome? How do those mechanical resources manifest in the fiction?<br/><br/>The players control both characters and other aspects of the fiction. (There's no GM. I killed him, took his stuff, and gave it to the players.) But only characters can cause changes to come about, and only characters can enter into conflict, because a conflict is about a clash of character motivations. Character A wants something, character B wants something else; without this precondition there is no conflict. <br/><br/>So the players have, as mechanical resources, several features of their characters. The character's rating in the attribute they're using in the conflict determines how many dice are rolled. The character's rating in the arena of conflict (mental, physical, etc.) determines what numbers on the dice are successes. There are additional mechanics for rerolls and Special Effects, which involve spending currency to have both narrative and mechanical effects beyond the core mechanic. <br/><br/>Rerolls, for example, involve spending either a character currency point and narrating a special use of an advantageous attribute, or a player currency point and narrating a bit of good fortune. This bit is still in flux.<br/><br/>3) Once a conflict is resolved how is the outcome measured both mechanically and within the fiction?<br/><br/>The attributes put at risk get consequences (good and bad) applied to them, which depending on how much the conflict escalated may lead to future rerolls (of failures and successes, respectively) or new attributes. <br/><br/>The attributes put in question can be increased or decreased in power, created or destroyed. This can affect the setting as well as the characters.<br/><br/>In parallel with these mechanical effects go fictional reflections of them, described by the losing player.<br/><br/>4) How does the mechanical answer to 3 feed back into the mechanical answer for 2? How does the fiction impact of 3 feed back into the answer for 1?<br/><br/>Great question. The consequences of the conflict resolution feed right back into the resources available next time, as I've described. (Some of the lower-level consequences, from when you haven't escalated too much, disappear after a while, but the higher-level ones are permanent, at least until you use basically the same mechanics to change them.)<br/><br/>The second part of this question I haven't given as much thought as I should. What's at stake next time because of the outcome last time? What conflicts will now arise because of the way this conflict came out? <br/><br/>Let me get back to you on that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89322/#Comment_89322" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T20:57:21+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  8:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting.

With "When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?", it feels too easy to say "whatever the players are currently in dispute about" for most systems.  I feel like only hyper-focused systems will be able to answer the question in the hyper-focused way you...might be wanting?  (Yeah, as you might tell, I don't know what this question is quite getting at.)<br/><br/>And I feel like maybe at best this question is the micro-view to the macro-view that is "What is your game about?"  I didn't feel like I got a really strong answer from anyone who has answered yet.  No offense to ya'll -- you stepped up, and that's awesome, but let me maybe share my disconnect, so ya'll can explain where you took a turn I didn't.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: alejandro</cite>Success, consequences, how you act, and who narrates are what is at stake. You roll the dice, but you are limited by the values of the dice, so you must decie which one of those 4 items gets which die.</blockquote>\nBut (and to pull a Sorensen or Crane), <em>what's at stake?</em>  You just said that narrating what's at stake is what's at stake.  Thus, I'm rather confused.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Reality! Or more directly, a party which is intentionally or unintentionally impeding the PCs efforts to save Reality, and lives, on a local scale. Intentionally would most likely be the games bogeymen, the Naughtwraiths. Unintentionally, it could be anyone, from well-meaning cops, to mischief-minded gangsters. In the latter case, the question of whether their lives are worth the mission. Also, conflicts have the ability to damage reality, which would be against the PCs assumed goals.</blockquote>\nThis is where I got a feel for the micro-view of "What is your game about?"  Is that the sort of answer you're looking for in your question, Jesse?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Two-pronged answer here. Going into the conflict, players declare what is "in question" - what attributes of the setting, other characters etc. are going to be changed if they succeed in the conflict - and what is "at risk", that is, which of their own attributes may be modified (positively or negatively) as a result of the conflict, depending on the die results. At the moment I'm not sure whether there are also simple narrative outcomes which can be in question, with no mechanical bits attached; I'm inclined to say that there are.<br/><br/>So, for example:<br/>"What's in question is, does the king let us cross his land?" (narrative)<br/>"What's in question is the king's attribute Hostile to Strangers." (mechanical)<br/>"What's at risk is my Dignified attribute."</blockquote>\nYou quickly explained your ideas on a conflict mechanic, not what's at stake.  At least, not from where I'm sitting.<br/><br/>If you take the question as literally as I am, that's a hard (and I suspect rewarding) question.  It's not to be brushed off.  It's not to be answered by talking about mechanics.  "What's at stake during your conflict?"  Look at Dogs in the Vineyard -- what's at stake are things important to the character, either due to her station or to her familiar ties, that create or build up a moral dilemma.  Look at Don't Rest Your Head -- what's at stake is your character's sanity, fatigue, and core elements of what keeps him going.<br/><br/>I still can't answer that for Know Thyself, because it's so damned freeform.  It's like answering that for GURPS or Spirit of the Century.  I can say that conflicts build up momentum towards remembering different things in play, but that's not <em>what's at stake</em>, that's <em>a question my mechanics answer afterwards</em>.<br/><br/>Please explain where I'm off, because I really want to sink my teeth into this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89332/#Comment_89332" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T22:05:51+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 10:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always think the "What's your game about?" question should be asked is in three parts.<br/><br/>1.

It reminds me of when I was talking with a friend about his game, and told him to explain his game over again without using the word "stakes."  Only then did we understand one another.<br/><br/>I'd still like I to hear what Jesse means by the question, because he's received three different types of answers and a fourth person who is unsure how to answer.  When I read "When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?", I think (trying to avoid loaded terms) "When a situation arises that requires or desires mechanical intervention, what elements of the fiction/story/situation are likely to be at the center of that resolution?"<br/><br/>Or, in short, when I see "what are the stakes," I don't think "describe the mechanics."  I think something closer to "tell me what situations provoke conflicts."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89478/#Comment_89478" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T10:12:29+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 10:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>"When a situation arises that requires or desires mechanical intervention, what elements of the fiction/story/situation are likely to be at the center of that resolution?"</blockquote>\nHowever, I think we are running into the same problem as before. My answer to this question is "what they are conflicting over." It seams like I've given the same answer you gave at the beginning.<br/><br/>Perhaps conflict and stakes are loaded, but they are also useful. How long until situation is loaded?<br/><br/>As far as my original answer goes, maybe you are confused by the elements I bring up because they're usually not what is at stake. Sure success is always at stake, but because it depends on the dice alone, however, when its an option between success or consequences or something else it becomes a stake. No?<br/><br/>So, lets take for granted that the characters are going to conflict over some pertinent element within the fiction. It doesn't matter what, only that. So, the subject of a conflict is at "the center of" every resolution. Right?<br/><br/>The question should then be about how it resolves a conflict that exists within the fiction. Perhaps...<br/><br/>"When a conflict/situation arises in the created fiction how is it resolved in a way that supports/reinforces the fiction/theme?"<br/><br/>Jesse: It seems as though what is at "stake" doesn't tell you enough about what is important within the game.<br/><br/>alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89508/#Comment_89508" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T11:13:23+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 11:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Guys,<br/><br/>Wow.  This is all really interesting.  Let me finish clarifying question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> for Alex.  Josh has it right a few posts back.  I'm not saying that after any given conflict the mechanics somehow radically change.  All I'm saying is that there is some mechanical impact after a conflict is over such that over time we can mechanically see the impact of multiple executions of the resolution system.  Fallout in Dogs impacts the characters traits that reflect the conflict that has just been resolved therefore entering the NEXT conflict they have something different about them mechanically than they did in the last conflict.  Overtime that accumulates and the impact is significant.<br/><br/>Even simpler then Fallout in Dogs is Budget/Fan Mail in PtA.  When you spend Budget/Fan Mail in PtA your ability to impact the next conflict is lessened.  So it's rather significant when you spend A LOT of Budget/Fan Mail on a conflict because you're saying "this, right here is so important that I'm willing to risk being totally hosed in whatever the next conflict is."<br/><br/>I'm disappointed by games like, "One Can Have Her."  Where the endgame (appears) to be totally independent of the mechanical momentum of the game.  We play this game over here and then oh at the end everyone just votes.... what?  <br/><br/>Okay, now on to the meatier question of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a><br/><br/>Now I wasn't thinking of question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as mechanical.  Rather I was thinking about it contextualizing the mechanical nature of the follow up questions.  Although, Ryan's phrasing of: "I think something closer to 'tell me what situations provoke conflicts.'" is very appealing to me.<br/><br/>As an example let me try answering the question for my own game Silent Sound.<br/><br/>1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?<br/><br/>In Silent Sound each character has committed a transgression sometime in his past which has gone "unpunished."  The game is structured as a supernatural ordeal in which the characters are confronted with situations that reflect their past transgression.  Will the outcome be the same?  Does this absolve or condemn their past actions?<br/><br/>Now Silent Sound definitely falls in the My Life with Master/Dogs in the Vineyard camp as it has a tight, tight explicit focus.  But I think even a more generic game like Primetime Adventures can answer the question.  It would be something like, "Each character has an issue.  Conflicts arise from the intersection of the characters issues and the situational setup of the rest of the TV show's basic premise."<br/><br/>Does this help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89516/#Comment_89516" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T11:34:05+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 11:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: alejandro</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>"When a situation arises that requires or desires mechanical intervention, what elements of the fiction/story/situation are likely to be at the center of that resolution?"</blockquote>\nHowever, I think we are running into the same problem as before.

Do you choose to succeed or fail, over suffering consequences or not, over acting violently or peacefully, over narrating.<br/><br/>Basically you roll 4 dice (with the option of rolling more, but I'll go into this when I answer Jesse) and you have to decide how you place those dice.

Where the endgame (appears) to be totally independent of the mechanical momentum of the game.  We play this game over here and then oh at the end everyone just votes.... what?</blockquote>\nJesse: So my answer to question 3 is: The potential creation of cues and scars, which are later used to add dice to conflict resolution. When used they then affect narration, which influences the fiction.\n<blockquote>Okay, now on to the meatier question of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a><br/><br/>Now I wasn't thinking of question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as mechanical.  Rather I was thinking about it contextualizing the mechanical nature of the follow up questions.  Although, Ryan's phrasing of: "I think something closer to 'tell me what situations provoke conflicts.'" is very appealing to me.<br/><br/>As an example let me try answering the question for my own game Silent Sound.<br/><br/>1) When a conflict arises in the created fiction what is likely to be at stake?<br/><br/>In Silent Sound each character has committed a transgression sometime in his past which has gone "unpunished."  The game is structured as a supernatural ordeal in which the characters are confronted with situations that reflect their past transgression.  Will the outcome be the same?  Does this absolve or condemn their past actions?<br/><br/>Now Silent Sound definitely falls in the My Life with Master/Dogs in the Vineyard camp as it has a tight, tight explicit focus.  But I think even a more generic game like Primetime Adventures can answer the question.  It would be something like, "Each character has an issue.  Conflicts arise from the intersection of the characters issues and the situational setup of the rest of the TV show's basic premise."<br/><br/>Does this help?</blockquote>\nMuch! <br/><br/>unWritten uses a variation of the hero's journey. In the game the setting player (the temporary GM) pushes conflicts in play based on the HJ. So the stakes are elements on your character sheet, or cues (general group flags,) that the SP has chosen to focus on, the chapters in the HJ indicate the type of conflict to push towards.<br/><br/>Do I kapisch your kaposh?<br/><br/>alex<br/><br/>PS Am I hijacking this thread by focusing so much on unWritten?<br/><br/>PPS I love homemade smoothies!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89559/#Comment_89559" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T13:32:26+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  1:32PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I think my answer to some form of the "what's at stake" question for the Pentasystem is:<br/><br/>Do the main characters get to change the world?

Now I know you said that that is the type of games your looking for. So this question will weed out games you're potentially not interested it. I hope you give unWritten a try anyways...<br/><br/>The conflicts in unWritten are based on the vareous chapters from the hero's journey, so you have 9 different conflict types. But even saying this the stakes for each conflict is really determined by the game you're trying to play, for example, are you going for a game that focuses on melodrama, hunting dragons, or killing melodramatic dragons?<br/><br/>alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89871/#Comment_89871" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T13:53:55+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, "what will provoke a conflict" is an entirely different question from the one I was answering.<br/><br/>And I have kind of a non-answer, which is: When what one character cares about and what another character cares about are incompatible.<br/><br/>So, not a narrowly-focussed game in that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89874/#Comment_89874" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T13:58:16+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought...<br/><br/>When you start out in unWritten everybody fills out a "questionaire" where they describe what is valued by the group and each individual character, as well as what the setting "consists of."

Which I think is a subtle point that is head over heels superior to, "Just whatever comes up in the fiction."<br/><br/>My understanding from (what little) I've read is that unWritten is heavily based on the Hero's Journey which is broken up into very distinct phases with very distinct kinds of situations that represent each phase.  Note: I'm talking about the Hero's Journey as I understand it, not necessarily how your game is structured around it.

However, as in BW/BE, failure is not a block but a branch - and as in HeroQuest, Sorcerer, Donjon etc, success or failure at an action means follow-up actions will receive modifiers.<br/>In the case of a Struggle (i.e. combat, be it physical, mental, social) the stakes are "who gets to decide what happens to your character - you or your opponent".<br/>Additionally, players can put resources at stake in order to win conflicts, so the character may be betting with hir equipment, loved ones, convictions or mental stability.<br/><br/><b>2) What mechanical resources do the players have at hand to affect the outcome? How do those mechanical resources manifest in the fiction.</b><br/>Everything on the character sheet is a resource that can either be used with no chance of ill effects (skills), activated by paying points (traits - actually, receiving negative points, but that's a technicality), or gambled with to increase chance of success (prized equipment, loved ones, etc). Characters can also gain Convictions which will give them bonuses while they hold true; it is the GM's job to try to prove them false. Characters also gain potentially massive bonuses by performing actions in stressful or frightening situations, but this can backfire in the form of mental shutdowns and permanent instabilities.<br/><br/><b>3) Once a conflict is resolved how is the outcome measured both mechanically and within the fiction?</b><br/>A character's sheet will have been altered, often drastically - their Panic points may have increased or decreased, they may have gained Neuroses, they may have gained or lost loved things, their skills may have temporarily or permanently increased or decreased, they may have gained or lost useful equipment, they may have gained or lost Convictions.<br/><br/><b>4) How does the mechanical answer to 3 feed back into the mechanical answer for 2? How does the fiction impact of 3 feed back into the answer for 1?</b><br/>With all the changes to a character's sheet, their ability to participate in future conflicts will have changed, often drastically, sometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently. All changes on the character's sheet reflect directly on the fiction - for example, a Negatrait -2 "Shot in the leg" will mean just that, a Neurosis "Scared of the dark" will mean just that, a lost Prize "Lost: Margie (Sister)" will mean just that.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Hm.

Let me see.<br/><br/>First off, it's a zombie game. Essentially, that means the game is survival horror themed, but the setting is otherwise generic in the sense that you could run a fantasy zombie game, a sci-fi zombie game, a zombie game in modern day Peru, a supernatural zombie game or a "mundane" zombie game like 28 Days/Weeks Later. "Land of the Dead" is both an allegory to "the land after the zombie plague" and a Romero homage - not an actual country or nuthin.<br/><br/>Fear and Love, I believe, are in my answers. Both themes are extremely central to the game. Fear generates higher chance of success for you but can also cause mental complications. See the last sentence in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. Love are the Prizes - items, people or concepts that keep the character fighting the good fight. Prizes are constantly being challenged, both by the GM and by the player. "Loved ones" and "Prized possessions" are mentioned.<br/><br/>However, if I understand your main question correctly, you're asking why if the game is survival, fear and love themed (with a large helping of some undead rotting goodness) is this not reflected in the "Stakes" answer. My answer is, I'm not sure how I could. As I mentioned, the resolution system is rather task-based - DitV/PTA style Stakes are only present in full-fledged Struggles and the stakes are whatever the parties want them to be at the end of the Struggle with negotiation at the end of each "volley". Spirit of the Century does the same thing - if you full-out lose in a conflict, your opponent gets to decide what happens to you. Prior to that, both parties can agree to settle - like, "OK, I get away but I drop the briefcase with the diamonds".<br/><br/>If I answered the question more accurately like "Closing the elevator door before the zombies get there" or "My boyfriend Galen gets away from the horde due to my suppressive machine gun fire", I'm just giving loose examples - far more useful would be to simply splice in a variant of the "What is your game about" question, if that was the answer expected to that question.<br/><br/>Am I just reading this wrong?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90095/#Comment_90095" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T08:54:24+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  8:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael.<br/><br/>Couldn't you say that stakes are likely to be about not getting eaten by zombies?

No, because the system favours inter-PC conflicts as well - and in any good zombie game, the zombie menace is not an active force but rather, in the terms of Til Death, a "Situation". The driving antagonistic force always comes from infighting among the living, PC or NPC.<br/><br/>But yes, as a simplistic response, the Stakes usually consist of variants of "avoid being eaten" is perfectly valid. I just think there's much more to it than that, and that the question doesn't prompt me to properly convey that information.

Why will it matter to me?</blockquote>\nFirst off, in my first response I absolutely diverted from answering the actual question after the first sentence. The mechanics, to me, has nothing to do with the question, that was just me rambling off some stuff I'm excited about / defending the fact that the resolution system is task-based rather than a more <i>in vogue</i> conflict resolution system.<br/><br/>Secondly, to answer your direct questions: You will be spending your time trying to survive. Your character may have driving goals akin to BW's "Beliefs" but these are implicit and require reading between the character sheet lines, usually in the Prizes or Convictions sections. In general, the game simply tries to do good zombie fiction - i.e. the characters are usually reactive, not proactive, and their reactions are usually based around survival of some form. Survival could mean trying to find food, killing zombies, gaining power over others, organizing resistance groups, trying to find a "cure", etc.<br/><br/>Why will it matter to you - do you mean you, the player, or you, the character? If you, the character, survival will be paramount but so will the protection of your Prizes, which you nonetheless have to gamble with to survive. Losing Prizes will make it harder to survive in the long run. I'm trying to build mechanics that consciously rewards those who maintain their sensibilities and do not revert into "combat monster mode" - the game supports uncaring, hardass combat monsters but they tend to meet unfortunate dooms rather quickly. So to your character, your Prizes and sanity will matter, as will your own survival.<br/><br/>As a player, which is what I suspect you're asking, I think it will matter because the players of this game enjoy zombie fiction on a different level than "gore porn". They want to see everyday people (Shaun of the Dead comes to mind) step up to a challenge in the face of true horror, or see a successful alpha male who betrays his loved ones die a horrible death. They want to see people they sympathize with having to make choices between saving their spouse or saving themselves. They want to see heroic sacrifices and horrific betrayals.<br/><br/>How question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> conveys that, I don't really know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
