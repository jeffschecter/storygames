It\u2019s rare that new words in that category are invented. Nouns, like \u201cfish\u201d, \u201cbricks\u201d, \u201cphone\u201d and so on, is an open word class. It\u2019s common that new words in that category are invented.</p>\n<p>Some games take this approach to rules. In 5e, spells are an open rules class. WotC releases new spells occasionally (hopefully that will taper off because not knowing the spells slows down gameplay a lot). Monsters, subclasses, magic items etc are open rules classes as well.</p>\n<p>One of the things that help me keep it together when I think about 5e is to think of the flimsy little rules booklets that came in the LMoP box as the rule book. And to think of the PHB, DMG and MM as expansions. This is why I think 5e <em>did</em> succeed in it\u2019s \u201cmodular\u201d goal. Classes [whoops hello polysemy! character class and rules class aren\u2019t the same thing] are an open rules class. Champion can exist (as it does in Basic D&amp;D 5e) and Battle Master can be added (as it is if you add the PHB).</p>\n<p>This is one of the things that frustrate me with GURPS \u2013 the rules for digging, jumping etc are pretty complicated but they still feel like part of the core rules. Grappling in 3.0, even the simplified CMB grappling in PF, has similar issues.</p>\n<p>Some games seem to me like they are designed with awareness of the separation between open and closed rule classes. Conditions in 4e, and simplified further in 5e, is a big but closed rule class. 5e uses the conditions elegantly to make the rules easier to learn and remember and to adjudicate consistently. The conditions are like a set of tangram pieces that other rules (like some spells) in turn build on. It\u2019s hard to learn them but they are on the screen and on the back of the Starter Set rule booklet. And you <em>can</em> learn them since they\u2019re a closed rules class.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not only about a separation between open classes and closed classes. It\u2019s also a sort of code-and-data separation. Some rules are lists of thing \u2013 like the conditions \u2013 and some are rules for how those things fit together. I.e. D&amp;D has some rules for how advantage and disadvantage works, and then other rules can build on those.</p>\n<p>Uh talk about overthinking\u2026.<br/><br/>but anyway I think that the best and most elegant / easy to learn games take advantage of this. AW has principles, moves and agenda \u2013 and adding or removing moves is NBD as long as you understand the <em>concept</em> of moves.</p>\n<p>A game can be a multipaged tome or a complex interlinked SRD web page as long as the rules <em>themselves</em> are easy. Like how a card game can have simple rules but an infinite number of cards with weird and unique abilities can be added into that game.</p>\n<p>PF and GURPS and even Burning Empires tend to stress me, to scare me. If I was, gun-to-my-head, forced to run PF I\u2019d rely the hell out of that Beginner Box version of the simplified rules for as long as I could. 5e, Fate, PbtA otoh have simple <em>cores</em> that can be added onto. I think one of the first games that did this well was Eeros writeup of Solar System. I was familiar with simple games like Fudge and Everway, and I was familiar with complicated and scary games like GURPS and RQ. Solar System with its simple core (except I never understood the \u201cBringing Down the Pain\u201d stuff, that wasn\u2019t clearly written) and separate crunch section was interesting because it took a different route.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471553/#Comment_471553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T14:04:12+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  2:04PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> Welcome back! <br/>One quick comment: I never thought of Runequest as a game with lots of closed classes/rules. Hmm, I will have to think about that.<br/><br/>One longer comment: your analogy of closed/open class applied to games makes me nostalgic for the old days, when I started playing D&amp;D, around 1977 at the transition from OD&amp;D to AD&amp;D. In those days, the open classes were still relatively empty even in AD&amp;D. Every issue of the Dragon or White Dwarf was like a Christmas present that came 12 months a year. NPC classes? Everyone played those as PC classes. New spells? Awesome! New artifacts? Sure. New Races? Great! Everywhere was undiscovered country! You could pick and choose, because after the core rules (OD&amp;D was just one booklet, really), most of the open class rules were unofficial and optional. I miss the wonder, and surprise, and discovery! It's also probably why I'll never be able to play modern D&amp;D. The open classes are too full and canonical now, and there's no sense of discover/wonder/invention (for me, anyway), or it could just be nostalgia blinding me.  I was going to write about this a couple of days ago, but stopped because I though nobody would get it except the gronards.  <br/><br/>My reminiscing has kind of elided your point, but with the purpose of setting up the following statement: I agree with you to the extreme--I prefer one sheet games now, where all the open classes are left to the GM and players' imaginations.  Extreme, play-to-find-out games are my preference.  One page of rules (closed classes) and one page of oracle lists (open classes) makes me happiest.  So, I guess I like games with a small set of closed classes, and open classes left practically empty. The thought of digesting three or four 100+ page tomes in order to play a RPG makes me groan.  Sixteen pages is my limit.  Maybe, I'm just showing my age.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471554/#Comment_471554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T14:11:42+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  2:11PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In another thread you said, "I value the 'chance to enter a well-defined magic circle'".

I think it's an interesting way of looking at the "Why Do Players Ignore The Rules" question, particularly the thread on rpg.net where so many of responses fell back on the "RPGs are all about doing things your way" excuse as to why you're actually <i>supposed</i> to ignore the rules.<br/><br/>I'm almost certainly treading very old ground for a lot of people here, but Hopeless_Wanderer's grognardly reminiscing reminded me of how I've felt the past few years as I started exploring different types of games from outside The Monoculture; as 2097's framing fruitfully suggests, there's a very big difference between an open class "our fighters are different (because of weapon/armor choice or special powers or whatever)" and a closed class "our fighters are different (because they're meant to fulfill a fundamentally different role than they do in other games)." But if your most important closed class rules operate on a much higher level (for example, at the Social Contract level, "We agree that we are doing this activity for these reasons"), then you might not easily discern the value in closed class rules further down for how they shape play.<br/><br/>I apologize if this actually ended up being a wild tangent or misinterpretation of the intent of the thread, because it sort of felt like that even as I was trying to tie what I was saying back into the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471558/#Comment_471558" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T14:48:00+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  2:48PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> I never thought about the closed/open analogy at different levels of the game.
