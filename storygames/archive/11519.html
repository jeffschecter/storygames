Another part of the genre that is usually overlooked is how mecha transform the character into a warrior-god archetype. My plate is full right now, but I'll probably give it another go sometime.<br/><br/>Along the similar lines, I've taken a try at macho action, but never gotten it to work, and so would love someone else to make it. We're talking about a game that focuses on posturing, witty comebacks and the like, rather than a skill list or better equipment. Every time I've tried my rules have ended up much like Exalted's stunts, which isn't enough guidance, but the approach of "wearing sunglasses +1" doesn't feel right, either.<br/><br/>I'd also love a game that focuses on the move/countermoves of fencing, that interplay of going high and low, shifting footwork, and the like. This one I figure I might be able to do, but it's so far down my priority list that I'll likely never get to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256629/#Comment_256629" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T10:31:37+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 10:31AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>I want a game that does Super Robot anime.

Not really. If you want to use an existing game to do a super robot RPG thing, Bliss Stage would be good for taking on that flavor, but from what I know of the genre it's not about the hero's bonds to other people so much as his own burning passions. Basically, Bliss Stage could do it, but another game (or at least a Bliss Stage hack) could potentially do it far better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256650/#Comment_256650" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T12:28:45+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 12:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still waiting for the Bukowski game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256651/#Comment_256651" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T12:30:46+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 12:30PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s not the game I have a problem with,, It\u2019s the game parts.<br/>\nAdventure,horror,apopilictic creating the game world and the cool things that happen can be done by Gm or by the group.<br/>\nWhat I want is a method of sharing the experience.

The description of the obstacles then translates into how much they'll need to do to get their goal. I can see crossing this with something like <em>How to Host a Dungeon</em>, where you have an initial phase in town researching the dungeon. Each scary tale you hear from the locals adds more dangers to the dungeon, but the more you scale up the danger, the more treasure you can find down there.<br><br>Then you go down and have to clear out all the deadly traps and horrible monsters you heard about--and naturally, some of the sinister surprises that you <em>didn't</em> hear about. If you wanted to take to heart what I said in <a href="http://storyjammers.com/session002/" rel="nofollow">the episode of same podcast before that</a>, you could have two possible outcomes for each encounter: overcoming it, or finding some new, previously unsuspected trap or monster down there. You could do this randomly without falling into the pit of just a mish-mash of nonsense, too. If you're building the dungeon in the first phase in steps\u2014so, first the dwarves dug too greedily and too deep, and then the wizard built his evil tower on top\u2014then you could have the "abandoned dwarfhold" set of random encounters, and the "evil wizard's tower" set of random encounters, and first you've got to work through some number of evil wizard tower encounters before you reach the abandoned dwarfhome encounters.<br><br/>Done right, I think you could have a game as fun as D&amp;D, maybe a whole lot simpler, and certainly requiring a lot less work. And I'd personally love to see a good counterpoint to the argument that a dungeon delve <em>needs</em> a GM.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256668/#Comment_256668" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T16:07:35+00:00" title="February 15, 2010  4:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Gears &amp; Spears: Tribal robot fantasy set in an amazonian jungle in an very distant post-human future.

If one of the cards moves, you fall. Add some rules for difficulty increasing number of cards, and encumbrance meaning you can't use certain fingers or something, and you're set.<br/>Of course, there's the problem that unlike Jenga, there aren't really any cheap knock offs available. If you already had the game though (and I do), it might make for an interesting experiment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256783/#Comment_256783" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T10:23:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 10:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2010 10:24AM by chaldfont.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want a heist/con game inspired by Ocean's 11, Hustle, The Sting, The Great Train Robbery, etc. I want criminal geniuses at the top of their game.

It would be tied together by a website, but orbited by an enormous amount of 'clue' sites.  You play a character that appears to be you in human terms, but can look wildly different to those with the 'sight'.<br><br>It'd have vampires, faeries, death cults, immortals (Highlanders?), men in black, liches, red caps, mummies, vengeful hunters of supernatural baddies, aliens, werewolves, ressurection cults, ghosts, serial killers and supernatural versions of real-life things like gang-bangers, motorcycle gangs, mafia, political cabals, conspiracies, terrorists and so on.<br/><br/>Downtime play would be like some giant veiled version of the Illuminati: New World Order card game, but even wackier.  Online play would be like conspiracy ARGs where you find clue sites and work your way to in-game secrets.  Live Action play would be all about court intrigues and back room dealing.  Humanity would be treated like a resource, but one made out of dynamite.  These groups aren't hiding because they fear humanity, but because they need to shape mankind's ideas and ideals to make the groups the most powerful and controlling.<br/><br/>The central hub website would house password protected forums and blogs for each and every conspiracy; your allegiances would dictate which and how many you could read.

Four or five players is an easily manageable team.  Each game can consist of a "practice" round where the characters set up conflicts between each other, a social round where the characters interact off the ice and try and resolve the conflicts they were put into, and a "match" scene where the team's score is determined by how successful the team was earlier at pulling together and dealing with their problems.  You could do some sort of exestential "bring down the pain" where the person curling is having difficulty letting go of something and the sweepers can either try and help guide the person through it or just try and sweep the problem under the rug.  Probably way to pretentious but it might be a game my wife would enjoy playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260023/#Comment_260023" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T07:32:09+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  7:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Curling is actually a great suggestion, JB.

I bet it could be skinned for more likeable folks though. Closer to "100 Bullets" than "The Sting" in its current form.<br/>Hey I'm down for "Smokin' Aces" action too. I've mentioned elsethread that you can totally use <i>Fiasco</i> for this, right? Because you can! The <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=1977" rel="nofollow">best session I've ever had</a> playing any game was the time we decided to take our <i>Fiasco</i> in this direction. The trick is to be willing to flash forward pretty early in the game, make the flash-forward ambiguous, and give yourself plenty of scenes to resolve the ambiguity in surprising and delightful (for the players... not the characters, usually) ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11519/tell-about-the-game-you-want-someone-else-to-design" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11519/tell-about-the-game-you-want-someone-else-to-design" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11519/tell-about-the-game-you-want-someone-else-to-design/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11519%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11519%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
