I've got Jesse's Play Passionately for Narrativism, Eero's Challenge-Based Adventuring for Gamism, and Kyle Schuant's Cheetoism for beer-and-pretzels play. Does anyone know a good essay/blog/wiki that explains upholds and celebrates Simulationist play in some form? It doesn't have to <i>call</i> itself Simulationism; in fact it's probably better if it doesn't.

The article isn't about GNS/Big Model, and I'm avoiding jargon terms like the plague.

I'm not sure how one gets from the word, "simulation", to "joy of creation and exploration", but that's our joy.<br/><br/>Sadly I don't have an essay for you. An excerpt from the draft introduction to Diaspora, though, reads:\n<blockquote>Diaspora is written deliberately to be a tool kit. We provide a setting, but we encourage you not to use it. We want you to build your own. Instead, we give you a set of axioms about the universe and make some hand-wavey statements about humanity\u2019s place in the universe. And then we give you the tools.<br/><br/>We give you tools to create a cluster of worlds in which to adventure. We give you ways to generate and describe the worlds and their connections as a full-table exercise rather than the more typical GM-only mini-game. We give you tools to describe characters that are organic to the cluster you just created and have intrinsic connections to the characters the other players will create. We give you an arsenal of weapons from which to choose, and, for those inclined, we give you a system to generate more.<br/><br/>We give you transcendant technology and clearly label it scary and dangerous and a sure route to disaster. After all, from the outside, from those cultures that are still struggling with atomic power and orbital lasers, any form of transcendence looks like catastrophe. A hundred billion souls disappear and leave a fragmentary ringworld and a tiny population of ageless, beautiful, and uncommunicative farmers. Or a planet filled with grey goo. The fringe of technology is a nightmare for intrepid heroes.<br/>And intrepid heroes you will be. There is plenty to explore and much about the past that is unexplained. But not only will you explore it, you will decide what you find. It is not our place to write your story: we will stop at giving you some ideas and the tools to proceed into space on your own and find what you will.<br/><br/>You will be the diaspora.</blockquote>\nSorry, no essay, but if it sounds like we're your poster boys, give a shout and maybe there's something here you can use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184764/#Comment_184764" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T23:15:13+00:00" title="December 23, 2008 11:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, sounds like you might be.

It's not a totally coherent source, but here's some of the most fruitful posts (and comments - always read the comments!).<br/><br/>In order of publication:<br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/06/28/bricolage-and-sim/" rel="nofollow">Bricolage and Sim</a><br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/11/17/simulationism/" rel="nofollow">Simulationism</a>. Hrm, reading it back over, I would add a response to Joshua at the end of the comments along these lines: Perhaps the differentiating factor for Sim is that the "direct object" of Exploration cannot be nailed down to a single thing, like it is with Nar (Premise) and Gam (Challenge). Which also accounts for the culture clash between accounts of different Sim-oriented play.<br/><br/><a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2005/12/06/inside-the-simscape-constructive-denial/" rel="nofollow">Inside the Simscape: Constructive Denial</a><br/><br/>Some reference for that whole "bricolage" thing I'm talking about: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14371.0" rel="nofollow">Bricolage APPLIED (finally!)</a>.

Thing is, what I'm really looking for is something, be it webpage or single post, that really embodies the spirit of the thing in a straightforward way. Like, you go to Eero's blog post and it says "Challenge Based Adventuring" and then bam! there's some bold and succinct principles for how to approach that, for player and GM. Or you go to Cheetoism and it says right up at the top, it says "we mostly just game to hang out with friends." And Play Passionately is of course very clear from the get-go on Jesse's philosophy of emotionally vulnerable play.<br/><br/>So I want something like that for "joy of discovery" play. "[Playing] for the sheer joy of building and exploring an imaginary world" is how I phrased it in the essay. So ideally someone reads that phrase and it's all linkified, and they think "hey! That sounds neat," and they click a link that says "this page is all about roleplaying for the joy of building and exploring an imaginary creation" or some such, with a bunch of explanation that the person can read more of if it piques their interest. I'm kinda looking for something that's good to come to "cold," without any knowledge of the subject, or a "that's they way I've always loved to play but I've never seen someone articulate it before!" kinda deal.<br/><br/>I don't wanna make a huge case over this. But I found really great links for the other sample modes and it'd just be silly to post with one left blank.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184813/#Comment_184813" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T10:54:38+00:00" title="December 24, 2008 10:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you see any difficulties in resolving the Build parts with the Explore parts of the style you're talking about?

Those standards can be all over the map: faithful character portrayal, realization of genre tropes, adhering to historical accuracy, working within the literal confines of imagined physics.  It's really no different than the range of possible thematic issues to explore with narrativism or the range of things one could be competing over in gamism.<br/><br/>The problem is that with Narrativism and Gamism Premise and Objective are easily communicated sometimes even through color alone.<br/><br/>However, if I'm a Sim player with very particular ideas about what-is-and-isn't "Noir" then how do I communicate to my fellow players what an acceptable contribution is?  How is the blue-print of shared construction communicated?  That's why sim focused players who want to "really get it right" often have trouble sustaining play over the long run because the conversation breaks down over what "right" is.<br/><br/>I suggest taking a very close look at the Scrip system in Full Light, Full Steam.  In my opinion when it's working correctly it's probably one of the best methods developed for repeated identification, acknowledgment and reinforcement of character portrayal oriented Sim.<br/><br/>That's where design/theory/play work in Sim really needs to focused.

You do thing X which makes me smile and do thing Y in response which makes you grin and do Z.  It takes two to tango.  *Over time* and that "over time" is really fucking key and people tend to miss it: The defining quality of what we're appreciating about each others contributions to the game is Creative Agenda.  We're all here, to do *this* and hey we did *that*!<br/><br/>Individual people don't have Creative Agendas.  They have things they enjoy and things they don't enjoy which get satisfied more or less when a given Creative Agenda is actually in action.  But it takes a group in actual play for a Creative Agenda to be an observable phenomenon.  Which is why GNS and Theory have been folded into Actual Play on The Forge (not "shut down" or "concluded.")<br/><br/>In functional Sim play what we're enjoying is the artifact itself.  This thing we're making looks good according to our pre-play expectations.  And again where Sim really needs work is how you communicate those "expectations" to players so that the guy who thinks he's doing a really bang up job of being "just like Wolverine" doesn't get into a fight with the guy who doesn't think Wolverine could "really have done that."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184864/#Comment_184864" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T17:55:14+00:00" title="December 24, 2008  5:55PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Jesse, either you're completely wrong, or everything I've ever thought I understood about Creative Agenda is completely wrong.

I know that it is what caused much of my own dysfunctional play, because I wanted one thing, and the rest of the group was going for an entirely other thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I understand that an individual's CA may shift from game to game and moment to moment, and I understand that only when the group's collective CA is compatible that functional play can emerge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a matter of fact, I'm not even sure I believe it's possible for a group to have a Creative Agenda... Only the CAs of its individual members. Creative Agenda is what each player is "here to do."

I bet it's a common mistake, thinking that you have to sneak up on stuff like that and then sit around wondering "gee, why is it that we keep having so much trouble communicating these things to each other when we're trying so hard to avoid communication?"  It's like randomly telling them things about your home and and about things that have happened or might happen at 9pm all around the world and how many different things people can eat, and then expecting them to divine the secret message within...without you ever having to say, "You are invited to a party at my house at 9pm, where we will all have punch and pie."

And again where Sim really needs work is how you communicate those "expectations" to players so that the guy who thinks he's doing a really bang up job of being "just like Wolverine" doesn't get into a fight with the guy who doesn't think Wolverine could "really have done that."</blockquote>\nHello all, this is my first post :-)<br/><br/>While, the idea of fixed, narrow and pre-communicated expectations is common in indie games (particularly those of a narrativist or gamist bent), I do not think that it characterises the way that most people play.  Most gamers do not clearly communicate their pre-play expectations and they do not work hard to ensure that everyone is singing from the same thematic hymn sheet.<br/><br/>Any theory of Sim which, as you suggest, is based upon how information about expectations is communicated is working on the assumption that the vast majority of gamers play in a way that is basically identical to the way indie gamers do except that somehow these focusing processes are occluded.<br/><br/>To be honest with you, this simply does not fit with my experience as a gamer.<br/><br/>I consider myself a sim GM and player and I would argue that the lack of clear pre-play expectations, the fluidity of expectations within a game and even within a session, the lack of clear communication of what people want from a game and the frequent failure to address what people want in a game despite them trying to communicate their desires are features of simulationism, not bugs.<br/><br/>From the point of view of Forge and Indie games, most gaming experiences must be unholy messes, but I think that this unholy mess \xa7is not a failure to do sim properly.  It IS sim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185139/#Comment_185139" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T09:09:02+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  9:09AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Do you take pills for that or something?

Sim is The Right To Dream, so I think Sim-lovers get excited about things to dream about<sup>4</sup>.<br/></blockquote>\nYes.  This.  And frankly I've never understood it.  I would love to have someone explain it to me.<br/><br/>I have memories of gamers going on at length about how cool their game about being dinosaur riding spies fighting mecha-driving nazis.  And me seeing their enthusiasm and looking on rather blankly.  I get they were excited about something.  I just don't understand what.<br/>The enthusiasm about imaginary content can come for a variety of reasons, but Ron's "Right to Dream" highlights what that range shares -- the ability to <i>interact strongly</i> with the imagined stuff.<br/><br/>Example: we like fiction involving mecha... we like fiction involving nazis... let's try to <i>create</i> mecha-driving nazi fiction!  <br/><br/>It's that act of creation that's the fun part -- putting your own unique spin on it: "here's how <i>I'd</i> do it!"  Will I do it well?  Will I do it poorly?  Can we really tap this as a fertile source of fun stuff to imagine, or will we burn out on it quickly and move on to dianosaurs and spies?<br/><br/>This is true even for pure emulation.  Let's say you just want to play Ghost Rider.  It'll still be <i>your</i> Ghost Rider, and it might be better or worse than the comic depending on <i>your</i> contributions.<br/><br/>So, when you hear people gush about setting stuff, they're not enthused about "nazis are cool" as much as they're enthused about "nazis are a cool toy for me to create fiction with!"  Maybe your looking on blankly has more to do with dissimliar taste in toys?  I mean, your examples sound awful to me, but I'm sure you can replace them with something neat, like Blade Runner on Mars or Die Hard in a space shuttle or... well, I don't know your taste so I'll stop myself there.<br/><br/>If a group's using a crappy system (game or otherwise) to do Sim, and it intrudes on people's ability to really stretch, emulate, personalize, or otherwise <i>interact strongly</i> with the fiction being created, then Sim sucks.  But when that ability is <i>preserved</i>, then everyone playing has their Right to Dream intact, and it's great.<br/><br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S. I dunno how folks are taking "pre-play standards", but that's only part of the equation.  By your 5th session of a given Sim game, the "standards" may reference the last 4 sessions as much as, or more than, pre-play inputs.  The parameters of "the cool thing we're doing here" are always evolving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185181/#Comment_185181" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T11:21:32+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 11:21AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I'm sure you can replace them with something neat, like Blade Runner on Mars or Die Hard in a space shuttle or... well, I don't know your taste so I'll stop myself there.</blockquote>\nI think this is an interesting quote.

I probably deserve it.<br/><br/>2) The Sim I have enjoyed has always been thematic oriented in the sense of celebration of established theme from a given set of source material.  Similar to Christopher Kubasik's love of Pendragon only my preferences run towards the horror genre and the emotional weight often carried by the pre-planned reveal.<br/><br/>3) It's true that I've never gotten the more kitchen-sink gaming I've seen out there.  Seriously.  I was not being derisive. I've just never understood it.<br/><br/>But Jonathan's post reminds of a play experience I had once.  It was a Changeling game.  It was very much of the school of throw the characters into a situation and let them "be" their characters with very little situation beyond the initial setup.  In this case we were Changeling children who had been turned over to a baby sitter that didn't know our "true" nature.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing, I played a Satyr.  I decided that my character was basically in that awkward stage now refereed to as "tween" where girls are just becoming interesting but has no communication skills.  Layered on top of with the manipulative Pan thing.  So I did stuff like hit-on the baby-sitter in weird ways and tried to be more impressive than the other male characters and stuff like that.<br/><br/>I could tell the GM, indeed the group seemed to have a real hard time with what I was doing.  But here's the thing, I just latched on to what was interesting to me about "child satyr" but clearly I was supposed to be doing something else.  Indeed afterward, the GM singled me out and said to me, "clearly you have no idea how to play a satyr child."<br/><br/>This is opposed to Call of Cthulhu (probably one of the most functional Sim games ever created) where the "supposed to" is obvious.  Investigate the mystery, enjoy the decrease in sanity as your understanding increases, if you're lucky win a Pyrrhic victory over the bad guy.  Trail of Cthulhu is even better at communicating this.  I was in a game shop the other day and just by leafing through it I was able to locate that exact process spelled out neat and clear under the "how this game is played" section.  It was great.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185197/#Comment_185197" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T12:13:14+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 12:13PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>my reading of your Changeling game is that, left to your own devices, you decided to play the game with a focus on interpreting your character (and a rather iconoclastic interpretation at that if the GM is to be believed).  The other people at the table would have had different agendas which could have been solving a problem or just sitting back, cracking jokes and hanging out with some friends.  From my perspective, this is not a disfunctional game... it is a standard sim experience (by which I mean non-nar, non-gam and non-focused).  If you had continued the game then depending upon who was there and who was on form, the balance of play would have shifted.<br/><br/>If there was a failure in that game it lies at the level of the GM expecting you to toe some imaginary line, not in you going "okay, so I'm going to engage with the game in this manner".<br/><br/><br/>Also, on a largely tangential note, I think the pyrrhic victory/existential angst/raging against the dying of the light interpretation of CoC is actually something cooked up by people looking at the game with Lovecraft in mind.  Actual Cthulhu play is more often about investigation and monster killing in a setting with no combat optimalisation, no real power growth and incredibly powerful adversaries.  I've played a number of CoC campaigns where my character survived and effectively 'won'. This vision of the game tends to be the one used by most published material for the game.  It's a sim game with a very well known set of assumptions attached to it, but I don't think there's any actual communication going on.  If anything it's more a matter of people arriving at the table going "oh I'm going to go mad anyway" and playing to that expectation.<br/><br/>Prior to reading Lovecraft or discussing the game with other gamers I played Cthulhu with triumph in mind and it's certainly the attitude I've seen in most of the newbies I've introduced to gaming via the game.  So I would definitely disagree with the idea that there's anything in the game that suggests it's all about gradually getting weaker and weaker against overwhelming odds with death inevitable.  Hell, you can interpret D&amp;D along those lines as no matter how many orcs you kill there are always more out there and no matter how powerful you get, there are always monsters that can kill you and all of your friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185200/#Comment_185200" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T12:30:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 12:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>Actual Cthulhu play is more often about investigation and monster killing in a setting with no combat optimalisation, no real power growth and incredibly powerful adversaries. </blockquote>\nYou're right.

Tastes differ. What I think is really great, others in my group may think is dull and not worth experiencing.  Jesse's GM took something different from the source material than Jesse did, and did not like what Jesse got, and took no steps to resolve what Jesse got with what he expected.

This means that it tends to get out of the way and fade into the background during play.  You're quite right that it allows tone, theme and subject matter to emerge organically during play but I would suggest that there is no pragmatic difference between a system that communicates in such a way as to allow stuff to emerge from play and a system that does not communicate anything at all.<br/><br/>I accept that your interpretation of sim and the centrality of communicating expectations can account for the stuff I am talking about but I think you're watering down your concepts to the point where they cease to actually say very much.  If CoC is text-book sim and people play it without communicating clear expectations before play and the setting does not actually communicate expectations either then I would suggest that communicating expectations is not actually central to sim gaming at all.<br/><br/>Ockham's Razor and all that :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188093/#Comment_188093" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T11:34:51+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 11:34AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CoC does little to nothing to directly emulate its theme and setting, but has a system that doesn't stand in the way of it. I'm beginning to believe that it's more important for a sim game to avoid inhibiting emulation than to directly facilitate it\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>While, the idea of fixed, narrow and pre-communicated expectations is common in indie games (particularly those of a narrativist or gamist bent), I do not think that it characterises the way that most people play.  Most gamers do not clearly communicate their pre-play expectations and they do not work hard to ensure that everyone is singing from the same thematic hymn sheet.<br/><br/>Any theory of Sim which, as you suggest, is based upon how information about expectations is communicated is working on the assumption that the vast majority of gamers play in a way that is basically identical to the way indie gamers do except that somehow these focusing processes are occluded.<br/><br/>To be honest with you, this simply does not fit with my experience as a gamer.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't fit with my experience either. Which is bad, because keeping everyone's expectations in sync, at least to the point that the outcomes of their character's actions make <i>sense</i>, could very well be the most important thing done in an RPG.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>I consider myself a sim GM and player and I would argue that the lack of clear pre-play expectations, the fluidity of expectations within a game and even within a session, the lack of clear communication of what people want from a game and the frequent failure to address what people want in a game despite them trying to communicate their desires are features of simulationism, not bugs.</blockquote>\n...Annnnnnnd you've lost me.<br/><br/>Inconsistent expectations destroy all games, regardless of agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188112/#Comment_188112" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T12:26:54+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 12:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anon.adderlan</cite>CoC does little to nothing to directly emulate its theme and setting, but has a system that doesn't stand in the way of it.

One person looks at Lovecraft and sees a whole extradimensional cosmology, another sees lonely horror tales about sanity-twisting dark arts, and a third sees ancient civilizations seeking revenge.  Some see hopeless narrators pursued to their inevitable and inescapable demise, others see hideous monsters being revealed and subsequently tommy-gunned by the troops.  What sort of system could possible facilitate all of those disparate interpretations?<br/><br/>But an aggressively vanilla system, one that fades into the background...well, at least with that, any group that can reach some kind of consensus on its own can have a fun time playing whatever their version of Lovecraftian horror is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

expectations destroy all games, regardless of agenda.<br/>I won't pretend I know exactly what Johnatan had in mind but I think I played quite a few times in this mode. I have a comparison which might be relevant. <br/><br/>When I was in lycee (i.e. high school) our French teachers were following the official program. More often than not it involved analyzing deeper and deeper the style, place in litterature, biographies of various authors. And I understood the pedagogical intent : make student aware of what compose texts, what are the intentions, how poetry proceeds, how to obscure non-conformist ideas to censorship and many other interesting topics. And analyzing the text and authors life was a necessary step for all this. But I didn't enjoy the books we read then. It was like this attention to details, this expectation of analysis was making my fun look like a seagull covered with tar trying to enjoy the breeze. Later I read some of the authors I cringed at reading in school and it was nice. Sometimes it even transformed into a passionate reading experience.

I was being lazy and WAY too lyrical.<br/><br/>When I'm playing, heavy math takes me out of the 'zone', as does knowing the precise probabilities for an outcome (as that sort of thing is just unknowable in the real world). OOC banter doesn't, rolling dice doesn't, spending FATE points to change the scene through player action instead of character action doesn't, and a mismatch between player knowledge and character knowledge doesn't. Yet I know at least one person for each of these that's taken out of the 'zone' when they occur.<br/><br/>You know how simply being aware that you are writing a scene as opposed to experiencing an event can change how the moment feels. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>It's really hard to put these largely internal elements into concrete terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188661/#Comment_188661" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T11:05:12+00:00" title="January 16, 2009 11:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've got an opinion on that, and it's not generally a popular one, but I'll say it anyways.  You don't have to agree with me on it.<br/><br/>Now, I know that certain things will take people "out of the zone," or "break their immersion," or whatever.  And I know that these things vary from person to person.  Really what it is, is that the thing that "broke their immersion" took up too much processing power, so to speak, for the person to do that thing and maintain the "zone" at the same time.<br/><br/>But I think this is a matter of skill.

It's like when you're learning a language and you suddenly discover you're not consciously thinking about it when you speak it anymore.<br/><br/>And a set of RPG rules is rather like a non-verbal language one learns to speak, as it is used to communicate with other players. I think this is one of the things that sets RPGs apart from other games which just rely on following rules. In these games, players interact with the rules, and probably interact with other players outside the rules, but they don't interact with other players <i>through</i> the rules. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I guess the simplest way to put it is that communication driven games <i>require</i> other players, while rule driven games don't.

What appears to occur to me is that individuals may well realize they are trying to manipulate the movement of the indicator early on, but also realize that they can't come right out and do so, or it would be terribly obvious and ruin the ouija session.<br/><br/>Instead, the subtley pull/push, and accept if the indicator goes somewhere. Collectively, the group will begin, without verbally negotiating with one another, to piece together an emergent pattern, from the way the indicator moves. Play goes faster as obvious words begin to emerge into some sort of coherent message. Said message becomes more clear ( pattern recognition) as individual players shout out questions.<br/><br/>So, yes, basically Ouija Board play is a sort of on-the-fly creation process of the "entity" being "contacted".<br/><br/>Hell, maybe Ouija counts as a Story-Game :-D !!<br/><br/>The negative use of "ouija board gaming" would be more akin to a _bad_ ouija session, where players keep pulling in all directions, and nothing but gobbledigook emerges because of that, yet all of the players have heard that Ouija Boards are awesome and spooky, so they just keep playing but all gobbledigook all the time.<br/><br/>And then they do it next week. And the week after. For ages. On the hope that one day that really cool experience they've heard about would emerge.<br/><br/>Of course, a player could simply take the lead ( communicate) something and try to set the tone a bit:<br/><br/>"Let's call up a fallen angel! Mwahahahahahahahaaaaaa!" or something equally creepy.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Anyway, the trick is that, for at least a portion of the gaming hobby population, there had been a sort've, mmm, cultural "ban" on discussing metagame stuff. Even stuff like : "Hey! I'd like more [x] and less [y] in the game"<br/><br/>Which, if the players in question had absorbed that "ban" as the norm, really only left "Ouija Board"-style subtle manipulation as a tool.<br/><br/>And some people were (and are) <b>very</b> good at it, the way a buddy of mine was very good at "running" very memorable ouija board sessions.<br/><br/>It's just that it didn't work for everyone, and so other methods were looked at for communicating what the players actual want in a game. And that meant stripping away the "ban" and talking more openly about stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188749/#Comment_188749" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T19:29:03+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  7:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anon.adderlan</cite>I am thoroughly convinced that you cannot design<i>for</i>immersion or verisimilitude.

Bear with me; it's been a long week.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure metagame cooperation is all-important to successful immersion. Assuming we're talking about the same kind of metagame cooperation. I think it probably has to happen in a formalized, cordoned-off kind of way. Like, at the beginning of a session, we all agree (authorially and out-of-character), about certain facts and facets of play. I don't know what those would be, if you were to build a formal "technique" around that. But it seems like formally cordoning off the "now I am speaking as a player" time would mean that all the rest of the play time could be spent in-character, being present in the imaginary moment.<br/><br/>Probably, to form a formal technique, we need to address specific points of disagreement or confusion or, maybe, more positive stuff we agree we want to address.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about this Fading Suns game I ran many years ago. The goal was extremely high immersion, one of those hardcore "everything that comes out of your mouth from this moment on is in character, period, full stop" type sessions. We all agreed this is what we wanted to do. It was also a highly confrontational game (as the FS backstory was so good at setting up, what with warring noble houses and all that other Dune-y goodness). So to deal with the confrontational nature of the game, and to serve our hardcore IC-no-matter-what play style, we'd have an OOC period at the front of each session. As GM I'd recap the current state of events. Then the players would talk a bit about what they thought they'd be doing during the sesh -- and then start riffing on what would be totally awesome to see get played out. As GM, I'd sit there and listen to the riffing because that's where the good stuff came from. I'm not sure the players really connected the cause-and-effect of them riffing on "totally badass scenes," me stealing the scene ideas and engineering them into the flow of events, and the players having the scene ideas fed back to them. I think that, if they were highly conscious of that process, the urge to game the process (i.e. suggest scenes that benefitted their particular agenda, rather than what would be totally badass to see) would ruin it for everyone.<br/><br/>The thing is, the process gave us a clear marker, a moment beyond which everyone was now required to remain IC. Metagame shit took place, now it's done, and now we're sticking to our characters' POVs. I think that clear marker, that ritual, was useful.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188767/#Comment_188767" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T21:19:07+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  9:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>Did you take any break periods for other OOC times in the middle of a session?<br/><br/>I played in a LARP a few months back that had scheduled breaks of a bout 10-15 minutes where a little record-keeping/plot updating stuff was done, and ended having something an experience much more like character immersion than usual.

It's getting hazy. I might wrap this up with a shot of Sailor Jerry's spiced rum. Chilled spiced pear vodka sounds totally awesome right now, but vodka and I have a...complicated relationship.<br/><br/>No breaks for OOC...at least not formal, now-we-are-OOC breaks. But of course we had to be OOC every time we engaged the system. I don't think there is a way to engage any mechanic or formal procedure and remain in-character. The character isn't rolling dice, right? <i>It has to be the player</i>. So, yeah, there were these long bits of being OOC but they didn't seem disruptive to the OOC experience. I think it's because the formal marker wasn't there. It's like everyone just parked their IC-conscious minds for a bit, rolled the dice and did some quick calculations, and unparked their IC experience while I picked up with whatever the die result was and merged it into my narration.<br/><br/>The scheduled breaks are interesting. I wonder if that'd be useful (i.e. stay IC because you know you've got a break coming up) or disruptive (now I have to kill some time and pretend I'm Mylar The Elf because our next OOC break isn't for another six minutes...)?

I think that's an important one to me personally, though. Not sure how that would be workable in practice.<br/><br/>As for engaging mechanics, one of the things I'd considered was the use of some very simple color coded dice, with a known ranking from really hard to really easy. No real calculations involved. The GM would simply push a die forward at a time when a die roll was required, and the player could simply glance at it and get an idea of how risky their chances of success were.<br/>They could then accept and roll the die, with success being achieved by a marked side coming up ( failure on a blank side).<br/><br/>They could also refuse the roll, and try other stuff (still in-character, and the GM could then withdraw and cahnge the die being used.<br/><br/>Not perfect, and still involves a roll, but very minimalist, and perhaps <i>less</i> immersion breaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188779/#Comment_188779" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T22:25:16+00:00" title="January 16, 2009 10:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game Delve uses explicit signals to separate "in game" from "out".  "Up for Air" means the game is paused for everyone; no one has any confusion about trying to do stuff in-character until "Dive Back In" is called.  It seems effective in partitioning off the "non-immersion time".  This is something plenty of groups do informally, so I dunno how many folks this would help.  More than zero, though.<br/><br/>KBob, here's a mechanic you might like: <br/>PIE is a system where (like your colored die example) difficulties are made explicit, the target number for success is known, multiple colored dice are rolled, and the player narrates outcome based on (a) overall success and (b) value of each colored die.  Each die color represents a different source of color in explaining the resolution -- your own effort, your enemy's, and the surrounding environment.  So, a successful overall roll with low value on "me" and high on "enemy" might mean you screw up but your foe walks into your backstroke.<br/><br/>I love PIE's quantity of color.  Alas, knowing difficulty via metagame signals rather than in-character encounter runs opposite to the style of immersion I like best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188796/#Comment_188796" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-17T06:58:46+00:00" title="January 17, 2009  6:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really don't think sim is about immersion.<br/><br/>If sim is about engaging with a setting then I don't think you need to be 'immersed' in said setting in order to make the most of it.
