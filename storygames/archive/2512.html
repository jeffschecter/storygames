Enough that I'd be embarrassed to count up, and that it might be a futile exercise anyway.  The individual games have disintegrated into a sort of rough hummus of accumulated experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I took a break from it, and coming back I <i>notice things</i>.  The very first thing I notice is that the game system says "You have the freedom to create any character, from anywhere, ever!  Make the world from which he comes, and all of his supporting NPCs.  The power is finally in your hands."<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, I find that unhelpful.  And, from the evidence of people I've played with, <i>they</i> find it unhelpful too.  They immediately latch on to the few things that <b>are</b> rigidly defined in the setting, and build from there.  Who is your character's parent?  Which of the elder Amberites do they know, and what are their relationships with them?  Where do they stand relative to Amber, the Pattern, the Courts of Chaos, and so on?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow ... <b>potentially</b> ... the freedom to create anything includes the freedom to create rigid anchor points that the other players can latch on to, as starting points for their own characters.  But in practice, I find that people look to the GM to do that, no matter how much the GM asks them to do it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way to sell this?  Could you, for instance, <b>limit</b> people's right to define those anchors, so that they value the opportunity and therefore sieze it?  If you say "Each of you may define <b>one</b> setting element that will be important to everyone ... anything else that you define from there on in will only be as important to other people as they choose to make it in play," will that be a spur to creativity, or will it just add <i>performance pressure</i> to the blank page syndrome?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I become one contributor among many, rather than a herder of cats?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arref" title="Arref"><img alt="Arref" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nX3VMQSRREUB5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arref">Arref</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58057/#Comment_58057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-25T13:19:20+00:00" title="February 25, 2007  1:19PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, your suggestion sounds pretty good.

Everything from Dogs int he Vineyard to Unknown Armis to anything with a freeform component.  I bring out a game, say Dogs, and say "Hey, take any ability you want!" And the players will sort of look at me with a blank stare. Eventually, just like I see happen at Con games and the like, the GM will say, "Yeah, you can take anything you want. Here's some examples" (and they'll rattle off a number of examples from characters from the book, characters they've seen, etc).  Eventually the players have an idea of the boundaries or just a feel for what else has come before, and start to play within those boundaries.<br><br>A game that really gets this right is Spirit of the Century for Aspects: There's a page with a laundry-list of nothing but dozens of Aspects: Not for the players to pick from (though some will), but to show the range and depth of what can be used.  Many players use aspects found on that list as an inspiration to create their own.<br><br>So, that's all rules-based "Tyranny of Freedom". What it looks like in Amber we have the same thing, but for Setting. Saying "You can come from anywhere you want and have any kind of NPC followers you desire" is like SOTC's Aspects, but without examples.  Creating them takes a long time, often accompanied by doubt and some stress.<br><br>The best thing that could have been done to remedy that would to have provided three extra pages of examples, one actual play example per page, of an example player creating their world and NPCs (each of the three players creating a very different kind of shadow), to show how it's done and provide some inspiration to the reader.  Perhaps another page which shows about a dozen one-sentence examples of Shaodws, a dozen relationships, a dozen different NPCs, a dozen different flavor elements.<br/><br/>Basically, yeah, I've experienced the same thing all the time with my players. I've been in that position as well, where I'm not sure what I should be thinking of.  The solution to this is always, Always, ALWAYS more examples, more sample text. Many designers don't use examples because they figure 1) Their players are smart enough to come up with X on their own, and 2) They don't want to "put limits" on the creativity of the players.<br/><br/>...after that, you can try making up fun stuff like "Tools to use to create a Shadow", or "roll or choose from this chart of NPCs and relationships", or something like the World Burner from Burning Empires, but the first, easiest, and most often ignored step is examples, lots of examples.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pfstrack" title="pfstrack"><img alt="pfstrack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pfstrack">pfstrack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58095/#Comment_58095" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-25T23:53:17+00:00" title="February 25, 2007 11:53PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't give your players absolute freedom.

I don't mean just to the Amberites themselves, to the <i>players</i>. I think you've nailed this already in your PbP - the whole purpose of the Shadows is to act as a mirror (or a key) to the personalities of the Amberites themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing back to your OP:<br/>\n<br/>\n"God, I find that unhelpful. And, from the evidence of people I've played with, they find it unhelpful too. They immediately latch on to the few things that are rigidly defined in the setting, and build from there. Who is your character's parent? Which of the elder Amberites do they know, and what are their relationships with them? Where do they stand relative to Amber, the Pattern, the Courts of Chaos, and so on?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this as a <i>good</i> thing. I'm playing in a game that outpowers Exalted - I can stunt an entire fucking <i>planet</i> - and more! - if I need to, and no one is going to blink at it. (Oh yeah, thanks for that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that the main positioning (mechanical and story) is going to be around the characters and their relationships, and where their interests collide. I think this is why the anchors have to involve people instead of places.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if the issue is that people aren't able or willing to stunt those planets or explore the shadows in detail, that's more interesting.

One of the disconnects we had was between the novels and the game:  In the novels, Shadows are scary, unknown and kind of important.  Avalon is a big deal, so is whatever place the Fount of Power is, our own Earth matters a lot, and so on.  In the game ... not so much.  When we sat down to plan our 3rd season (Senior year) of gaming one of the common goals was to give Shadow more respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did this by basically acknowledging what Jonathan Tweet later called the rule of Drama -- that Shadows would have stability, weight and power in play in direct proportion to how much <i>we the players</i> knew about them.  I don't think that at the time we boiled it down to quite so clear a formulation, but that was basically how we addressed the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which brings me to say:  I think part of the "blank canvas/too limited" discussion above exists in the context that, yes, you can define all these cool shadows and widgets and so on <i>but in a lot of Amber games the stuff you make has all the resilience of tissue paper</i>.  So people tend to focus on Amber, Chaos, devious relatives and objects of power because those are the only things deemed "real" enough to have any staying power, and therefore the only things worth putting creative energy into developing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my biggest advice would be to talk with players about how "real"/"important" you want Shadow to be.  Then I would allow each player to propose one Shadow which is going to be important to the game.  Brainstorm the shadows and flesh them out a bit.  I'd do this even before doing chargen.  You could even take a leaf out of Shock: and assign a different player to be the "content boss" for each Shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust coming up with N shadows before play starts seems like it will go a long way towards colouring your game for you.  Suddenly you don't have infinite tepid worlds to play in.  You have (N + 2) (the +2 being Amber and the Courts, natch) worlds, each of which has a distinct character and flavour to it.  PCs can then definte themselves in relation to these "core" worlds, either as residents or as outsiders who've never been near any of them.  Even the outsiders will actually have something to be outside of -- which is helpful in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.

Thank you Robert.  Good post.<br><br>Speaking to your example, Tony, there's no handy way to distinguish between "Binky the pet dragon" (i.e., color) and "the Draconic Empire" (thematic, plot-driving stuff) with the tools the Amber DRPG gives you.  You either need to have a separate mechanism worked out, like questionnaires, or, as I was saying, you need a well-trained group of storygamers who will cleverly take each other's creations and build on them to create meaning.  Either way, there's some kind of underlying structure that helps us make distinctions.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58364/#Comment_58364" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T13:26:42+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  1:26PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danny:  There isn't a way to <b>flag</b> such a piece of fiction, but I think you can absolutely tell the difference between Binky and the Empire of Scales, in any gaming system, once play commences.  The difference is "Do players (other than the player who created it) orient their characters relative to this piece of fiction?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf <b>everybody</b> has an opinion on Binky, and their opinions are meat for discussion and controversy then, as unlikely as it seems, Binky is a formative restriction of the game.  Contrariwise, if nobody but the person who created the Empire of Scales plays their character with any opinion of the draconic warlords then it isn't structuring the game for the rest of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsent the ability to flag the fiction (saying "Hey guys, Binky's supposed to be color, so don't orient around him ... the Empire is supposed to be a big deal, orient around that instead"), the players don't have much control over which of their creations land in one category, and which land in another.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich may mean that my original question (way up-thread) is cracked:  Maybe the question is the (easier) one of saying "How do you encourage players to view the things that other people contribute as <b>obligating</b> them to respond?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58367/#Comment_58367" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T13:35:32+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  1:35PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reward them for doing so.<br><br>Social: "Hey!

For example, if I write "...Binky the Wonder Dragon..." I'm not flagging it. But if I write "..<i>Binky The Wonder Dragon</i>" then it's a polite request to respond to him. If I write "...<b>Binky the Wonder Dragon</b>..." then I'm also saying "hey look at Binky, he's really important!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn't 100% obligate people to respond, nor does it exclude them from responding to other elements (which they could emphasise in their post) but it's a simple way of drawing attention to an element without adding OOC chat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58552/#Comment_58552" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T14:42:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  2:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm ... just using the styles of text?

We boiled that down to mostly being around Arden, and mostly being that the shadows are radically changing.  And, once that was on the table, I immediately got more interested in figuring out my particular take on <i>Julian</i>, the NPC most specifically associated with Arden.  I haven't figured out where he stands relative to these changes, but <i>every single idea</i> I have for him is more interesting than any idea I had before the constraint was given to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
