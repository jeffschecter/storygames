                    So, over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=120&amp;page=1#Item_24" rel="nofollow">[TSoY] Wings of Shadow Climax</a>, I posted a bit about how I didn't think the GM had done anything wrong.<br/><br/>To summarize what he did:<br/><br/>The GM told them their entire TSOY campaign had been a VR simulation gone bad in a Shadowrun game. He even handed them Shadowrun characters based on their TSOY characters. He thought it was a trippyfun thing to do, and at least one other player thought it was the cool shiznit, too. The rest of the players were all WTF and got pissed. <br/><br/>My wife Steph and I talked about this, and my initial reaction was WTF, too, and Steph beat it into me that the GM did nothing wrong. <br/><br/>Certainly, when players disagree about something in the fiction, System steps in, right? Lumpley Principle. System is how players agree on changes to the fiction. Or "shared imaginary space" or "SIS," if you don't like "fiction." The problem here, as I see it, is that this was not only a change to the fiction but also a change to the System. <br/><br/>Should the Lumpley Principle say: "System is how players agree on changes to the System"? Gah, I hope not. Circular definitions aren't terribly useful.<br/><br/>If LP doesn't contain changes to System, what does? Is that just Social Construct outside of rules? What if you write rules that tell you how to modify the rules? Is that part of System (subject to LP) or not?                </div>

Its just lame.  It is the GM invalidating their entire gaming experience up to that point.<br/>
<br/>
It was lame in Dallas and its certainly lame at the table.                        </div>

                            Whether the GM was "wrong" or "right" has nothing to do with System.  System is what <em>happens</em>, not what is <em>supposed to happen</em>.<br/><br/>So, LP-System-wise, the GM dictated that he was making massive changes to the game.  In the absence of any formal means of discussing the matter, the players did not stand up and walk away from the table, and so the gigantic change was ratified.  Further, by saying "we are no longer playing according to TSOY rules" the GM removed any and all authority tools that the players may have had access to under the old system -- what intrigues me is that it was assumed that the GM retained his authority.<br/><br/>Whether or not the GM did something "wrong" is entirely up to the social contract -- the mores of a specific group are idiosyncratic to that group -- and it <em>sounds</em> like that wasn't very developed in this situation.                        </div>

                            I did a very similar thing to a group many years ago. However, I think the importance here was that the players were aware there was something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the Kult game I was running was, in effect, the security system for a program they were trying to crack in a cyberpunk game of my own invention. Above and beyond the strangeness of a normal Kult game, there was an awareness that some was indeed not right with the situation: recurring experiences, identical people, 'blips' in reality (pre-Matrix days as well). There was an expectation that the game would 'change' at some point and the players were expecting this.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it all comes down to 'permission'. If the GM does not have the permission of the players to seriously alter the very game they are playing, then that is, in my mind, bad for the shared experience they are trying to create. In my case, I would argue that was: 1) expectation from the players that changes would take place and 2) permission from the players to allow these changes.<br/>
<br/>
It's not the kind of game I would run now, as it's way too much the "you woke up and it was all a dream" kind of thing. However, in the context of this discussion, I think the important difference is permission.<br/>
<br/>

<p><code>What intrigues me is that it was assumed that the GM retained his authority.</code></p>
<p>You and me both, Joshua.  My reaction to being told "We're no longer playing TSOY" would be "Cool then!  How about a Soul Calibur tournament!"  If I was told "No, dude, we're playing Shadowrun because I'm the game-master and I said so," I'd point out that the guy isn't game-master of my <em>life</em>.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly.  Using GM position to fiat "We're all going to engage in another activity now"?  Man, if I could do that then we'd end up playing "Everyone gives Tony their money" a lot more.  It's a cool new game, with a radical approach to player interaction, and I've been wanting to give it a try!</p>

                            The GM did do something that was, if not wrong, horribly misguided. He pulled a bait and switch at the highest level of System. Sure, one player was cool with it, but what if the GM had switched over to FATAL or had sewn sock puppets of all the characters and transformed the game into free-form sock puppet theater?<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the GM seems to have assumed that his in-game powers translated into his social contract powers as well. Maybe he wasn't even aware that his change of game fell into one realm and not the other. Either way, it was a serious faux pas.<br/>

                            Is it just me, or does the sock-puppet thing sound cool?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I don't think that trying out such surprises is misguided -- as long as there is the understanding that the players can and will call you on it if that's not what they want.  For example, in one session of our Buffy game we introduced a new mechanic using tarot cards.  In another, the GM shuffled around all of our character sheets when our spirits were mixed up by a spell.  <br/>
<br/>
But, like everything in the game, it depends on player buy-in.  If the players are cool with it, then I'll bet it could be a real blast to suddenly go around with sock puppets of your characters.                        </div>

<i>What intrigues me is that it was assumed that the GM retained his authority.</i><br/><br/>Welcome to the damage...  you learn to swallow your words and fall back on GM authority because it's "how it's done".  You're in shock, you fall back, and the folks who are not in shock lead you by the hand and (because play hasn't stopped for you to get your bearings), suddenly you found yourself playing a different game.<br/><br/>System is what happens, regardless of how healthy or happy the individual members  are with it.  If System happens by people applying brutal social pressure, that's how it happens.  What was busted was Social Contract.                        </div>

                            Remember that at least one player other than the GM thought this was a cool thing. There was pretty clearly nothing implicitly in place to prevent it. It wasn't way out of bounds.<br/>
<br/>
I want to focus this thread on LP and System though and not hijack the interesting talk about freaky Dallas plotlines from the originator thread.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen a definition of System that says it's "what happens." Every definition and formulation I've seen says it's "how it happens." Ephemera is "what happens."<br/>
<br/>
I think, pretty clearly, our definition of System has to allow for metadiscussion and I'm curious how to resolve the tangled hierarchies that result.                        </div>

                            As a concrete example of a game that has these sort of interactions built-in, what about Universalis? It's been a while since I read the book, but I can't recall anything that would prevent someone proposing something like "From this point on, we play by the rules of X game instead of Universalis" as a rules gimmick. Of course, unless you have enough coins to overpower everybody else at the table, you may well be mechanically shouted down, but the possibility is there.                        </div>

                            I've seen major plot-changes of that style happen in games before and be fun and functional. Usually we set them up before hand with the "I've got a strange idea." A lot of this has to do with trust that the GM's vision will be a good one (and, similarily, that a player's idea will be a good one if the player is doing stuff that seems highly unusual and says "bear with me on this.")<br/>
<br/>
Without that, yeah--it's a bait and switch instead of a surprise party.<br/>
<br/>
And I second the "Gimme all your money game." Tony may have copyrighted it but I'm sure some hacked pdfs of the rules are available on Kaaza (i.e. this is in no way a violation of the LP, it's just the dude gettin' away with something that you coulda said 'no' to).<br/>
<br/>
I will also note that in multi-player tradtional gaming the GM is often essentially the owner of the game in a sense that the loss of a player is in many cases I have seen less catastrophic to the game than the loss of the GM.<br/>

<i>"system is all the ways, in play, we come to concensus about what happens in the shared fiction, and what procedures we'll use to help us arrive at concensus."</i><br/>
<br/>
What, then, isn't system?<br/>
<br/>
If, during the course of play, the following occurs:<br/>
<br/>
Player 1: "I think we should stay in the keep on the borderlands, here, and make it our sallying point to protect the North Killdarn Highlands."<br/>
<br/>
Player 2: "Sounds like a good idea."<br/>
<br/>
Player 3: "That'd mean giving up the search for my lost father - if we stay here in North Killdarn, I'm going to lose the trail."<br/>
<br/>
Player 1: "Forgot about that ... "<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Jim, you weren't satisfied with your character anyways ... why not let Bofur go off in search of his father in the background, and you can roll up a new character to join the group.  Later on, we can figure out what happened to Bofur and you can take him up again if you want."<br/>
<br/>
Player 3: "Oh, ok.  Hey, I'll be a gnomish engineer who comes to work on the keep and gets caught up in adventuring ..."<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
At no point were the rules of the game referenced - the conflict between players was solved outside of any formal 'system' of resolution.  Unless you're willing to go so far as to say that all player consensus is system ... but then you're dealing with a definition of 'system' that isn't, well, systemic.<br/>
<br/>
The OED says <i>A set or assemblage of things connected, associated, or interdependent, so as to form a complex unity; a whole composed of parts <b>in orderly arrangement according to some scheme or plan</b>; rarely applied to a simple or small assemblage of things (nearly = Ã¢â‚¬ËœgroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœsetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢).</i>  I think if you were to formalize the process ("If the characters' paths diverge, the minority share of the characters is put in retirement."), then it's system.  If it's ad hoc, then its just social negotiation.                        </div>

                            I'll have to review some things, but I believe that in the strictest theorectical sense (at least according to Forge theory which the LP is apart of), mechanics don't constitute system per se, they represent authorities.

Actually Kuma, according to the Lumpley Principle---which the original poster asked about---all player consensus *IS* system. So for the purposes of this thread, that's the definition we're using. If you don't agree with the Forge definition of system, that's cool, not everyone does, but that's what we're talking about here.                        </div>

I understand the Lumpley Principle - but I don't think that you can call a random collection of group agreements a 'system'.  I'm not arguing that you can't have a consensus-building tools that an individual group abides by.  I'm arguing that these tools aren't part of a system unless they're, at the very least, <i>coherent</i> or <i>consistent</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise the Lumpley Principle is simply an ad-hocracy.  Which is fine, again, but it beggars the use of the term 'system'.                        </div>

                            For what little it's worth, I use "rules" to talk about principled consensus. The system is the process whatever it is, ad-hoc or whatever; it's rules when it's not ad-hoc.<br>

So I recognize the distinction you're drawing, and I figure we can use whatever terms to talk about it we agree to.<br>

Well, where does System end then?  If we go by what you're saying - 'the rules in people's heads' - then a player's entire social schema is part of System.

Not knowing <i>Burning Wheel</i>, and I could kick myself for not owning it yet, I don't know what the rules are for the Duel of Wits - but I have a really hard time imagining that it couldn't be translated in some fashion into <i>D&amp;D</i> terms.<br><br>That aside - the reason that they occupy the same space is that they wind up occupying <i>all</i> of the space.  What I think this does it discourage the creation of rulesets that incorporate these other methods that are part of 'System'.  I see it as an easy out for designers to say 'Well, the people playing this will know about consensus-building, so there's no need to put this mechanic in the <i>rules</i>', or to incorporate '... the players then decide among themselves ...' in the rules as if that were an actual game mechanic.  <br><br>Sure, that'll get the job done, but first of all it leaves those groups out in the cold who maybe need a crutch for consensus-building at first - assuming that the point is to help groups who aren't already masters of the form; and secondly I feel that it divvies up the responsibility unequally between the designer and the players.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

It does - but at the same time I think that there's a lot of design opportunities that go by the wayside if you just handwave the problem as 'let the players figure it out through consensus'.  The fact of the matter is that groups that are good at consensus-building will do that <i>anyways</i> - you should be designing for the groups who <i>can't</i> - at least not yet.                        </div>

<blockquote>It does - but at the same time I think that there's a lot of design opportunities that go by the wayside if you just handwave the problem as 'let the players figure it out through consensus'. The fact of the matter is that groups that are good at consensus-building will do that anyways - you should be designing for the groups who can't - at least not yet.</blockquote>
