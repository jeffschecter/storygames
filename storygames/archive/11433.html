They didn't - in fact, it's much more conservative strands that have made the most gains (in fact, in a rare event that united where I live with where I study, the conservatives who split from the American Episcopal church over ordaining gay ministers joined up with an African branch of the church).  It also reminded me of the (largely unrealistic) speculation that a liberation theologian might be chosen to replace John Paul II as pope or (more realistically) a conservative Latin American or African cleric.  I've also been thinking about games that can have lots of juicy conflict without much - if any - violence (you know, like a lot of real life).<br/><br/>Anyway, so I've been toying with the idea of a game centering around the fictional bid of a liberation theology candidate for the papacy - lots of back-room politicking, idealism and cynicism mixing, questions of the reality/efficacy of faith, etc.<br/><br/>I've already considered PTA, which I think might work.  So might Burning X, but I really don't want to spend the time coming up with all the lifepaths (and hacking, say, the Burning Empires church lifepaths might work OK but would lose a lot of flavor).  I'm currently thinking of setting it in the modern day, but any real-world setting since the 1960s would probably work (no one says we have to keep when the Pope really dies as fact), and I could see interesting fantasy ones (though I like modern stuff - I'd be more interested in fantasy-modern, like Kings, than elves and popes).<br/><br/>Ideas?  Does this sound like the sort of thing anyone would play (not that you would, since it'd be run in Baltimore if it happened, and no one lives here...)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254532/#Comment_254532" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T13:01:46+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  1:01PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I played in the fantasy version of that game under the Burning Wheel rules and it rocked.

You just have to set the ground rules and expectations. There's nothing inherently "forcing funny" in the rules, but that's how the setup of the game plays it. If you just say, "We're taking it seriously, and so please don't go down the "comedy" hole", and reinforce this in the game ("Hey John, sorry, we all agreed to do this without the comedy. Would it be ok if you did something else at the end there?") as you play.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254692/#Comment_254692" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T05:37:42+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  5:37AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Anna">@Anna</a>: I second that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> a highly policktickal game would be awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254696/#Comment_254696" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T05:51:34+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  5:51AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Zac">@Zac</a>.

Without the roach cards, and the central choice, the game lacks a lot of direction and interest.  The dice gained from narrating in groups of random people on your side adds strongly to the madcap feel.  The fact that each portion of the game is a discrete event means that it kind of discourages elaborate advance planning on the part of the characters in favor of sudden bouts of depravity and nasty bon mots.  <br/><br/>It's hard to see how one could do much better than Duel of Wits for clerical debate.  I think the first priority in choosing a system should be one that lets arguments end up in compromises that nobody really wanted.  BW and Houses of the Blooded are the first systems that come to mind, although HotB can get a little crazy for something theoretically grounded in reality.  Maybe use the stripped-down mouse guard version of BW?  Reskinning the MG "recruitment" section to represent the different phases of a career in the church (and life before ordination) could be fun, and the different ranks could be adjusted easily enough as well.  I also hear good things about the social conflict mini-game in Diaspora, so maybe something FATE-y?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254716/#Comment_254716" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T07:39:13+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  7:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to toss in another vote for Burning Wheel.
