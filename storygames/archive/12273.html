That doesn't mean you should be interested in it - it's primarily gamist, and tactical combat is a big focus of it.  There is zero support for a narrativist agenda, and the new skill challenge mechanic is actively harmful to a simulationist agenda (at least as I've seen it used).  Combat duration is about on par with 3e, but character creation and creating encounters is significantly easier.  RPGA fans are (rightfully) pissed off because Wizards seriously botched the transition from 3e to 4e in their organized play worlds.  That said, they are doing some good things with organized play in 4e.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting side note about 4e and organized play:<br/>\nIn 3.0-3.5 organized play took the form of Living Greyhawk, in which you could play an adventure with a character, and the DM would record your participation and rewards, and send them in to Wizards, which would track all that info.  The tracking was fairly extensive, to make sure that nobody did anything with their character that they hadn't earned by playing an adventure.  In 4.0 there is, for all practical purposes, no tracking.  Furthermore players will soon be allowed to create characters at higher levels, in order to be able to participate in a group for which they don't have a character.  I think this is an interesting departure from the notion that you need to 'earn' character achievements.  Wizards is able to do this because in 4e they finally have a system which is sufficiently well balanced to allow someone to create a higher level character without worrying that they will create a character than can make the rest of the party irrelevant because it is so overpowered.  Naturally there is kickback from people who believe that character competence should be earned, but I think this is an interesting development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275149/#Comment_275149" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T09:23:53+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  9:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny - 4e and my interest in more narrative games happened at around the same time and one has only increased my interest in the other.

I notice that my group's favourite game for easily 80% of those two decades was some flavour of the HERO system.<br/><br/>4e seems to remind me very strongly of the HERO system, in several ways:<br/><br/>- strong focus on tactical encounters that provide "real tactical options" and not just narrative flavour with ambiguously associated mechanics<br/><br/>- strong dissociation between tactical encounter play and "narrative, we get-to-the-next encounter play" (i.e. there nights that are 'fight nights' and nights when nobody really rolls dice): in an odd way, this leads me to believe that in some ways 4e is actually very old school<br/><br/>- somewhat intricate, min-maxey character creation that's actually pretty front-end loaded and benefits from a strategic vision and planning<br/><br/>- a system that's slowly being over-burdened with added mechanical splats (modulo the last point)<br/><br/>- a game that's <i>vastly</i> improved in prep-time efficiency, on player and GM end, by strong reliance on software tools<br/><br/>Until D&amp;D Character Builder came along my vote for "best character creation software evahr" was the HeroDesigner software, to the point that I could not really conceive of playing the HERO system without it any more. I think I can easily make the same claim with respect to Character Builder: is it perfect? No. Is it too self-contained and not flexible enough? Yes. However, for what it does, it's an incredibly easy tool to use.<br/><br/>Our entire group was able to whip up characters (and maintain them) quite easily with Character Builder, and I think anyone playing 4e ought to use it (or have some analogous system that works for them and makes character/encounter creation/maintenance that much easier).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275176/#Comment_275176" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T12:05:28+00:00" title="June  9, 2010 12:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting article.

I got my start in RPGs when D&amp;D was first published, playing at the MIT Strategic Games Society (which I started hanging out with in Junior High), and continued to play there at least occasionally through grad school, although also playing at the UMass Wargaming Society (or whatever it was called).  I was involved in the Wild Hunt form the start, and went to local New England wargaming and SF conventions.  And yes, the exact players in club games varied from week-to-week, the basic circle of people did not.  People played the the same characters for <em>years</em> (it was common to have a small stable of long term of characters).  People did move characters between games, but unless the games were linked (as many of the MITSGS games were, taking place on different parts of the same world -- there was a map on the wall showing what was where), it was a difficult process and not done too casually.  The entire play group would not play in any <i>particular</i> game, but any particular campaign would have a core group, several of which would usually be in any play session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275218/#Comment_275218" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T15:10:03+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  3:10PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 3:41PM by deadlytoque.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually interviewed Rob Heinsoo (lead developer at the start of 4E) and Robin D.

They doesn't go into the whole "why is 4E the way it is?" question in the interview, but listening to them talk to other people at the con, they basically said that they had realized that 3E was the best simulation-style game (and yes, Heinsoo said those words) that they could really come up with, and so for them to do more of the same wouldn't really be worth their time, so they set out to make 4E a brand new game.<br/><br/>One thing they do talk about is the influence of MMOs on 4E, specifically in the realm of front-loading; they recounts discussions with younger gamers about how playing low-level D&amp;D was less fun, because the survivability of low-level characters against anything beyond rats was so limited, and the related development of the structure of Powers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This impression is way wrong. You pick a few things from a short list at each stage of character creation. Combat length varies enormously depending on the combat.</blockquote>\nMy experience with 4E map to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdcore" title="nerdcore"><img alt="nerdcore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdcore">nerdcore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275377/#Comment_275377" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T12:51:12+00:00" title="June 10, 2010 12:51PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed 4e is a action/combat driven game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you play it you can always take the "easy way out" and play a massive, complex and tatical (and also fun) chess match.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff course there is room for roleplay, but the DM will need to explain to the players that for some time during the session there will be almost no dice rolling, so they don't get disappointed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all about the expectation and the social contract between DM and Players                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
