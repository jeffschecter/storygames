I've been focusing on what it's like to be a Tsolyani, in terms of culture and attitudes, and what the physical environment and indeed what the characters might look like.  This has gone pretty well, and I'm happy with what I have so far.  The point here is to have something I can hand to people who have never played in this setting, to quickly give them a sense of how their characters see the world.<br/><br/>Reading over the 13 pages I have, it occurs to me that while I can "see" what things look like, new players can't.  Also, there are certain emotional sorts of vibes that should be present in the setting, which may not be obvious.  By this I mean emotional reactions to the setting itself, on the part of the players, not the PCs, if that makes sense.  Think movie trailer, and you'll get the idea, like when you see a light saber in a Star Wars trailer, that thrill, ya know?<br/><br/>Anyway...I'm struggling to find a way, in text, to have that come across.  I've considered using art or photos, but it's hard to find ones with just the right feel.  Music seems like a good approach, as in "go listen to this". But thre are probably other techniques.  I've been writing little vignettes too.  That seems to work as well.<br/><br/>What other techniques can anyone think of?  Not Tekumel specific.  In general.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368507/#Comment_368507" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T13:28:40+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  1:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 1:29PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Seriously; try to think as a poet, and work your words in another way; create metaphors on <i>emotions</i>, and turn it all into <i>the song</i>* belonging to the language and tradition of the Tsolyani. And make it short!
