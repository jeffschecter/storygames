So it's just a tactical boardgame, rather like Mechaton? <br/><br/>Or are there long periods of roleplay, punctuated by tactical encounters?

Theirs a lot of combat because it pleases the crowd and some folk are still getting over the ' i r silly if i act out' bits. <br/><br/>That said I have never seen the tactical boardgame claim. I started with 3 and the combats are playing in much the same way except that I'm not burdened with monster types (why oh why did the undead type have 1/2 BA advancement per hd in 3.x? goodbye 30 hd undead monsters that still miss my pc's) and im not burdened with a lot of the flaws of the old system (fracturing BA's and Saves leading to just damn wierd results, shitty ass pc's, wizards who could solo most things by level 15)<br/><br/>The moral of the story, is that this dnd like the old dnd, has its roleplay&lt;---&gt;combat dial determined by whoever is deciding what to do in the game (generally the GM). <br/><br/>hope that helps                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204378/#Comment_204378" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T06:51:01+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  6:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 6:52AM by jenskot.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use to freeform roleplay, combat, freeform roleplay. <br/><br/>But 4E combat rewards playing 3 connected encounters (due to daily powers, milestones, action points, and xp). And with combats taking 45 to 90 minutes each, freeform roleplay outside of combat felt empty. You have fun freeform roleplay for 20 minutes and then to fit 3 encounters in a session you don't have time for anymore.<br/><br/>It also feels disconnected. To me, roleplaying an efficient killing machine is boring. But combat is so team focused now (which is my favorite thing about 4E) that to play inefficiently is to let your team down. <br/><br/>So we play 4E now as a tactical boardgame. A few local groups feel the same way. We still describe our powers in colorful ways but having dramatic tension outside of combat tends to be very limited. <br/><br/>Ultimately we have so many amazing games that support great roleplaying it feels strange tacking it on to 4E where it feels unsupported and distracting. <br/><br/>That being said, I've found it actually to be very important for the GM to roleplay quite a bit in combat. Breathing life into the monsters and describing the encounters colorfully seems to add a lot to the game while not slowing things down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204425/#Comment_204425" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:44:05+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:44AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started playing 4e about a month ago with my dysfunctional, DnD-only gaming group of many years. I was getting a little tired of 3.5e so was happy when we retired a stale campaign and a fellow player volunteered to run 4e, which he'd had some experience with. I had read a lot of high praise hereabouts about 4e and how it was easier to get into ruleswise, more story-gamey and had quicker combat. So far, I'm pretty underwhelmed by it as a system.<br/><br/>I don't see any story game elements in the rules, which sucks, because my group is diverse and while they're not opposed to actual roleplaying, it's kind of hard to get that happening consistently. I was hoping for some more rules that would encourage drama and character building, but there's nothing like that. The crown jewel is apparently the skills challenge system, which as mentioned in a recent thread here, is nothing more, ruleswise, than getting players to go around in a circle and make simple skill rolls until the group accumulates enough successes. In said thread some peoples' suggestion was to just 'add roleplay'. The rules for this should facilitate roleplay and don't, in my opinion. During our first skill challenge, my group stared blankly at the DM when he explained it and their eyes glazed over as soon as the dice started rolling. He tried to add bonuses for roleplaying, but it felt like a tacked-on incentive and probably threw the math off and made it easier than it should have been.<br/><br/>That's not my main problem with the game though. I've developed a sort of love/hate relationship with DnD. I hate that it's been the only game that I've been able to play and I hate the leveling treadmill and I hate that it doesn't have good rules support for non-combat situations. What I love about DnD is the weird kind of personality it's developed over the years, with all its crazy monsters, the bizarre alignment system, the dynamics between the core classes and its wonderful magic system, among other things. There's a lot of things that are distinctly Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>I think 3.5e was a revelation. It took all the idiotic, arbitrary and clumsy rules and stripped most of them away. It added new rules like skills, feats and prestige classes that helped defined ones character, even if a lot of those features were combat-related. Don't get me wrong, 3.5e is still clunky, but it's definitely still DnD. 4e feels like a dumbing down and a desperate appeal to online gamers. The thing is, games like World of Warcraft borrowed from DnD, stripped away all the roleplay elements and rendered all the abilities into predictable, easily programmed procedures. What's more, WoW and its ilk are dumb. There is little actual tactical play. It's button mashing and a monkey with a head wound could probably manage to make it to level 80. I think they made a mistake in throwing out a pretty good, mature and deep rules system, and replacing it with its simpleton mutant offspring.<br/><br/>I think the clearest example of this is in the way they handled classes, which is probably the heart of DnD. The classes used to be quite distinct but now they all feel pretty much the same. They all have these wacky powers that are almost completely abstract and nonsensical, but not really distinctive (which is how it works in computer RPGS generally). It's all about the cold mechanics, it seems. The basic classes in 3.5 felt so distinctive from each other. When you were playing a wizard, you were playing a wizard, and you had all these crazy spells that required some clever resource management. You had odd spells that you could be extremely creative with during and after combat. Now it's mainly just number crunching. It just seems like they've taken away a lot of potential for creative solutions to problems all around, which is criminal.<br/><br/>This isn't to say 4e is terrible, but I don't think it delivered on many of its promises. It is different, but in this case I'd lean towards bad different, and I think my gaming group would too. They definitely are not story-gamer types, but even they find 4e lacking soul and personality. That said, the combat is basically fun, if you look at nothing but the rules. It's more coherent ruleswise and probably easier to pick up than 3.5e combat. It's definitely easier to whip up characters and I do like the way the monsters work. That's probably the best change I've seen. I haven't really seen evidence that the combat is significantly shorter than in 3.5e (especially since it's encouraged to string three combats together in a row) but it seems like setup is easier for the DM.<br/><br/>So, my soapbox diatribe aside, I think that yes, 4e works better as a standalone tactical combat game but 3.5e is still better for the complete campaign-style RPG package.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204428/#Comment_204428" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:52:35+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:52AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we played it, the tactical combats took just so damned long that there wasn't any time for any role-playing in the sessions.

I ran urban settings, so when I ran 4E that meant the session consisted of roleplaying out an excuse for a fight and then the combat encounter, although sometimes the order would be reversed. There was also the occasional skill challenge, but those were usually fairly lack-luster - this was before the errata which converted skill challenges from being insanely hard to being ludicrously easy. <br/><br/>I'm hacking 4E for pretty much this reason. I like the combat system it's fun and flexible. I'm just seeing how far I can pull that fun and flexibility outside of combat by stretching those mechanics. That and I think that the 4E combat encounter system is stable enough to support more player buy-in than it currently has.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204439/#Comment_204439" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T09:20:18+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  9:20AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played it, I dunno, three of four times?

The rest of the group had already finished part 1 and I entered as they were just starting part 2.  The GM gave me some background information on why I was where I was, and the campaign itself came with "hooks" which are backgrounds you can pick that give you a small bonus to a skill and supposedly will become more important as the campaign goes on.<br/><br/>I chose "wandering duelist" and after I found out what happened in the first part (the party had kicked the butt of a small army of monsters that were threatening a local town, returned with the townsfolk who had been kidnapped and were currently being feted by the locals), I thought I'd try playing that to the hilt.  I showed up and challenged one of the PCs to a duel.  After all, they were the biggest badasses I could find.<br/><br/>That was about the extent of my roleplaying.  It was a good place to start, certainly, but once I'd been accepted by the party, we just proceeded from fight to fight.  In between you might get a skill challenge, but even there, the mechanics were what you were concentrating on.  You're too busy deciding what skill to roll next and how many successes versus failures that the actual events get glossed over.<br/><br/>I even tried role-playing WITHIN the combat encounters, but the rules just got in the way.  I'm playing a Tempest fighter -- dual weapons, leaping about from opponent to opponent and spinning like a dervish attacking anything in sight.  I started out describing things that way.  By the third combat it turned into a CCG war game.  "I play my 'Sweeping Blow' attack."  <br/><br/>Could we role-play more?  Sure.  But it feels like everything in the system is pulling against that.  I'd be roleplaying despite the game, not because of it.<br/><br/>Part of the problem, I think, is how encyclopedic the rules are.  There is a rule, literally, for everything.  Jumping.  Jumping up.  Long jumps.  Jumping and missing not because you didn't jump far enough but because you ran out of 'movement' in your turn.  Jumping down, i.e. a 'controlled fall' - which uses Acrobatics, not Athletics.  Do you divide the result by 5 or by 10 to get squares?  It got to the point that when I mentioned the possibility of jumping across a piece of tough terrain, everyone rolled their eyes.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on climbing.  I have to roll successfully HOW many times? <br/><br/>Having that many rules really feels oppressive more than anything else.  Since playing 4E, I've started to fall in love with rule-sets like <a href="http://microlite20.net/" rel="nofollow">microlite20</a>.  The concept of 'rulings not rules'. Any game that has a skill list with more than 4 entries makes me break out in hives. <br/><br/>I'm having fun with the campaign, and I'll certainly continue to play, but only because I've learned to treat it the way I would Diablo, or more accurately, a JRPG.  There's story, sure, but it's big sweeping stuff that happens in the background.  I only get to really, meaningfully control my little avatar when the battle theme kicks in and my menu of options comes up.  Other than that, it's watching cutscenes.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204450/#Comment_204450" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T09:53:59+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  9:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>That said, despite the game's mechanics being pretty brilliant, in my opinion, its systematic support of shared imagining among players is scant.

I really like board games, particularly cooperative tactical ones like Pandemic and Shadows Over Camelot, and I treat D&amp;D as a bigger, longer-lasting version of them.  I get a lot of gamey reward out of it and I don't have to muck around trying to create an interesting story without any rules support.<br/><br/>My group has been making noise lately about wanting to introduce RP into our (highly irregular) game, which I've resisted; I'd rather just chuck D&amp;D temporarily and bust out IAWA or Perfect.  "Right tools for the right job" seems like pretty basic system-matters stuff to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204462/#Comment_204462" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T10:50:28+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 10:50AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that I play 4e "like a tactical boardgame", but the tactical fights are the most interesting part of the game, so I certainly look forward to them.  Of course the same could be said of 3.5, Castles &amp; Crusades, GURPS and most of the standard games out there.  Most everything outside of combat was pixel-bitching investigative work or "immersive" fluff that didn't really carry any weight of its own and only felt important and interesting if it revealed a clue in the investigation or lead to a fight.  Any drama was added, intentionally or not, <i>outside</i> of the system itself.<br/><br/>Honestly, the only thing that makes 4e any less "roleplayish" than its contemporaries is that yes, the combats take a while, cutting into your investigation and fluff time.  Other games often have the same problem, but since the combats are generally less "tuned" the GM is more likely to throw a bunch of underpowered or "glass cannon" encounters at the PCs, or fudge the HPs of the monsters just to move things along.<br/><br/>Combat and traps and adventure are just what D&amp;D is.  Everything else is pretty much just color.  I commented to a friend recently that according to the rules, defining a Warlock's pact (arguably the most important and interesting thing about the class) is ENTIRELY optional.  When creating a Warlock, the game doesn't require you to write down anything about your pact other than its general source, and even that is nearly meaningless.  But my friend pointed out that if you make each character too interesting, it throws off the whole "heroic adventure party vibe" which D&amp;D REQUIRES to function.  Once you split the party it's all chaos and madness from that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204465/#Comment_204465" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T10:54:33+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 10:54AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in Jenskot's group, and occasionally his GM. <br/><br/>It's a tactical boardgame with some trash talking and some colorful description.

Rogues (strikers) will lack much in the way of healing (the purview of leaders), or area damage (controllers), or "tanking" (defenders).<br/><br/>Of course, when thinking about 4E, you have to consider classes a little bit differently.  You could have easily have a group full of "thieves", wherein each character is actually a different mechanical class.  I could have a Fighter trained in Thievery, and he'd be as much of a thief as a Rogue trained in Thievery.  4E classes are, for the most part, essentially just combat styles, rather than occupations or character definitions.  You pick whatever combat style suits you, and add your character flavour to taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204506/#Comment_204506" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T12:22:59+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 12:22PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>does the system rely on a balance of classes?

Would the combat work?</blockquote>\nI would say that the system promotes balanced classes but does not rely on it. But encounters can rely on a balance of classes. So if you customize the encounter to match your needs, the system should work fine. <br/><br/>It would actually be very easy to play a group of all thieves. There are 4 different builds of rogues. The trickster rogue, brawny rogue, aerialist rogue, and the cutthroat rogue. And there are other classes that could be reskinned to work as rogues. Just replace two of their class skills with thievery and perception.<br/><br/>I'd echo a few of the comments above. 3E wasn't less of a tactical boardgame but it did have many simulation elements. Suspension of disbelief mattered more. In 4E all that goes out the window. So I do feel there are huge differences between Shadowrun and Gurps vs. 4E. A warlord could smack you and then 2 of her friends heal 5 hit points and someone else is pushed back 3 squares. It's all about what is cool as a tactical game and the color is put on top of it. You are not playing a fighter, you are playing a CCG deck of Magic cards. In a movie a fight might do cool grappling moves but in 4E you might have to be a different class to do what you imagine your fighter could do. And as you level up you can reshuffle your magic card deck and all of a sudden powers you could do before you forgot and in their place you suddenly remember new powers. The fiction is very secondary. <br/><br/>That being said, if you want to do more freeform roleplaying on top of 4E, I would suggest giving the players free intimidate checks against monsters that are bloodied (except for solos and elites) or cut all monster hit points in half. Also avoid monsters that have high hit points and high defenses. It's generally more fun if monsters do more damage but fall down quicker or in a more reasonable length of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204520/#Comment_204520" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T13:16:17+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  1:16PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it twice.

We tend to alternate between talky sessions, with little to no dice rolling and "big fight" sessions which are pure tactical encounters.  I have to admit that I am less excited about the talking, and much more excited about the combat, so in that way I am treating it like a grand tactical boardgame.  However, I have noticed that as we started to build up the fiction, considerations other than the current tactical situation began to impinge on our battles, and that is really cool.<br><br>As an example: I'm playing a Fighter, and several sessions ago I picked up sidekick in the form of a goblin named Cepug.  The GM gave me a stat block card for a low level Goblin skirmisher, and some rules describe what influence I have over him (normally I have to use my minor action to order him to move around, I spend my healing surges to allow him to recover, occasionally the GM has him do stuff, and if I don't want that I have to use Intimidate or whatnot to get him back in line).<br><br/>So far, just another game piece for the grand tactical battle, but in roleplay I've established a relationship with the little guy, and my character Karnak takes his responsibility for Cepug's welfare and training seriously.  As a result, in recent battles there have been several times when I've made less than tactically optimal decisions in order to keep Cepug from getting killed.<br/><br/>In summary: D&amp;D4e is in a very large part a grand tactical boardgame, but one in which concerns developed in the fiction can bleed over into the boardgame, (or conversely, decisions made in the boardgame can have repercussions in the fiction).  And it's the combination of crunchy tactics with a larger scenario to give the battles context that I like.<br/><br/>And as others have said, I've got plenty of other games to play if I want to play a talky relationship game.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204570/#Comment_204570" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T17:16:55+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  5:16PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: peccable</cite><br/>Don't get me started on climbing.

In game, he was a sixteen-year-old who had the expectations and hopes of his whole village on his shoulders because he was supposed to be the next baron. When he and his twin sister turned 16, and the black dragon who'd killed his father and laid claim to the town demanded her, he stood up with the rest of the heroes, slew him, and became the next baron, and promptly found himself completely in over his head. In despair, he made pacts with Lovecraftian horrors from beyond the stars for power. When it came down to it, though, they couldn't save his sister; she died during the final, epic spell to restore their home to its normal place in the world. So, he forsook his pact. In mechanical terms, he was re-training over several levels out of warlock. In game terms, every time he could have used his warlock powers but didn't said something about this sixteen year old boy and the enormous pressures he was dealing with. By the same token, the first time he used his warlock powers was a bit of an event in-game, because people started wondering what had happened to him.<br/><br/>There are simpler ways to do it, too; to borrow from comics, Batman never uses a gun, which sometimes comes up. So the way he fights says something about him. I've encouraged my players to level up in the middle of the game, and whip out new powers when they're really in a pinch--so it's that classic moment of finding yourself up against the wall, nowhere to run, and you dig deep inside yourself and find more there than you ever would have expected before.<br/><br/>Ludanto: Much easier question. Lots of little things add up: roll damage with your attack, if a player doesn't have an idea of what he's doing, he's delaying, that kind of thing. Also, not all enemies will fight to the death. Throwing in a skill challenge that can end the fight sooner is often a good way to go. I've built whole sessions just out of skill challenges. Basically, I think of D&amp;D as a good game to play a solid action movie, so I go with the way fights work in good action movies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204573/#Comment_204573" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T17:29:10+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  5:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that my responsibility as a D&amp;D4 GM is to give the players interesting things to kill, and as a player what I want out of the game is to be interested in killing things.<br/><br/>So, there's a tactical boardgame going on, sure, but without some colour added in to take it beyond that I would probably be a little disappointed.

I jumped in to 4E (after 3E drove me away from the game I grew up on) with the hopes it would be a return to faster combats, simpler stat blocks, and more roleplaying focus. After 6-months of experience with it, I find it has none of that - a combat encounter typically takes 60+ minutes, the stat blocks are smaller than 3E's but still way too dense, and the game, irregardless of what a few people claim about skill challenges (which suck anyways IMHO because they typically play like a CRPG), supports very little actual roleplay - it's all about combat. <br/><br/>The combat is fun, but gets repetitive fast, especially after a few encounters at any given level. Every fight basically feels the same. Even as you level up, powers largely just scale up in damage and size of effect, so they still feel the same to me. There is almost no roleplay to the games I've run, unless I force it, because that's not what it's about: Characters are built around combat and aside from a few skills, which you have little way of focusing on (e.g., virtually every Wizard has the exact same Arcane skill modifier) and the performance of which is very erratic thanks to the nature of the flat d20 probability curve, there is nothing in the game that supports anything but combat. <br/><br/>The "balance" of the game is part of the culprit to making everything feel the same - as characters go up in level, everything scales up with them, so that, in effect, your character never really gets any better at anything.... monsters get tougher &amp; harder to hit, DCs go up so you're always looking at rolling approximately the same # to succeed, and magic items are necessary just to maintain parity with the monsters.<br/><br/>Combat encounters also feel very contrived because you can break the game simply by not allowing players to take short rests between encounters: If the monsters in the next room come in at the end of combat (say responding to the noise of their friends being slaughtered), you prevent encounter powers from resetting, and can TPK a group pretty easily. This is probably the part of the game that feels the most like a CRPG to me - monsters need to "spawn" only when a group hits a certain waypoint or the whole system falls apart.<br/><br/>I also have to admit that it also makes me ill to see players with their character sheet, and a dozen + cards spread out in front of them.... the whole table is covered in cards with the exception of the area taken up by the map.<br/><br/>I've run 4E for approximately 6-months with a group of 6 15-17 year-olds. With them, the game plays no different than a tactical miniatures game. They move squares, use powers, and kill shit. Almost all of the play WoW and see the resemblance, so much so that they often make jokes about it (e.g., "I click 'accept mission'"). To be honest, it makes me sad.<br/><br/>For a change of pace, I'm running a "D&amp;D day" next month using the Basic/Expert rules and one of the players asked me "are we going to get to roleplay or it going to be like 4th edition?" When I explained that it was going to involve a lot more roleplaying, puzzle solving, and there weren't any special powers that go off every round, he was excited. That really surprised me.  Everyone was really excited when we rolled up characters and it took all of 30 minutes for everyone.<br/><br/>Why have I kept running the 4E game if I don't like it? I wanted to give it a fair shot and figured that the RP side would develop once the players got the hang of combat &amp; the teamwork it involves (which IMO is the best part of the game). Unfortunately it didn't and so we'll wrap up our campaign in two weeks and I will run something different next year because 4E isn't really conducive to teaching "roleplaying."  Sure we can free roleplay, but the only interesting part of the characters, and the game itself, are the combat rules so every single game I've run ends up focusing on it.<br/><br/>I've also run 4E with adults (though my main group won't go near it - we're playing Burning Wheel) and the results are pretty similar, though without the WoW remarks. We've had some very cool and very funny roleplaying experiences but those only occurred when we just dumped the rules and let the group do what they would which is much easier with adults who want to roleplay. That said, the characters still aren't "cool" unless they're using <i>twin strike</i> or  <i>king's castle</i>.<br/><br/>For D&amp;D, after a lot of years of trying various additions, I think the best versions of the game were the original ones - I'm a fan of the basic versions (Moldvay &amp; Mentzer), as well as 1st ed. AD&amp;D if you strip out all that weapon speed factor, vs. AC garbage.  Anything since then just has layered more and more crunch and forced "balance" on to the game which has make it feel more like a CRPG and less like the game I grew up on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exedore6" title="exedore6"><img alt="exedore6" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exedore6">exedore6</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204643/#Comment_204643" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T05:36:49+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  5:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MJ - I'm running a game with some people, same age group as you (15-17) having the opposite experience. The players are all new to pen &amp; paper gaming, old hats at MMO gaming. I'm using Shadowfell (which, is very, very fighty, and I'm regretting the choice due to length), and I started with "Let's play this out as a tactical game, and see what develops", mostly because the players were new, and some people just want a tactical board game (always have).<br/><br/>What I found was that the group spontaneously began filling in backstory for their characters. Full of bangs, full of buttons I can press to actually get the RP in the Game. Sure, there are some players who seem to be interested in killing stuff at the moment, and that does eat up a lot of time (though I'm convinced that the system can support quick battles, we'll see). There are also players who are there to be with their friends and would be just as happy playing UNO.<br/><br/>I guess my point isn't that I think the system <b>encourages</b> players to be interested in anything but tactical combat. The light approach leaves plenty of room to have a non-battle driven game, without the rules getting in the way. I'm curious what happens if a skill challenge becomes more like a Duel of Wits, where the intent and consequences are known going in, the players can be on the receiving end, and the players <b>have</b> to accept the results, or escalate.<br/><br/>I agree that the older systems were pretty sweet, and intend to give them a spin one day, 2-3.5 pushed me away, with 3.5 hardly being distinguishable from GURPS to me (for the record, I love gurps).

So there is no fruitful void for rich fiction to affect in 4th edition, which makes the rpg content distracting and confusing instead of enriching.<br/><br/>Which is to say, my experience is also that 4th edition runs best as a boardgame.Approaching it like a rpg gets confusing and painful for me because then we're constantly doubting the rules; any rule might give way at any moment due to how it's not concordant with the fiction. Then there's the fact that the rules are so carefully balanced that inserting roleplaying-derived aspects actually throws the balance out and makes the rules under-perform, just like if you insisted on giving your orcs in Warhammer some extra bonuses due to how they're special orcs. Even worse, set-piece encounters won't work if the players don't stay in the play-pen, so there's lots of pressure on the players to just be nice and follow the rails. This in turn translates into frustration and willingness to just sit there dumbly while the GM sets up the next combat encounter. All this is made much more functional by bringing the combat scenario boardgame explicitly on the table: the players can just ask the GM to tell them what the next combat is about, he can tell them, and then we can proceed into setting up the encounter instead of arguing about whether the rogue entered the room alone (and died) or with the whole party in tow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204648/#Comment_204648" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T06:21:13+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:21AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta say, not my experience either. Sure, it's totally possible *and fun, for a change* to play D&amp;D as tactical boardgame. And in the group I play with that plays everything like that, we play 4E like that. It's fun. In the other three groups, though, the RP is pretty much the same as it ever was, with one important difference.<br/><br/>In 3e (and a number of other games), a number of players followed the pattern of "roleplaying is what you do out of combat" religiously - to the point that I nearly had a group break up over it, because a couple players' RP-driven combat decisions were seen as stupidly suboptimal. The reason why: combat was so random and so swingy that slight mistakes could result in TPK, and PCs combat options were typically "I do one thing really really well, and suck at everything else, so I should do my one thing or get out of the way".<br/><br/>I've seen a LOT less of that in 4E. The party can usually make up for a bad choice or two, and characters have more choices that fall into the "okay but not optimal" bucket. It's hard to get a TPK - there's usually time to recognize the situation and organize a retreat in order. The daredevil players are happy, the cunning tacticians are happy, and the scenery chewers are happy - at the same table, in the same scenes! This didn't happen a lot in the past.<br/><br/>I would say that the table I consider most representative - all adults, regular ongoing game, good social bonds - has the most "roleplaying", just as I'd expect. Erzuli is brilliant but socially clueless and a source of a great deal of deadpan humor; Petra is untrusting, cynical, but intensely honorable and brave; Lia is tentative, a bit nervous, but eager to help - and clearly struggles with her religious commitments vs her native bloody-mindedness; Raime is quiet, internal, efficient - we haven't seen much of him outside of his shell yet; Selina is undependable, mercenary, fond of her earthy pleasures, and vengeful as all get out; and Caravas is pompous, outgoing, a bit unworldly, and sometimes patronizing, but he is for all that a good leader, generous and protective towards his companions.<br/><br/>Almost all of that has come out through play with plenty of fighty.<br/><br/>D&amp;D's never going to be a "story game" in the more literary sense of the term. It's an action-movie, a pulpy 5-man-band vs Bad Guys. That's what it does best, and it isn't ashamed of it. Characters in that sort of fiction are defined through shtick, witty banter, signature moves, and the like. They "grow" - as much as they do - through reveals, power-ups, and confrontations with obstacles. Everything beyond that is going to have to be brought by the players. So far, my experience of 4E is that it works very well for the basics, and doesn't impede the development of character &amp; story that go beyond that. It's at least as good as prior D&amp;D editions in that respect, and better in some ways.<br/><br/>In the end, I expect it comes down to what you define as "story" and how you want your game to facilitate it. D&amp;D's solidly in the tradition of games that mostly just get out of the way where narrative is concerned. I've found it to get out of the way better than many others, while still reliably delivering the core gameplay that I want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204649/#Comment_204649" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T06:33:38+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>Graham - As an example, ..</blockquote>\nSo it's still a tactical wargame then, but with colour?

D&amp;D needs lots of combat, like others have said upthread. So it works nicely if you're dealing with characters who express themselves by what they do (or won't do) in the middle of a fight. I think the latest Hulk movie provided a good example: nearly wall-to-wall fighting, but the nature of the character meant that we were getting a definite statement about the character by the way he fought, the way he acted in those fights, what he did, and what he wouldn't do. I think that's probably a good rule for your typical action movie, and for a good D&amp;D story; you're going to be focused mostly on the combat, so make it a story, and make them characters, that find their best expression not in interpersonal drama or exposition, but in what they do in the middle of combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204651/#Comment_204651" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T06:53:41+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:53AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, we needn't reach a consensus in this thread.

But the things that are different about 4E is that it has mechanics and resources that reward you for playing out 3 combats in a day. If you play 1, even if you make the encounter super difficult, it's still easy and less fun as the way resources work, it expects you to play 3 combats. But if you play 3 combats, with each taking 45-90 minutes, even if you don't care about system supporting roleplay, you just don't have the time. There are definitely hacks you can make to customize all this to your own group (cut down healing surges, hit points, free intimidate checks when characters are bloodied, get rid of the milestone system, limit dailies in some way) but that's the case with any game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204668/#Comment_204668" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:43:53+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:43AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 7:48AM by Dave L.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing 4E for a while now.

However, if the character fails, assume they fall from the top. Give them additional rolls to cut the distance in half. So if the rogue is climbing a 100-foot tower and fails, he will fall 100 feet. He rolls again, and succeeds: now it's a 50-foot fall. He rolls again, and succeeds: now it's a 25-foot fall. He rolls again, and fails.

That is, I agree <i>for me</i> as a role-player. <br/><br/>Here's an example. I think Mutants &amp; Masterminds is a pretty damn neat RPG. And, I played it some with my local group a couple years back. We did this thing where we switched off GMing duty, which sounded great. When it was my turn to GM, I was fucking useless! I kept getting hung up that, oh, the game didn't have enough role-play supporting Flags for players or whatever. But, when others GM'd, while it wasn't the Shangri-La of role-playing, obviously they weren't having a hard time. They were just doing what they always did as GMs (the didn't have much indie exposure). <br/><br/>I saw the same thing happen when I tried to run D&amp;D 3.5 recently, and D&amp;D 4E. I would just run fights, because I knew the rules well. But, the actual role-play stuff just shriveled to the point it was just me running tactical encounters. I'd "ruined" myself as a GM in most traditional games because I keep looking for things that aren't there, and then getting frustrated and having no fun.<br/><br/>I think it's easy to sum up as: I lost the skills I once had at running more traditional style games. I gained other new skills, sure. But, in some cases they hurt me far more than helped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204677/#Comment_204677" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:54:16+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My local game started out very fight-y.

The group's structured around the idea of the city watch in a city of giants, so they get to do some police work (investigations &amp; interrogations) in the gaps between fights, and the fights will occasionally include extra tactical elements such as "keep the marketplace from burning to the ground" or "get the civilians out of harm's way and heal the casualties".<br/><br/>Overall, though, the rhythm of the game may be a little different, but the structure is similar to games I've played all over, regardless of system type.  The classic structure's fight-plot-fight or plot-fight-plot, strung together however it might work if things can go longer.  Last session was fight-long-plot-fight-fight, and ran about 6 hours.  Here's a player's summary of that session.\n<blockquote>It was a normal patrol day with a monkey on a roof and as is probably more usual that we'd like, some old lady was getting beat up in an alley.  But it's a job so saving has to happen.<br/><br/>The "perps" in this case turned out to be Gith-somethingorother.  The counterparts to the githYankee.  When they see the Gith in our midst they went batshit and turned on him spouting crap about how we were all being brainwashed or some other into thinking that he wasn't going to turn on us and destroy the universe or somesuch.  Pfft.<br/><br/>So as we're getting started on our old lady saving, she totally turns out to be more witch than old, and starts unleashing some equal opportunity lightning spells down the alleys.  After that deal-breaker we put down the old woman, we let some Gith escape, but took the ones that wouldn't leave out Gith alone prisoner.  But not before one of them could teleport somewhere with our Cleric.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and before she bit it, the old lady chewed off her own hand, which came to life, jumped on a roof, glowed, did some magic trance-inducing shit and then launched like a rocket across the city. You know, normal city stuff.<br/><br/>Interrogation of the captives begins, but are largely fruitless.  One's a hard-case, and the other is less than forthcoming, though there's some concern that by letting the hand go, we've doomed the city and everyone in it. Oh, and did they mention that our friendly watch-gith was vile and evil and was fooling us all.  Because that might have come up like 3 or 4 more times. Repetition will surely change our minds.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the Captive Cleric wakes up shackled up on the top level of the city with some big-ass giants stomping around Thor (he has some more giant type name, but thor works), the storm giant seems to be the boss here, and has other lesser (but still impressive) giants helping out.  The Gith are keeping watch.<br/><br/>Between the interrogation, and the captivity, we get to piece together that<br/>1) We've stumbled onto something way bigger than our petty concerns of the watch, and we really weren't supposed to know about it.  You know, the local populace would freak the hell out if they knew what was coming.<br/>2) The hand is the gate keeper, or the key master.  I'm not sure which, but the point was to stop the two from joining, which we totally fucked up, and now evil is on the way.  Good Going Watch<br/>3) The best thing the fire giant can think to do about us and our knowledge is to send us to fix our screw up.  Of course, that's assumed to be a death sentence, but they figure if they've got to kill us to keep the secret evil safe, they might as well soften up the secret evil first. (Good plan in my book)<br/><br/>So we get to tracking that hand because it's going to go find some arcane power to work it's key-master mojo, and before long we track down some potent places and the one where the shit is hitting the fan.<br/><br/>There's some evil summoning going on here and we clearly don't approve of this. The worst offender in the room is a mouth-monster that's full of disgusting.<br/><br/>Of course, on it's demise the portal of awful opens up and we go/get sucked through. Suddenly we're all in hell or lightning hell or some place that we were not meant to be. There's a very small safe area where we assume they've been working their mojo for the portal on this side.  But other than that, it's just fields of lightning, which look dangerous.  We're facing a whole mess of wierd demon things. A big dog thing that has a hard time staying dead, an animated tongue in a suit of armor.  And a few more that were just there to gum up the works.<br/><br/>Anyway, the suicide mission turned out not to be a suicide mission after all (booyeah!) and the portal, while not fully closed, has shrunk to a size where only manageable stuff should be able to escape.  Provided the Gith set up a new base here.<br/><br/>Also, in case it wasn't clear before, nobody should believe or trust our githyankee. He's evil, and will destroy existence.  Don't believe his lies! Seriously.</blockquote>\n[more]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204678/#Comment_204678" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:54:30+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately it's a case of proportion.  Fights take longer and are more intricate, so you can do plot-fight-plot and still feel like it's plot<b>FIIIIIIIIGHT</b>plot.  I'm okay with that, but you've gotta make sure you think about what sort of rhythm that imparts to your game.  I think of combat as the bass line of the song, and D&amp;D of any stripe, but 4E for certain, is the guy playing that song in the car with the three-foot-diameter subwoofers going BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BVVVVVVVVVVVVvvvv.  <br/><br/>If you wanna play with the graphic equalizer, though, it's an easy fiddle.  The DMG even points the way some -- I'd start cutting monster hit points down to half their current levels. It'll speed up your fights (so the bass doesn't hit so hard and it'll leave more room for RP) and it means that you run less of a risk of hitting that tired "last mile" of a fight where everyone has exhausted their interesting variety (encounter and daily powers) and is just stuck with slinging around their at-wills.  That last mile effect hasn't happened often for us (we're over half a dozen or a dozen sessions in, maybe more -- I haven't been counting), but it hasn't been absent either.<br/><br/>I would *keep* the maps and minis no matter what. Yes, yes, you could probably figure out a way to abstract that stuff, but the sense of space and terrain and movement is a very, very important part of the 4E experience for me -- far more than any previous edition's been.<br/><br/>I'd consider giving Action Points more things to do; folks can develop a surplus they can't ever use (since you can only spend one per encounter, but gain one every two scenes, until you hit a long rest &amp; reset them). In our game we'll let folks sacrifice their surplus APs to reroll a d20 roll they don't like, but other effects work as well.  You can also potentially hook aspect-like "compel-bribery" into them, to give the players a somewhat more abundant supply and to add in a little bit of story-gamey spin to things.  (We touched on stuff like this briefly with the One Bad Egg product The Unbroken, which includes a feat for taking on a Code of Honor. More stuff like that would not be hard to invent.)<br/><br/>I'd also consider recognizing that the out of combat stuff can be made to seem more vital by connecting it to an in-combat effect.  My favorite trick in this regard is to run a skill challenge as a prelude to a combat encounter.  Win the challenge, and you get to place yourselves on the map after the bad guys are placed; lose the challenge, and they place themselves after you're placed.  Win the challenge by a LOT (say, double, or without any failures), and you get to place the enemy on the map; lose the challenge BADLY, and the enemy gets to place *you*.  It makes ambushes have a lot more teeth, and when the players understand what's on the line (you only have to do it once or twice for them to realize what a skill challenge could mean for htem) it can compel them to get much more involved in the investigation leading up to said ambush.<br/><br/>I'll do other things with my game to make sure the combats are deliberately telling a piece of the big story or develop a particular character. One of my players came from a fallen Dwarven city -- why did it fall? Well, one session started with a flash-back episode. All the players except for him played minion characters trying to escape the city as it was getting overrun with demons and undead; he played himself.  The minion-PCs generally died heroically trying to help the others escape.  Character backstory emerged via a map and hit points.<br/><br/>The story's there. You just need to figure out how to use the tools provided to tell it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204680/#Comment_204680" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:54:58+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Do people in this thread who've said this is much more a boardgame-type experience have similar experiences with the previous edition of D&amp;D (3.0 or 3.5)?

Let's call it slippery ground!").and just rolling with whatever happens.  Even though it'd be ideal for each encounter to be "perfectly balanced" the real fact is that you have to ask yourself whether things are generally balanced over the course of several encounters- between party builds and monsters and terrain, sometimes a fight just swings one way or another.  With that in mind, going with the flow of adding fictional positioning hasn't shown itself to be gamebreaking to me, and honestly, players paying attention to the terrain and using positioning ("Barrel?  Roll it down the stairs at them!") has paid off in more fun and tactical choices overall.<br/><br/>I have the feeling that all the sections about how to make a -more balanced- encounter in 4E are being read as unbreakable rules instead of general rules of thumb. (I'm mean, there's a whole section on pg. 42 in the DMG for inserting random fictional positioning into combat effects- I don't take that as for show.)<br/><br/>I'm gearing up for a longer term 4E run, with the intent for only 1-2 combats a session, probably also utilizing one of the houserules online to speed up combats, but I don't expect 4E itself to "force me to roleplay less" anymore than Dogs in the Vineyard's dice mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204686/#Comment_204686" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:03:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:03AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>By the way, we needn't reach a consensus in this thread.

You can role-play while fighting. In fact, I do. Does D&amp;D spend a hell of a lot of time in combats? Yeah, always has. I still role-play during those combats. I role-play when I choose which power to take between levels. I role-play when I choose which character my cleric heals first. I role-play when I describe the powers my cleric uses. This is not just "combat with color," as a few people have put it. That color is role-playing. My character's motivations and background influence how he fights.<br/><br/>Now, I suspect when people talk about role-playing, they really mean "doing character building stuff between the fights," but that's a pretty specialized redefinition. I like that stuff, too! I think you have to work a little harder to get it out of 4E, probably because you have this giant loaded gun (the character's power cards are the bullets) and it wants desperately to be fired. <br/><br/>When the fights get old, then you take a break. Slow down the action. Do some character building. Spend some time in town. Don't rush to the next fight. If the fighting isn't getting old, no problem. If it is, why are you rushing to the next fight?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204704/#Comment_204704" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:40:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:40AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>LOL, I spontaneously converted what would have been don't know how many climb checks (even figuring it out would have been boring) to get up a tower wall into a "let it ride" - okay one check, no retries, go! approach.</blockquote>\nSlightly off topic, but I have an idea.<br/><br/>Climb checks should ALWAYS be a single roll unless you can make an interesting skill challenge of it (probably unlikely). However, if the character fails, assume they fall from the top. Give them additional rolls to cut the distance in half. So if the rogue is climbing a 100-foot tower and fails, he will fall 100 feet. He rolls again, and succeeds: now it's a 50-foot fall. He rolls again, and succeeds: now it's a 25-foot fall. He rolls again, and fails. He takes damage for the 25 feet that he fell.<br/><br/>Just emphasizing this: not all skill checks have to be part of a skill challenge.  If you're just climbing a wall, and it's not a particularly focal scene, just make it a single roll.  Done and done.  Skill challenges are for important scenes and long, protracted challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Do you play 4th Edition like a tactical boardgame? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9238/do-you-play-4th-edition-like-a-tactical-boardgame/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Do you play 4th Edition like a tactical boardgame? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9238/do-you-play-4th-edition-like-a-tactical-boardgame/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Matt SnyderI saw the same thing happen when I tried to run D&amp;D 3.5 recently, and D&amp;D 4E.

People on this forum will think "Oh, these rules focus on combat. It's a combat game". Normal people, on other forums, think "Oh, these rules focus on combat, because that's the part of the game that needs rules. It doesn't stop us doing roleplay in between, like in other editions".<br/>Graham</blockquote>\nA lot of traditional gamers play according to the rules, and if rules don't exist for what they want to do, they get uncomfortable. For example, in 4e, they've eliminated crafting skills like blacksmithing, because of this, one player in my group just assumed that it was impossible for player characters to be blacksmiths because there were no rules to support it. This is a 40 year old non-idiot who has been gaming most of his adult life. I suggested that it could probably just be assumed that his character was a blacksmith so long as he wasn't creating ridiculous things and wasn't making a fortune off of it. The DM agreed after a moment, but he obviously hadn't thought about it before then. The group as a whole was obviously a little dissatisfied with this solution. I think it felt like a band-aid and a little awkward.<br/><br/>While I'm hesitant to overgeneralise, I think it's fair to say that a lot of DnD players have similar outlooks to my group. We do roleplay, and even though some of the players obviously derive most of their pleasure from combat, everyone enjoys the RP aspect to a degree. I think more integrated mechanics that facilitated RP would help your average DND player just as much as it would your story-gamer. I'd say my group wants those rules, they just don't know they want them. It's really unfortunate how lopsided the rules are for combat vs non-combat encounters. I think it's a completely valid complaint, because if DnD wants to distinguish itself from MMOs at all, it really needs to play to the RP elements, which you can't get and probably won't ever really be able to get from code in a video game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204730/#Comment_204730" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T09:26:40+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  9:26AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in the "ebb and flow" camp, or the "commingled RP and tactical boardgame" camp, as it were. Except I have no qualms about kitbashing the hell out of the game to make it more Story Gamey. In other words, I am a huge fan of the tactical boardgame 4E, as written, but I am uncomfortable running any game with such a traditional GM-is-god-of-truth setup as is D&amp;D default, so I have worked things to have my cake and eat it too. The result is something that feels very like a video game, yes--but more like <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> meets <i>Persona 3</i> than <i>World of Warcraft</i>, and I find that most delicious.<br/><br/>The techniques I use:<br/><br/>1. <b>Personal Quests</b>, my friends. When creating a character, everyone must define at least one personal quest for their character, and are free to introduce setting elements with only general group that's-not-cool veto to stop them. These get written down on yellow index cards. During the game, anybody can pick up a yellow index card and write a new quest down. In story game land, we call these things Flags!<br/><br/>2. <b>Warmup RP</b>. If it's been a while since we last played, I give people a chance to get into their characters' heads at the start of the session, usually with a question-and-answer thing. My usual is a round-robin where each player reveals what their character thinks about somebody else's character.<br/><br/>3. <b>Alternate Skill Challenge rules</b>. I use <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/4e-fan-creations-house-rules/241440-stalker0s-obsidian-skill-challenge-system-new-version-1-2-a.html" rel="nofollow">Stalker0's Skill Challenges</a> for skill challenge encounters, and half-errataed (errataed success/fail ratio, but slightly harder than post-errata DCs) normal Skill Challenges for long-term stuff. Most notable of the latter are "faction challenges" a la <a href="http://www.grumblingdwarf.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=513" rel="nofollow">Willow Palecek</a>, which turn into more Flag/Bang stuff as people invest their downtime actions in groups/NPCs they're interested in, and cause trouble with them via their failures.<br/><br/>4. Speaking of which, <b>Explicit Downtime Mechanics</b>. See <a href="http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaign/chronicles-of-hallowdwell/wikis/strategic-actions" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is the part that makes it like <i>Persona 3</i>! You go do interesting things in between combat encounters, many of which involve or lead to RP scenes about things the players have bought into.<br/><br/>5. Also speaking of which, the <b>Wiki</b>. One player maintains an in-character journal there, which is RP awesome of the old school!<br/><br/>6. And the crowning piece, <b>Purple Index Cards</b> that reward players for seizing narrative control. The basic idea is <a href="http://www.grumblingdwarf.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=639" rel="nofollow">over here</a> -- I've since built the deck up to over 50 different cards, and the players love it. It brings the RP right into the combats sometimes!<br/><br/>Actual-play example of how all this shakes out:<br/><br/>One player is running a halfling Swordmage named Beezra. Her personal quest was "find a mate." So I made the leader of one of the factions a dashing halfling Rogue! She's spent most of her strategic actions interacting with his thieves'-guild faction, her successes leading to the two of them spending nights together.<br/><br/>To introduce some antagonism there, I created a jealous female-halfling NPC, but it turned out she wasn't even necessary to drive some conflict with the situation. Beezra built up enough successes that "Deftblade" could join the party as an NPC ally, which he did for the next delve. During the conversation in which he was introduced to the rest of the party, another player--running Hilde, the human Barbarian--played the "I Find Bloodspattered Armor Sexy" purple card to have Deftblade fall in love with her! So in the final battle of last session, he used a power to attack and switch places with an adjacent ally... which of course I narrated as him taking Hilde by the hand, whirling her around, and kissing her hand as he let go. Eliciting growls and grins from the appropriate players!<br/><br/>So, it's D&amp;D4. It's tactical boardgame. It's RPG. It's not "pure" in the system-matters never-drift-the-rules ethic, but it's totally friggin' perfect for my purposes, not failing to deliver the fun no matter which "mode" we're in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204739/#Comment_204739" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T09:58:37+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  9:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>The other stuff's really interesting, but I haven't got a coherent response yet.</blockquote>\n4th Edition does nothing to incentivize roleplaying, whether that is rewarding in-character behavior and decisions, pursuing individual goals, or giving the players any more authority than they've had in past editions.

Should we trade in those "evil" magic items for gems?  Should we go back into town to rest and risk the dungeon inhabitants regrouping/recovering or should we make another delve at half-strength?  How do we steal gems from an unkillable, invulnerable monster?  How can we avoid that party of goblins we came across?  How far can we push the deal we made with the followers of the Dark One before it breaks?  Can I find a black market source of poison?<br/><br/>Most of these challenges aren't tactical and the ones that are (getting the gems from the unkillable monster, say) were solved/addressed through free form play (i.e., in a very non-boardgamey way).<br/><br/>But playing 4E with mostly the same people, the memorable questions have all been related to tactical/board gamey elements (note: in play these are fun/interesting questions for us to address):<br/><br/>Do I really need to save my Daily?  Can we better coordinate our movement to get combat advantage?  Which power choice will work best in terms of my guy's build?  In terms of everyone elses' guys' build?  How can we set up more effective combos?<br/><br/>(As Chris says, the DM doesn't have to play everything inflexibly, but even then, the DM is still riffing on the underlying tactical game.)<br/><br/>When people talk about 4E having "less role-playing" or that they are doing "less role-playing" with it, I think they might mean that the challenges it poses (a) cannot be solved in a free-form manner (i.e. it is more like a boardgame) and (b) often take place at a scale where "where my dude is standing on the map" has a lot of weight to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204746/#Comment_204746" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T10:13:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 10:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 10:14AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I don't want to talk about what 4E is.

When playing a Wizard, you no longer have to choose between spells that are awesome in combat but less useful out of it, or awesome out-of-combat spells that make you weaker in combat.  Divorcing of those resources is part of why, to me, 4E is both a skirmish-level wargame and a role-playing game.<br/><br/>Now that my group has the basics of the game down, our typical formula for a Thursday evening is: roleplaying, skill challenge, combat encounter, roleplaying. (with some change-up here and there)<br/><br/>My current D&amp;D group are mostly trad, D&amp;D-only players.  One guy is a dirty hippie story gamer like me, but he's also tactically-minded.  And there's me, who is similar.<br/><br/>The reason that I totally see it as a role-playing game is because it has the trappings of a game that make is want to engage in a role-playing activity, so we do.  Certainly there are no build-in tools to support it, but that's because it's like almost every other trad game -- reliant on the decades-long body of knowledge that is passed down orally regarding "how to role-play."  There's role-playing during skill challenges.  There's some light RPing during a combat, but they're usually focused on me not totally wiping them out.  There is role-playing of consequences of combat &amp; the like.  And because there's little role-playing doing our fights, there's typically a great desire to get some afterwards -- ebb and flow, rather than a constant.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's why D&amp;D is both to me &amp; my group.  But that's cool, because we're (at least me &amp; the other story-gamer) the sort of folks who are down with playing some Memoir 44 before some PTA.  It's a game perhaps more geared for omni-gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204757/#Comment_204757" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T10:50:14+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 10:50AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More actual play would be good. So would more specificity about what "roleplaying" means to you, because I'm hearing two VERY distinct things: <br/><br/>1. Mechanically supported non-combat decisions/actions with consequences, OR decisions without mechanical support, but with strong mechanical feedback<br/>2. Establishment of characters, relationships, and fictional elements OUTSIDE the formal confines of mechanics - which may feed back into mechanics or not<br/><br/>Basically NO mainstream RPG has ever done much with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, and I think there's a fair amount of resistance to it in the core market. To be honest, I've begun to find it a bit constraining myself in games where it occurs - "here's a cookie for making the kinds of decisions that the game thinks should be important" works great when the game is tightly focused, but loses a certain something when trying to play a looser, more player-driven game. <br/><br/>AP example: a recent Bliss Stage interlude, in which my character really, really needed to pursue one mechanical outcome in the scene - I needed Trauma Relief something BAD, which meant going to this other character and dumping on her about how much failing in my last mission sucked for me. Mechanically, I needed that cookie. So I chose a scene with a character with whom I had a distant, conflicted relationship - somebody I wouldn't mind using that way. But the scene that happened went totally off in another direction, almost from the get-go. The thing that was true to the characters ended up with me being confronted with WHY I felt that way about the other character, and the result was - mechanically - obviously an Intimacy increase. Which I really, really did NOT need. Arguably, I was negatively affected for pursuing the character's truth. At the very least, I wasn't rewarded for it. The mechanically optimal thing to do would have been to be as callous as I needed to be to get the Trauma Relief - I went into the scene willing to sacrifice the relationship if I needed to in order to get that. I think the game was a lot richer for NOT following the cookie, in the end. I want to be clear: It's not that I looked at it mechanically and CHOSE a less-advantaged course of action in order to illustrate something about the character, like I might have in a D&amp;D game - I just played the character the way I felt I needed to, and the outcome was sub-optimal.<br/><br/>(Parenthetically, that's actually a cool thing about BS - I have found that characters CONSTANTLY develop that "life of their own" that demands these sub-optimal choices that don't feel like choices in the moment.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, lots and lots of the RP that happens in games is type #2: portrayal of character either USING mechanical actions, but without direct feedback from that decision or without ANY mechanical relevance. <br/><br/>AP example: Caravas, my Eladrin warlord, has a very heirarchal view of his companions: There's the ones who are his fated companions, the "supporting cast" in the great legend that he is building for himself as a sacrifice to the Raven Queen in order to win the freedom of the fey lady he once served; and there are the employees, who are expendable tols of necessity, certain to be replaced by his true fated companions in time. Which is which is largely determined by how they conduct themselves in battle - valor and selflessness and an intangible "favor of the gods" mark you as one of the chosen companions, whether you're being paid a retainer or not.<br/><br/>It's been incredibly interesting watching his opinions of who's "in" and who isn't shift depending on the choices of my fellow players and the luck of the dice. I don't quite think the other PCs have figured out why Caravas takes crazy risks to protect Petra and Erzuli, but is curt and cooly efficient when dealing with Lia &amp; Raime, and seems to run hot and cold toward Selina. The main way this comes out is in my tactical decisions, but it definitely plays out in other ways as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204758/#Comment_204758" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T10:51:48+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 10:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best example of a roleplaying moment in 4E was when I had a group play through the first two scenes of "Rescue at Rivenroar." Combat at the Inn was relatively straightforward, but when the group battled the Ogre pulling a cart of pitch barrels through the middle of town, with two goblin archers on the back lighting them and the Ogre hurling them against buildings and setting the town on fire, I went crazy with describing everything. <br/><br/>At one point, the group managed to set the cart on fire, and barrels were causing random explosions as the Ogre tried to free himself. One of the goblins took aim at a PC and fired and arrow, scoring a really good hit. Suddenly I realized I had screwed up, using all of the goblin's actions but not moving him away from the cart which was about to explode (which was a huge <b>tactical</b> error by me). So I described the arrow lancing into the half-elf's shoulder, and the soot covered goblin grinning through cracked and blackened teeth and calling "Oy got yu!" right before the blast from the cart hurled his flaming little body through the front door of a nearby shack.<br/><br/>The players loved it. They really got into their characters, cursing when they missed or screwed up, shouting warning to other characters, basically role-playing their characters while we did the combat. And when we screwed up, it became part of the story.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204762/#Comment_204762" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T10:57:29+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 10:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 4e game has evolved. <br/>\n<br/>\nSetup: I'm running the WotC modules more or less straight from the book. Keep on the Shadowfell was fairly hack and slash; I attribute part of this to the time we spent getting used to the system, part of it to our expectations that it would be hack and slash, and part of it to one problem player who had a tendency to critique NPC reactions fiercely when they didn't act to his character's benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of KotS, the problem player departed and I got a new player. I also resolved to rev up the roleplay aspect by making the NPCs more interesting and lively. Finally, Thunderspire Labyrinth is more conducive to roleplay; the plotline leads through an entire town and returns to it frequently. That's allowed me to establish some NPCs, play up the ones the players like, and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, said new player is setting the tone both in freeform RP and in combat RP. He publicly and explicitly notes when he's doing something tactically imperfect but in accordance with his character, which has seemed to free other players up to do the same. He also doesn't feel constrained by the tactical maneuvers presented. Things he's done in the last few fights...<br/>\n<br/>\nUsed a cloak of teleportation to teleport directly above a hovering demon, and hung onto it as it flew away.<br/>\n<br/>\nFed a healing potion to a wild boar to tame it, then rode it into combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrappled a tentacle reaching out from the floor with the intent of running around a pillar to tangle the thing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important aspect of all this is that it was ridiculously easy to adjudicate everything he did. The tools for freeform combat actions are very powerful, which does not surprise me given Rob Heinsoo's background with Feng Shui. Like Feng Shui, 4e privileges combat; also like Feng Shui, it liberates combat tactics. I don't think the text makes it clear enough how to freeform combat decisions, and it's certainly easy to get distracted by the long list of precise powers, but the support for ad libbing combat decisions and actions is there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've successfully taken the lessons I learned in my campaign and applied them to WotC's organized Living Forgotten Realms play as well, which is perhaps the pinnacle of "D&amp;D as tactical board game." It's harder, but by applying framing techniques to skill challenges as written you can encourage the roleplay. Using the modified difficulty numbers means that you do not need to be trained in a skill to successfully apply it -- that's key. By making that one change you mitigate the problem of the rough-edged barbarian who didn't train Intimidate feeling like he has to shut up because there's not a high number on his character sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are still reluctant, for obvious reasons. Verbal encouragement can help --<br/>\n<br/>\n* "You have an untrained skill of +5? OK, the difficulty is only 14, so you still have a 60% chance of succeeding even untrained." <br/>\n* "Failing this skill challenge will not keep you from getting the experience points or the treasure you expect."<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill challenges become substantially more fun when you remove the pressure of failure. I suspect that was the intent in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204765/#Comment_204765" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T11:04:40+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 11:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We play it as a mix of skirmishers and RP.

They've got 1 month to do this before the "First Trade" of the year, which is a huge economic thing for the whole region.  Along the way, they encounter a bunch of small sidequest-y stuff they can choose to take on or leave alone, based on how they want to divvy up their time knowing there's only 30 days to pull it off.<br/><br/>So the premise sets up the ratio pretty well.

I've played 4e a few times and ran it a few times. Each time with or for a different group. I was never able to get a regular group going on 4e, although I'd like to give at least a short campaign a try some day.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of flexibility in the rules. But it gets drowned out by the powers and the rules. Like most games, I found my happy place by running it light. Making more rulings than following the rules.<br/><br/>In every game I played, I used story-game techniques in skill challenges. Even with groups that weren't familiar with the concept. My antics were accepted as "not being <i>against</i> the rules" so they flew without any real advocacy on my part. The games I've played were pretty much all combat. Sort of boardgamey, I guess.<br/><br/>The games I ran went a little differently. The first one was very boardgamey. It was with 5 guys who did not know the rules and whom I had not met before. Not a great experience for anyone. The next couple were better with a moderate amount of what old-schoolers would term roleplay. Stuff like describing characters and powers and interacting with NPCs and such. Things came to a screeching halt when combat came around. But a lot of that is due to reasons already touched upon here and my not being familiar with what types of monsters were "fun" versus those that were a drag.<br/><br/>The more I play/run/read about/prep for 4e, the more I'm reminded of my experience with HeroQuest (the rpg, not boardgame). I mean, when it first came out, I had no clue what to do with it. It wasn't until after I figured out what Conflict Resolution meant and how to set stakes that it really gelled for me. Unfortunately, that was after I'd subjected all my friends to sub-optimal, still-trying-to-figure-this-out RPing.<br/><br/>Some of those same experiences have informed 4e for me. Things like making failure interesting and Conflict (not Task) Resolution. Those have lit a path for me that I think will make my next 4e game (whenever that happens) very much a story-game. Doing something (anything) to speed up the resolution of a combat would help too. It's that whole Bass analogy that Iago points out. Very true.<br/><br/>The problem is that a lot of those things fall into the "not against the rules, but not really part of them" category. And because 4e is so rules-heavy in parts, I think it overshadows the potential that's there for "rulings, not rules". 3e had the same problems, for me, as a player and a DM.<br/><br/>4e could really use some material on how to optimally play it with various dials turned up and down. Not even really house-rules. But how you can take the existing rules and employ strategies to get the best bang for your buck. <a href="http://www.onebadegg.com/egg" rel="nofollow">One Bad Egg</a> has made headway in this direction.

Knowing that I was never going to get several combats to fit into one session, I altered a few of the rules that encouraged multiple combats per day.  The PCs seldom fought more than twice per day.  Really, the game played like pretty much exactly like D&amp;D 3.5, with the notable exception that combats were more than just button-mashing "I attack." sequences.  We had just as much of a mildly-contrived fantasy story with investigation, arguments, and roleplaying as we ever did.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, Dungeons and Dragons has always been a freeform roleplaying game with a fun tactical combat engine.

D&amp;D doesn't offer more or new tools for the role-playing part, so that's not what people tend to focus on when trying it.  The observation I made after a couple games when another player was complaining about the perceived lack of RP was "hmm. Well, D&amp;D doesn't require that element to work, as a system. But we do, as players. So we'll do it."  That didn't satisfy him immediately, but it did once we put that into practice.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206292/#Comment_206292" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T10:19:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 10:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ryan said.<br/><br/>Also, maybe a bunch of storygamer types play 4E once or twice, never in campaign, never the same character thrice, and never really get into the groove. I know that I spent my first four games or so mastering the rules and my character. We did some rapid advancement stuff (jumping from 1st level to 4th to 8th to 10th between sessions) and I found I didn't know my character's abilities well.<br/><br/>If I had played the game as intended, leveled up slowly, played each level for ten encounters or so, and slowly built up my abilities, I would have been way more comfortable in encounters. <br/><br/>Relevance? Without mastery of your character, combats take a lot longer. That 4-hour session is 30 minutes of gabbing, 3 hours of fighting, and maybe 30 minutes of role-playing.<br/><br/>Also, the new is shiny. You have these cool powers and want to try them out. If you're done with the game before you've mastered them, you never get to the point where you can comfortably ignore the powers a bit and lean back and enjoy the scenery.<br/><br/>My point is to people who feel 4E is very much JUST a tactical game, have you played the same character for 3-4 sessions in a row? That's about the "soft spot" I found when playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206310/#Comment_206310" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T11:13:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 11:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As others said upthread, I think people who hang out at Story Games are probably predisposed toward playing D&amp;D 4e as a board game. If we were looking for something more story-oriented, we'd probably pick up a game other than D&amp;D. That was true in the days of 3e too, incidentally.<br/><br/>That said, I think there are lots and lots of people out there without our biases who happily use 4e for deep, story-oriented gaming. As an example, check out the <a href="http://northmoor.spookyouthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Return to Northmoor</a> podcast (and it's cool to boot). <br/><br/>I think it's important to note that 4e is the latest in a long line of RPGs (including all previous editions of D&amp;D) that had very little in the way of rules-based support for talking in funny voices and generating story. In many ways, 4e gives more support for that stuff than previous editions between the text dedicated to personality, mannerisms, appearance and background at the beginning of the Player's Handbook, the Skill Challenges (which at least make an attempt to create a framework for social situations beyond a simple skill check), and a fair bit of advice in the DMG dedicated to creating setting, adventures and campaigns filled with story.<br/><br/>It's true that 4e can be played as a very robust tactical board game. But I think we're being myopic if we assume that's all there is to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206535/#Comment_206535" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T03:53:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  3:53AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Well said, Thor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9238/do-you-play-4th-edition-like-a-tactical-boardgame" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9238/do-you-play-4th-edition-like-a-tactical-boardgame" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9238/do-you-play-4th-edition-like-a-tactical-boardgame/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9238%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9238%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
