I've made two games that basically hinge on that single mechanic. Have a gauge that affects effectiveness. Have other players and/or GM make offers for doing bad things. If they accept and do it, they get the points. If they refuse, they have to pay as many points. As such:<br/><br/>P1: "I give you two dice if you kill them! Kill them all!"<br/>P2: "Oh, uh, fuck. No, I'm not gonna do that" (Pays two dice)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>P1: "I give you two dice if you kill them! Kill them all!"<br/>P2: "Damnit, ok. I'll do it. I kill them all." (Recieves two dice)<br/><br/>This sort of mechanic gives instant bangs and makes for a game where it's really hard to stay on the good side and still get somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376075/#Comment_376075" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T23:33:49+00:00" title="May  2, 2012 11:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, so you're makin' your game, that all sounds good.

Is going nuts/ regaining sanity/ Become corrupted a valid goal in your game or just something that should keep players away from reaching their goals inmediatly? Depending on that, perhaps you don't need to make it more interesting than having players choose one mental illness from a list when their "will save" fails or a sanity counter reaches zero. <br/><br/>On the other hand you could use a lot of tricks to represent madness/ sanity/ corruption by changing the procedures in the game. For example, start making up hallucinations when they fail a perception roll, have them use a different skill or power instead of the one they choose, introduce them to a conflict and without resolving it jump to a scene in a bar five hours later, have a couple of players wounded and picture them all laughing silly except that now they realize nobody knows who told the last joke, what are they celebrating or how the heck did they ended up there.<br/><br/>You see, it also depends on what kind of madness you're trying to emulate. You can have players act it out or have the enviroment push it into the character's perception. In Don't Rest your Head madness goes as far as becoming the enviroment through a sort of metaphor of the PCs issues. I still sorta want to run it using <a href="http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a><br/><br/>I'd go for the list but instead of just telling the player to roleplay his character with paranoia, the list would include specific symptoms and the GM would have to feed those. Like when "hearing voices" I usually give the player two different advice. Both could sound good but acting on one of them could get the character in trouble... cool thing is that I don't use it too much, but the players keep asking me "What do the voices say to me?" which always feels completely lunatic from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376354/#Comment_376354" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T06:47:51+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  6:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gtroc</cite>Also I like the idea of a tipping point. a point past which the corruption no longer gives a benefit. this leads people to want to ride that narrow margin of greatest benefit prior to falling to corruption.</blockquote>\nI dunno - a lot of 'successful' people seem pretty sociopathic to me.

A tipping point adds a more interesting mechanic as it makes people want to ride that thin line. If the corruption mechanic just gave benefits for it, or just negatives then the game is very standard. The players would try to gain or avoid corruption respectively. to give it an upside, and then to swing that around is a fun fiddly mechanic. Games do not represent real life. They only represent life in so much as it is interesting as a game. Beyond that life should be ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I am uncertain if "sociopathic" is the correct term. Most sociopaths are incapable of functioning in society on a high enough level to gain fame, riches, or what have you. Most "successful" people are very driven and selfish/self centered, but that is not the same thing. Sorry, broke into semantics there for a second.

Being a bit corrupt will help a little.  Being a lot corrupt will help a lot.  Sounds a bit like being a politician, doesn't it?

(Probably not, it will give you brain damage.)  But it is also really good.  There is an actual human person at the table offering you dice and explaining and justifying why you should do something bad in a very particularly bad way.  It is as close to how actual bribery and corruption works as any game has ever gotten.<br><br/>But let's back up.<br/><br/>Loss of sanity, as normally expressed through a Lovecraftian lens, not really corruption, though he may have described it that way.  Corruption is a <i>logical</i> thing that <i>makes sense.</i>  Madness and insanity is the opposite of corruption because it focuses you internally rather than giving you leverage over your environment.<br/><br/>Virtually 100 percent of people will be a little corrupt if they think they won't get caught, and if they don't get caught being a little corrupt, most will push it farther.  Corruption is really the same as <i>courage</i> - you have to be incredibly bold and brazen in order to grab off a nice chunk for yourself.<br/><br/>I would make your corruption mechanic to where the higher your willpower or courage, the more corrupt you can be, and vice versa, at least in an environment where corruption might be caught or punished.  If you're easily pushed around or bullied, you will only ever be a tiny bit corrupt.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376623/#Comment_376623" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T16:13:33+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  4:13PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Levi KornelsenHere's a fun one:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a black (or grey, or whatever suits corruption in your setting/game/thing) die. You roll it with all your rolls, but it never counts. You can make it count, replacing or adding to whatever else you rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make it count, you have to describe how you are being cruel, or inhuman, or whatever-corruption-means.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do that, you gain a corruption point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the points add up, they change you in (way).<br/>\n<br/>\n(Way) can include "your descriptions must bethisextreme to benefit."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pretty good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nRiffing on this: The corruption points could be added in to rolls that had to do with madness. You still roll all three dice and ignore the odd one out, but when trying to resist something to do with madness, you would have to add your corruption bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, let's say you're rolling 3d6 (with one die being the odd-colored one.) You want to roll low to resist madness effects. But you add in the corruption points you've built up so far to every madness roll. (Actually, on a 2d6 bell curve, +2 can be a pretty devastating change. I think it goes something like +1, +2, +6, +10 for degrees of likelihood modification. When working with a 2d6 bell curve, I usually striate the target numbers as 2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12+ or 12-14, 16-17, 18+)<br/>\n<br/>\nMadness situations might be things where you had to appear normal or interact with society - in fact, that's what they should be because the only yardstick for sanity is whether or not society accepts your behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376627/#Comment_376627" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T17:06:35+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  5:06PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You seem like you are doing great in this, but I wanted to point at the corruption mechanics in the Burning Wheel magic book.

But if you really care about the fiction, then in-fiction consequences will make you hesitate. If you really don't want to kill that dude, then having a game that gives you a mechanical bonus if you kill him is going to make it a Tough Choice (TM).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377070/#Comment_377070" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T20:27:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  8:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This whole mechanic thing kind of reminds of In Nomine (speaking of back in the day.) <br>\n<br>\nSo why not take a page from that? <br>\nCorruption could make you stand out in public more, making it more likely that normal people would react negatively and things that prey on corruption would pick you out of a crowd.
