The schedule for games will be at the Ashcan Front booth, but we ask that anyone interested sign up at the GoD room.  We hope that this gets people to stick around after signing up and finding some other awesome games to play, too.<br/><br/>Also, when you go to sign up, I am working on a way to mark Ashcan Front signup sheets a special Ashcan Front symbol, but I am still investigating this as a possibility.<br/><br/>I am going to let each Ashcan Front member discuss their games on this thread and post the times they are going to be running.  As a member of the Ashcan Front booth, I will be following this with a second post listing my times and games.<br/><br/>This is not an official event like the Indie Games Explosion, merely a good, central place we can meet to playtest our games.  So we hope that many of your out there in Story Games land will stop by and check out our games!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160947/#Comment_160947" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T22:08:08+00:00" title="August  5, 2008 10:08PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will be running two games in the GoD room: <i>Messiah</i> my Ashcan Front game.  Messiah is basically a game where the Messiah has come back to remake the world, you're just hoping the Messiah remakes the world in your image.  It is a a roleplaying/strategy hybrid and is GMless, competitive, and usually either provokes thought or laughter.  Sometimes both.<br/><br/>I am runnig <i>Messiah</i>:<br/>2:00-3:00 Friday<br/>3:00-4:00 Saturday<br/><br/>The games will be short, but will still show off the game.  I will also have give aways for anyone who plays in the game.<br/><br/>I am also running <i>Mecha</i> my ultimate game of mecha anime badassery in the GoD room on Saturday from 4-6.  I would like 2-3 more players for anyone who would like to play.  The setting is military mecha, 008th MS Team/Code Geass style.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
