It is highly probably I created something way too bizarre to be functional.  The dice mechanic I'm using is as follows:<br/>Players roll 2d6.  1d6 is for their Presence, the other d6 is for the Power they apply to the situation.  The outcome schematic looks as follows:<br/>Presence roll:<br/>1-2 = Manifest your presence.  All eyes on you.<br/>3-4 = Minimize your presence.  There is evidence of your tampering.<br/>5-6 = Mask your presence.<br/><br/>Power roll:<br/>1-2 = Your power is not felt/observed.<br/>3-4 = Your power is noted; it's effects fall short of your expectations.<br/>5-6 = Your power overwhelms and is acknowledged by all.<br/><br/>The idea is, truly stealthy actions require Finesse: very minimal presence and precise application of just the right amount of power.  i.e. 5-6 on Presence and 1-2 on Power.<br/>Similarly, truly overt actions are more concerned with presenting Force: Very high power with a maximized presence to cow the opposition into submission.  i.e. 5-6 on Power and 1-2 on Presence.<br/>Given this outcome scheme, I'm wondering if I can bypass the entire success/failure paradigm and simply stick to the narrative imposed by the dice.  Since each die gives you a narrative "look" for how the action proceeds, I've found it is possible to know exactly what aspect of the task the character was able/unable to accomplish.<br/><br/>Consider the following example:<br/>James wants to bluster and cajole the customs agent to convince them not to search his vessel full of stolen goods.  This is an application of power over subtlety.  Thus, to truly succeed, he wants to verbally demonstrate that he is a force to reckon with (high power) and also use his body language to display arrogant impatience and practiced annoyance (high presence).<br/>James rolls a 5 for Power and a 5 for Presence.  Now, his words have the cutting edge and technical jargon needed to cow the customs agent on an intellectual level.  But his presence is lacking.  He doesn't display the body language of physical dominance he'd like to; masked presence: the gesticulation he employed didn't convey the raw physicality he would have liked or the practiced manner of someone bored of dealing with bureaucratic functionaries.<br/><br/>See, this is not necessarily success or failure in the standard sense of: his action went through or it did not.  To some extent, it was successful, he knew all the right jargon and phrases necessary to cajole and fluster the customs agent.  At the same time, his outward appearance is much calmer and more reserved than what the customs agent would expect from a person of the station he's pretending to be.  I'd call this a neutral result.  The agent will stall for time, but no real resolution has been achieved, the scene carries on.  <br/><br/>At any rate, all this rambling is to say, do we really need success and failure as the end all be all bench-mark?  I know other systems have expanded this definition to include partial failures/successes.  But I'm wondering if the whole system can be circumvented to only have: "This is your new narrative, act accordingly."  I think the success/failure paradigm is implicit in that kind of outcome method.  After all, if you didn't roll up the narrative outcome you were looking for it is a failure of sorts.  Still at that point, am I not just trying to call a spade a shovel?  I mean, sure they are very similar in function, but one of em looks different.  From a practical application point of view, they both handle the same activity (more or less), so why try and get all fancy when you don't need to. Honestly, by any definition, the above example is very rightly categorized as a partial success or a partial failure.  Not so extreme in either direction to end the scene, but certainly enough to add further complication to the issue at hand.  I just don't know.  Any thoughts on if a dice mechanic like this could work?  I'm envisioning something that only directs the flow of narrative, but doesn't make any hard value statements of success or failure.  Of course, without the possibility of failure, who gives a damn.  Sigh.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443655/#Comment_443655" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T13:09:57+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  1:09PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that what you're discussing here is a task resolution system with organic conflict resolution embedded in the narration in the form of oracular automatic writing. It is possible and functional, and has a proud history in roleplaying. Understanding how it works is central to understanding how a traditional roleplaying game works, I'd say.<br/><br/>You're still resolving success, it's just that you're pushing the resolution up from the dice and into the hands of whoever narrates the outcomes of action. This method is one of the staples of railroading play ("you fail your climb check, but manage to grab the ledge before you fall"), but it can be used for different purposes as well. If you provide the narrator with some guidelines for how to resolve things, they can do the conflict resolution for you.<br/><br/>A simpler example of a similar set-up, without the oracular element: when a character tries to do something, you roll [skill]+d6 against a difficulty number determined by how difficult the action is. This mandates whether the character succeeds in a given action. However, in addition to this the GM has a secret plot track that tells him whether the party is currently in a "down" or "up" phase of the story. If they are in a "down" phase, successes rolled for characters in task resolution ultimately come to impact the situation only in minor ways as new complications occur or the chosen concrete actions prove unnecessary or even harmful to their cause. In an "up" phase this is reversed; failed actions fail in ways that show new opportunities, or there's time to retry them.<br/><br/>The key to understanding here is that task resolution (does the character succeed in doing a thing they are trying to do) and conflict resolution (does the character get the outcome they wanted) are independent factors of design. Conflating them has traditionally caused much confusion, because pretending that conflict resolution does not exist means that the <i>impact</i> of successful or failed action is up for grabs - whoever gets to contextualize the successful action gets to decide whether that action ultimately matters at all.<br/><br/>Thus, my answer to your question: it is possible to resolve tasks and conflicts in various ways, not all of them involving dice. I am less certain as to whether it is possible to "skip" either entirely if the game purports to produce intelligible narratives about people doing things. Somebody at some point decides whether the climb check succeeds, and somebody at some point decides whether that success or failure matters.<br/><br/>The system you describe avoids absolute determination of success, but somebody is still deciding whether the outcome was appropriate to the situation. That person is effectively using the dice as an oracular aid in composing their narrative. It is a very different feel for a game, so I'm not trying to say that it's trivial - but it is still resolving success.<br/><br/>To further illustrate the point, consider a system where we draw a Tarot card every time a character tries something, and the GM then interprets the card to narrate how successful the character was. You're doing the same thing here, except you're using a couple of tables and dice instead of a card, and your oracle is more focused and less symbolic in nature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443657/#Comment_443657" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T13:22:53+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  1:22PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2015 1:23PM by kksimons.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, whether the result of the dice themselves determine success or failure is one thing, but it's going to be determined by someone at some point. I hear <i>Swords Without Master</i> often getting touted as an RPG without a conflict resolution mechanic (because the dice are used to set tone of narration and plot twists and such rather than success or failure) but the person narrating is still determining success or failure and just taking their cue from the dice rather than leaving the dice to determine it. (I love the game if that sounded in any way like a bad thing by the way). <br/><br/>I can't imagine an RPG that leaves any points of tension or conflict by the wayside, which I guess it'd have to do for there not to be any resolution for it, but there might be one around?

Like, if you try to kill the town mayor, a black die might mean that you succeed at your task, but now you're a wanted criminal who has to dispose of a body.  Or perhaps a white die means that you fail because the mayor isn't there, but you uncover stacks of bearer bonds that you can steal.  The system doesn't care if you succeed at your task or not, only whether or not the scene works out well for you.

I am not clear on exactly <i>why</i> you want to do this, but I can imagine plenty of good reasons, so I'll move on to your rules idea.<br/><br/>The important bits I see are these:<br/><br/>- Success isn't binary yes/no.  The range of outcomes is as broad as interpretations of the fiction.  As is, a lot of responsibility lies with the interpreter, and narrating the outcomes of middling rolls could feel like GM fiat.  With stronger guidelines about how to interpret rolls, the fiat feeling would diminish, but the feeling of "regular old roll for success, just with degrees" would increase.<br/><br/>- The outcome-narrator has two axes of performance by which to compare what the character did to both their goal and the situation.  Nice!  This should provide inspiration and prevent "drawing a blank".<br/><br/>- Whatever happens is a result of character performance, not opponent performance or other in-fiction factors.  "Roll to see how well you perform" is not new, but it is distinct from other types of success rolls.  The specificity of the two-axis roll also means that we know something about your performance, even if you never roleplay it out.<br/><br/>Is this what you're going for?  If so, then well done!  if not, then what <i>are</i> you going for?\n<blockquote>I'm wondering if the whole system can be circumvented to only have: "This is your new narrative, act accordingly."</blockquote>If that's what you want, then your trigger for rolling needs to be something other than "does this character achieve what they're attempting right now".  Roll every time a player speaks, or at the beginnings of scenes, or every five minutes, or when play slows down, or something.  And then, when a character tries to do something important that might or might not work, you'll need to deal with that in some way that doesn't highlight "so does it work?" above the rest of play.  Do you actually want that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443728/#Comment_443728" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T17:44:30+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  5:44PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trigger point is <i>very</i> important to note.

I was definitely not aware of how many systems bypass the success-failure metric.  Beyond that, it never occurred to me to make the end goal narration rights, I think that's actually a very interesting approach to the idea of randomized resolution.  I haven't checked out Houses of the Blooded, but I think I should go find a copy to see how a system like that can be implemented.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> Imagine looks like a very neat game.  I'm actually gonna try that out this weekend, very slick.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>  Thank you so much for breaking the situation down for me.  That really put into perspective what I was doing with that outcome table.  \n<blockquote>I think that what you're discussing here is a task resolution system with organic conflict resolution embedded in the narration in the form of oracular automatic writing. <br/><br/>The system you describe avoids absolute determination of success, but somebody is still deciding whether the outcome was appropriate to the situation. That person is effectively using the dice as an oracular aid in composing their narrative. It is a very different feel for a game, so I'm not trying to say that it's trivial - but it is still resolving success.<br/><br/>To further illustrate the point, consider a system where we draw a Tarot card every time a character tries something, and the GM then interprets the card to narrate how successful the character was. You're doing the same thing here, except you're using a couple of tables and dice instead of a card, and your oracle is more focused and less symbolic in nature.</blockquote>\nThese three sections really helped me come to grips with what I was attempting.  When I created the outcome table, I honestly had no idea what I was really doing, I just knew that I liked it because it felt different from any game I'd played thus far.  However, after having reviewed all these posts, I think my biggest conclusion is that my oracular elements are lacking.  If I'm trying to embed the conflict resolution into the oracular aid of the dice, those oracular elements need to be a bit more... descriptive.  After all, what does it mean to get high power and low presence when data-mining a spreadsheet for fraudulent tax information?  I know how I would interpret that kind of roll, but my worry was that no other GM in the world would, and it would become a guessing game where the GM just decides, um yea, here, this happens.  Most players just want to know, did I get the target number or not.  But at the end of the day, I've left most narrative control in the hands of the GM to arbitrate the final outcome. However, if I lean into the oracular element, define a few catch-all variables that can encompass most every situation, then I think narrative control doesn't have to so strictly be left up to the GM.  Everyone should be able to look at the dice and see what some of the possible "mixed succeess/failure" outcomes may result in X situation.  Which I think would make for a more fun game with players getting to tell the tale of how things just don't quite go their way.  I lose the simplicity of defining all actions by presence and power, but I think in this kind of dice mechanic, clarity might be the better end of the spectrum to skew for.\n<blockquote>One thing that might happen with your rules as written is that players might adjust their narrative/plans based on the dice results.  If James wants to cajole the guard, but rolls low on power and high on presence, he might narrate that he tries to get what he wants but in a different way.  But that might be a side-effect you like.</blockquote>\nThis is one thing I've been a bit wary of, and honestly I'm not sure how I want to handle it.  I'm hoping by focusing my outcome scheme to be less broad people can see how ok, maybe they did change their approach mid performance but even that caries it's own consequences.  If that is the end result, then I'm totally fine with it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443732/#Comment_443732" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T18:00:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  6:00PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One note: Swords Without Master manages a unique style of dice resolution by placing <i>limits on the fiction</i>.

If failure doesn't matter, no roll is needed, it's an automatic success.  Does that seem like an appropriate trigger?  I've always hated the concept of "roll for everything you have a stat for."

A roll to determine performance.  But like i said above, and you pointed out as well, without a more focused definition of outcome it did feel like the middling results were more GM Fiat than any kind of decisive performance metric.  Finally, no, I probably don't want the last situation you were talking about.  When I was struggling to make sense of the table I built, I began to wonder if I could just make the dice a tool for pushing performance, but even then I'd force it to only come into play when the shape of that performance is in question because of outside factors that throw the outcome into question.  All this to say, it seems like a way too complicated system to successfully implement without bogging down my game as written.<br/><br/>For the sake of people following this thread, I decided to focus the results by defining a few variables controlled by both Power and Presence.<br/>Presence determines your:<br/>Visibility, Focus/Concentration, Reproducibility of Action, and Body Language.  <br/>Power determines your: <br/>Decibel of Action (Loudness and Raw Power), Verbal Quality (Subtle Language vs. Domineering Language), and Accuracy.  <br/>The end result is that my outcome table looks like this now:<br/><br/>Presence:<br/>1-2 = High Visibility, Easily Reproducible, Unfocused, Overt Body Language.<br/>3-4 = Low Visibility, Difficult to Reproduce, Distracted, Notable Body Language.<br/>5-6 = Minimal Visibility, Cannot Reproduce, High Focus, Subtle Body Language.<br/><br/>Power:<br/>1-2 = Low Decibel, Subtle Language, High Accuracy.<br/>3-4 = Medium Decibel, Hesitating/Halting Language, Variable Accuracy.<br/>5-6 = High Decibel, Impressive/Domineering Language, Low Accuracy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443734/#Comment_443734" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T18:15:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  6:15PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2015 8:26PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>if I lean into the oracular element, define a few catch-all variables that can encompass most every situation, then I think narrative control doesn't have to so strictly be left up to the GM.

The total dictated success or failure (which you could easily replace with a spectrum), the white die reflected the player character's performance, the black die reflected the opponent's performance, and the red die reflected the environment's contribution.  I think narration was left up to the rolling player, but I can also see how it could be split up (player white, GM black, anyone else red).<br/><br/>2) Break situations into a few types, so not every roll has to include covering every base.  Five different rolls with three dice each is probably better than one type of roll with 15 dice (well, not that there wouldn't be overlap, but you get my point).<br/><br/>Brainstorm:<br/><br/>Seduction/Manipulation dice: transparency, charm, impression of value<br/>Intimidation dice: power, urgency, savagery<br/>Assessment dice: senses, intuition, reason<br/>Combat dice: power, speed, training<br/>Stealth dice: agility, timing, notice<br/><br/>I feel like I'd know what to do with high and low values on those.<br/><br/><b>Edited to add:</b> Not that Presence and Power aren't cool!  I do like those.  But if you wind up wanting roll outputs beyond Visibility, Focus/Concentration, Reproducibility of Action, Body Language, Decibel of Action, Verbal Quality, and Accuracy (or if you don't want to tie them to each other -- e.g. if you want "Highly Visible + Highly Focused" to be possible), these might help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443736/#Comment_443736" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T19:04:32+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  7:04PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2015 7:18PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Carpe">@Carpe</a> and David  I see what you're saying about the trigger point.

Notice how your description above still relies on success/failure to frame a roll--if failure isn't meaningful, there's no roll. What if you completely disregarded success/failure altogether for your trigger? What sorts of situations emerge then?<br/><br/>For example, maybe the trigger is "When you prepare to draw your power into the world, roll the dice". The player can then trigger it when appropriate. You'd also probably have to have some way to adjucate what happens in situations that don't use the character's power. Ultimately, that seems like a sort of game that's all about watching a more-than-human character in a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" rel="nofollow">world of cardboard</a>.<br/><br/>So, this veers from your design a bit, but here's a rough draft of what that could look like.<br/><br/><b>Steps of Immortals</b><br/>You are superhuman beings, immortals infused with great power.<br/><br/><i>Character Creation:</i> choose your True Name, the Mortal Name you go by, your Domain (how your power manifests, it can be concrete or abstract, such as "Dreams", "Love", "Animals", or "Technology"), and finally the Immortal Question: <b>"Why do you not claimed the mortal world as your possession?"</b><br/><br/><i>Mechanics:</i> for the time being, I'll skim over most of the gameplay bits, they could use multiple models.

In forcing me to think outside that paradigm, I think you've convinced me of two things: 1) Success/failure is an integral, core aspect of my game.  So I should just embrace that. Given the kind of stories I'm trying to tell with this game, it all hinges on a character's intent.  Their very choices in how to approach each problem is where the pivotal moments are.  Since that is the case, the game has to be about success/failure.  2) I think I need to approach this as, you succeed or fail in attempting to solve this conundrum with subtlety or force, but this is how that happened.  I should make it very explicit that these are good and bad outcomes.  Rather than just imply the die narrative will guide your thought process, I should clearly spell out: This is failure when approaching a task with subtlety.  This is success when approaching a task with brute force.  Now that you know good and bad, the die will suggest what the actual act looked like.<br/><br/>Of course, this brings me to my next question.  By retaining the "Die tell you your performance" aspect of this outcome scheme am I confabulating the system? On the one hand, it is a game that is very objective and goal oriented.  And yet, the die are telling you about the performance of the action. Even if I make clear cut definitions of success and failure, wouldn't having this second axis that only defines the narrative of the action, blur the focus away from success/failure? Ideally, I would like this to work as two parallel systems.  Raw numbers telling you success and failure.  And then the numbers can be correlated to the cinematic descriptor of how the action played out.  You didn't just fail to sneak by the guard. Because you rolled too high on Power you tipped over a can and caused a lot of noise OR you rolled low Presence: you were quiet, but distracted by the laser grid strobing the room so you ran right into a guard who was walking around the corner.  Ordinarily, this would be the kind of thing handled by the GM, I'm trying to just give them a bit more direction on some of the kinds of ways failure and success can look like.  Still, after this whole discussion and the revelation that my very core conceit hinges on success/failure, I wonder if having this second parallel system confuses the theme of the game.<br/><br/>Edit: <a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a>: I'm not against the ideas you proposed in that brainstorming bit, only problem is I'm trying to make this a one-page microsystem, so I'm not sure I could do something so detailed to cover all facets.  That having been said, I'm still mulling it over, trying to find a way to incorporate it, because I quite liked that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443756/#Comment_443756" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T02:37:36+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  2:37AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two thoughts, very quickly:<br/><br/>1.

Then the two dice are rolled.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could outline a few different possible arenas where rolls could be important: In Stealthy Pursuits, With Steel and Blood, To Sway Others, that kind of thing, and define two Factors for each beforehand. "To Sway Others, Presence and Power are the most important Factors."<br/><br/>2.

The text makes point of the idea that the facts of this cost (a level of damage) should be the same regardless of what's happening in the fiction, leaving the broader outcomes to flow from the existing circumstances (for the PC in the example, it's a relatively minor inconvenience; if his suit had already been at a critical damage level, he'd be dead). <br/><br/>So success or failure then comes down to the players' evaluation of the possible costs, not the die roll. I should note that managing dwindling resources is a key concern in <i>UED</i>.<br/><br/>Now, this is arguably just a reframing of pass/fail + fail forward, but I think it's still an interesting recasting of what the task roll means to the players. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443763/#Comment_443763" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T07:19:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  7:19AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2015 7:30AM by Luzelli.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I'll try to make this short.<br/>I've worked up a second version that splits the difference between rolling for narrative control and rolling for success.<br/>Players roll their die.

The players use the remaining 3 variables to describe whatever part of that axis was left out.<br/><br/>Finally, every two increments on the die modify these variables.  So a 1-2 on Presence would say Maximum Visibility (everyone can see you) while a 3-4 would say Low visibility (A couple people might spot you).  Depending on the numbers rolled, the players would pick from variables that have this high, medium, low qualifier and use them to describe either success/failure or complication.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> If polaris is the game that won Game Chef, then yes I've heard of it, but never looked at it myself.

Also, bidding for the fate of the outcome sounds super rad.  If you don't use it, I'll totally steal it.

Of course you know best for your project, and I'm glad you're rejecting the stuff that doesn't fit.  Maybe you'll come back to your success/failure paradigm thoughts later for a more open-ended project and have a different set of options.  I think it's a neat topic!<br/><br/>Regarding confabulation: <br/><br/>Once you get people on board to focus on goals and objectives, I think you're fine.  Just because a game is primarily about objectives and goals doesn't mean it can't also feature fictional embellishments.  If the process of resolving narrative elements was too intrusive, then yeah, you might have a problem, but it isn't.  It's a quick look at two dice, and an intuitive parsing of that, with very little at stake in the parsing.  Right?  If so, players will only devote as much time and energy to it as they really want to.<br/><br/>The only risk I see is one of presentation.  If it's a one-page game, and a large chunk of it is about a system for establishing narrative elements, and you don't have room for orientation text and are just letting the rules speak for themselves, then yeah, people could get the wrong idea.  If you can find a way to get your priorities and hierarchies across, though, I'd guess you'll be fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
