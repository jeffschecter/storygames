In fact, this is the safest option for a GM to offer her players, and even if the GM is running a \u201cgrowthless\u201d campaign, this approach should be strongly considered for use.<br/><br/>At the end of every session, the GM may offer her players the option to shuffle their sheets around a little. This means the players may do one or more of the following (but not one of the things listed twice or more), all subject to approval:<br/><br/>    * Swap out one aspect for another<br/>    * Swap out an Average (lowest rung) skill for another not currently in the pyramid, or, change the places of two skills in the pyramid that are not more than one rung apart from each other.<br/>    * Drop a stunt that hasn\u2019t seen much use, and pick up a new one.<br/><br/>The idea behind this is that characters, even if they don\u2019t grow in power or necessarily deepen in story, still change over time. Lessons are learned. Some abilities fall out of practice, while others come to the fore. This technique helps cover that, and can give players a real feeling of their characters not being the same-old-same-old they started out with on day one.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186159/#Comment_186159" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T22:03:35+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 10:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Sands</cite>I thought there was the possibility of changing them in Spirit of the Century?

If it came up organically through play that'd be niftier.<br/><br/>That is neat.  Trait votes are one of the coolest parts of BW, without a doubt.<br/><br/>Honestly, my problem with this might very well be solved by just going with less aspects.  Ten makes me want to fiddle with them.  Having five makes it all tighter.<br/><br/>Imagine super-heroes with those five aspects, the five pillars of those character's existence.<br/><br/>Superman:<br/><br/>Kryptonian Birth<br/>Kansas Farm-Boy in the Big City Secret I.D.<br/>Powers from the Yellow Sun<br/>Kryptonite Weakness<br/>Fortress of Solitude<br/><br/>Those are solid pillars.  I am not sure I would want to change any of those.<br/><br/>So, maybe my problem with aspects not changing is just a numbers game and cutting them down from 10 to 5 would do it to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186167/#Comment_186167" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T22:56:43+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 10:56PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have also found reducing the number makes the whole thing much more manageable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186189/#Comment_186189" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T05:22:13+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  5:22AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, but Judd!
