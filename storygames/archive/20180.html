Why have you heard of it? Why did it catch your interest?<br/><br/>I'm mostly asking this because of what <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> wrote in <a href="http://daytrippersrpg.com/forums/rules-rulings/rulings-not-rules" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>.<br/><br/>I'm also asking myself so I can realize, and start to look at, these things from a different perspective.

For roleplayers, I'd say that something like 15% are more or less primarily oriented towards Nordic freeform as their primary style. Similar numbers as you'd get for Forge-oriented proge gamers, pretty much. Another, somewhat smaller slice seems to prioritize OSR gaming nowadays, and the rest are unreconstructed trad/mainstream gamers and/or WotC consumers, I guess. Numbers courtesy of my ass, of course <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I agree with your actual point, though - it's totally feasible to be gaming around here without caring a whit about auteurism, larping, immersionism, jeepform or any of that stuff. I do it myself, really - despite having a pretty intense history with the hobby, I've never really gotten into the Nordic stuff; it's pretty far away from my actual interests, it's more likely to see me playing Warhammer than sitting in a closet getting into touch with my feelings <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445279/#Comment_445279" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-20T12:19:42+00:00" title="May 20, 2015 12:19PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hugely influenced.

With my regular group it was GURPS. Always.<br/>It has to be said, though, that for many years I was very much against pretty much anything new. Couldn't see the point. Railed against Fastaval games that were suddenly written as free-form (before that was a term). Railed against games written with semi-live in mind. And the irony was that they just formalised what I myself had been doing for years. Don't know the rules? Forget them or flip a coin. Hey, it feels more natural to play out this scene. Let's do that.<br/>A few years ago, I decided to try something new. I'd choose a random jeepform game and play it with an open mind. And it was glorious! (Resan).<br/>After that, I became more open to novel experiences, and I began to see games with rules we didn't <i>have</i> to ignore to play the game we wanted. Where we didn't need to mutilate the rules to support the fiction, but where the rules work! They <i>help</i>!<br/>I will admit that I've passed on the more complex systems. While I adore what Dogs in the Vineyard does, and I love the world, the system is too complex for my tired brain. That's why I'm mainly stuck on Apocalypse World hacks involving monsters and PrimeTime Adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445403/#Comment_445403" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-29T14:40:13+00:00" title="May 29, 2015  2:40PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my contact with Nordic stuff ( the more experimental kind) is very much at a distance, through discussions here mostly. I can think of a couple of aspects that made my ears perk up.<br/><br/><b>1) It doesn't always have to be geared towards commercialism to count as success</b><br/>I loved discussions at The Forge when it existed, but a lot of that was geared towards turning your game idea into a viable product as a major goal. Nordic scene seems more geared towards getting the thing to a functional stage, then hitting a con and having people play it when you put it on. Big success there is in people talking about the experience and getting a rep as a scenario/game designer and runner-of-game. That's pretty damn cool to me.<br/><br/><b>2) The scenario <i>is</i> the game</b><br/>Even though techniques are refined and borrowed from scenario to scenario, the goal isn't to build a core system and then tack on scenarios to it. Each scenario is a game is a specific event, and the build ( your combination of mechanics choices as a designer) is made with that specific game in mind. Holy Hannah, that mentality opens up a ton of options!<br/><br/><b>3) A lot of it seems geared towards producing a unique one time experience</b><br/>The scenario-game might be played by another group of players and another GM, but the experience for a specific group is all their own. It isn't part of campaign play, and never expected to be such. Again, opens up new design possibilities.<br/><br/><b>4) With all of that stuff, and designing for a short playtime, you can ( and should) cut out lots of mechanical cruft</b> <br/><br/><b>5)As a one-shot, you can develop a mentality of really playing things to the hilt among participants</b><br/><br/><b>6) As a one-shot, you can really focus in to a very specific situation/set up/cast of characters</b><br/><br/>Oh geez, just a whole bunch of stuff has been influential on my thinking, even at this long distance and removal from the folks more near the center of this kind of thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445414/#Comment_445414" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-30T15:18:38+00:00" title="May 30, 2015  3:18PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, komradebob.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445446/#Comment_445446" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T07:49:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  7:49AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Komradebob, you really hit the nail on the head.
