For this reason, I can see a fairly significant hack on the horizon. Well, I say that, I'm in the progress of it. But I'd like to open up to the Story Games community and perhaps get some advice or ideas on which direction to go. In theme, mechanics or balance.<br/><br/><b>Psychic Powers</b> -- My current idea is, eschew Psi Points altogether. In order to use a Psychic Power make a Mental Effects/Wisdom save, but use your "Warptie" (Psyker class skill) skill as an additional modifier. After you roll, regardless of success or failure, roll 3d20. If any those dice match their natural result with each other or the original roll (i.e. you roll doubles), roll on the Psychic Phenomena table. You may reduce your Warptie modifier in order to reduce the number of d20s you roll after the original roll, or increase your Warptie modifier to increase the number of d20s you roll after the original roll.<br/><br/>--Now, preferably, I would like to make this a 2d6 roll. Simple, easy. My problem is that I would like to retain the Pushing mechanic (whereby you can reduce your chance of success to reduce the chance of bad things happen or increase your chance of success by increasing the chance of bad things happening) and have an approximately 10% chance that bad things will happen if you don't Push or Pull. Which, as you might imagine, is difficult on a 2d6 roll.<br/><br/><b>Fate and Silent Legions</b> -- Perhaps obviously, I'm borrowing mechanics from Silent Legions, it even has its own section on porting its mechanics to Stars Without Number. Slaughter dice, Madness (I'll get to that), Expertise and the Occult (I'll get to that as well). I'm following the modification to Class Powers it recommends from the three classes. I'm using Expertise (spend to re-roll essentially) renamed Fate. It's distributed completely differently from in Silent Legions. A player starts with a certain number of Fates (determined by their Home World, essentially Backgrounds in SWN). At the start of each session they roll their Emperor's Blessing (again determined by their Home World) to see if they gain a Fate. When they complete a goal, they gain a Fate. When the group completes a "job" they all gain a Fate. A final little mechanic I'm thinking about: every time you reach 0 Fates, you can make a Luck save; success, gain 1 Fate, fail, roll on Psychic Phenomena as if you are the Psyker.<br/><br/>--I'd really like any thoughts on the balance of Fates, their relevance and your opinion on the manner in which they are currently acquired.<br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b> -- Character Creation goes as follows. Choose Home World (Background in SWN). Choose Background (Training Package from SWN). Choose Class (entirely the same). The differences being that first of all, your Home World determines your Fates and also gives you a special trait e.g. When Feral World characters use Primitive Weaponry they roll 2 Slaughter Dice instead of 1. Second of all, your Background is not determined by which Class you chose, that is selected last (but they are still divided into 8 skill, 6 skill and 4 skill) and it gives you your starting equipment. I've tried to balance this by making it so that the "Expert" (8 skill) backgrounds have no Skills that are helpful to Warriors. It is much more narrow in terms of options (there are 8 Home Worlds and 9 Backgrounds). <br/><br/>--Anything, really.<br/><br/><b>Madness, Corruption and Paranoia</b> -- I'm including Madness from Silent Legions. As a mirror to it, I'm including Corruption, which is functionally the same except that the things that make you gain Corruption are slightly different, and you gain Malignancies instead of Deliriums. Also, my own tried and true, precious little horror game mechanic: every time you lose Sanity/gain Madness/etc. as a result of passing a Perception/Int test, gain 1 Paranoia. From then on, every time you pass a Perception test in a stressful situation, I secretly roll a D6. If it is equal to or lower than your Paranoia, I don't tell you the truth. I probably tell you something horrible. In this system, I'm thinking you have to pass a Mental Effects save in order to work out that what you're seeing isn't real.<br/><br/>--I'm the most confident about this. Kevin Crawford seems to think Madness fits in SWN, a mirror of it should not create too much of an issue and my Paranoia mechanic is just great, if I do say so myself.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I'd appreciate any suggestions of adjustments to other mechanics or insertions of mechanics themselves. A major thing on my mind at the moment is the reward system and whether the one for SWN fits with a game of Dark Heresy. Note, not the reward system for the RPG Dark Heresy, that is non-existent essentially, but the reward system for a game about Inquisitorial agents hunting down heretics, cultists and mutants.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
