We know awesomeness, and how to create it. We know that feeling when things just click; when the other players at the table throw a curveball, and we grab their ideas and twist them and make them even better. Or that feeling when the natural twenties just pile up. Or when someone says something just right. Or when the systems click and whir like well-oiled machines.<br/><br/>I'm not looking for that. I would like to hear about that time when you felt you were on the track of something different.<br/><br/>A session where you didn't quite understand what went on, and you're not sure if you've ever felt quite that way again. A game that made you feel like there was <i>something</i> there - something <i>more</i>. A session where you felt like you transcended the boundaries of the role-playing form.<br/><br/>A time when you were role-playing - but it felt different from role-playing.<br/><br/>Before you read the rest of the thread: Stop. Reply after reading this first post, with your own, personal experience and interpretation. This is about those things that are part of our personal journeys.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159032/#Comment_159032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T05:35:53+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  5:35AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 5:36AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're talking about hitting something sublime, yeah?<br/><br/>I'd point to <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24714.0" rel="nofollow">the short game Emily, James, Mark, and I put together at GenCon last year</a>, where we played people we knew, or at least our projections of what their lives were like, as a departure point.  And then we used the "structured freeform" rules I'd been working on (for my <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> game, of all things).  It felt super personal, like I was sharing a strong and unique emotional experience with these three other people, but we were all very comfortable, in a way that I wouldn't have been if it had been a Jeep/larp scenario and I was expected to act things out or "immerse" in ways that aren't instinctual or comfortable for me (yet).  But it felt like, freed from the constraints of most games, we really got to craft something special, something that dice mechanics would have inhibited or made much more crude and less real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159033/#Comment_159033" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T05:38:03+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  5:38AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure what nuances you are going for here.

Suddenly it was clear that the Agents had to stay in Blue City and make things right. It was obvious (I'm not sure how) that they should transform into the characters they'd met earlier in Blue City.<br/><br/>For me, there was something hypnotic in the air, a sense that time had slowed down around the gaming table. It was an intense last half hour...and yet it wasn't intense...it was easy, everything just flowed.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S. Thanks for starting this, Matthijs.

I was sitting down to run Perfect with a new group, and Daniel Wood (icecreamemperor) was there as a player. He sat down and wrote out his character, and his first scene was this cleverly and poetically worked scene where his character blew up a bridge that a parade was to cross. The descriptions of... I think it might have been cherry blossoms settling after the explosion... were phenomenal. It suddenly became clear that he had this notion - this moment - planned out well before he sat down to play. His character had another crime scene during that session. Also good. After the session he told me how the rest of that character's story would have unfolded, had we more time to play.<br/><br/>...I then realized I'd created a game where you could, as a player, craft a very personal story and then <i>use my game</i> as a way of unfurling it and testing its strength.<br/><br/>Several months later I was at Go Play NW, and Paul Tevis sat down to play Perfect. He said something along the lines of, "I've been wanting to play for a while. I have this awesome story line planned out about a dock worker/arsonist." And it was clear that he knew exactly where he wanted to take his scenes, and exactly the kind of opposition he wanted to face. And I was all like, <i>hey, you can do that in this game!</i><br/><br/>So, yeah. I'm really excited by the potential there. You can bring your story to the table, and see what happens when it interacts with the system. In most games and play styles, that seems counter-productive and tsk-tsk'd against.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
