I had to tweak it a little bit since my group isn\u2019t into the whole Wuxia/CrouchingTigger thing. I also added a few more bells and whistles to the original, but it is still wholly Eric\u2019s game down in the Core.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were five players and me the GM. One class for each player, and the ones I have made are : the Barbarian, The Priest, The Mage, the Scoundrel and the Warrior. All based on my memories of the glory DnD days. My players were into character generation quick-like, and we were from that moment enjoying a trip down memory lane. We agreed that we would have a light tone, but that it wasn\u2019t meant to be a joke-game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the characters made, the semi-feudal Europeanish setting made we started out in a tavern/adventurer\u2019s guild. Right away the players enjoyed playing on all the old type of activities, like hitting on barmaids and drinking imaginary mead. For fun this dragged out a bit before they got their quest.<br/>\nThey group then went to Barrelhaven, a small village under threat from orc raiders. Once in the village I explained them one of the Bells I had added to the Red Box. The looking for rumors part of the Dungeon Crawl. What this basically is a part where the characters can trawl the local area looking for either a hard fact (pre-planned information about the dungeon), tales of treasure (adding more treasure to the dungeon), or Rumors and Ledgends (which gives Rumor Tokens that can be traded in for bonuses at a later time).<br/>\nThe highlights here were the Barbarian finding an alternative entrance, the mage finding out about a magic ring that was lost down there ages ago and the Priest learning of the unrestful dead in the area. We went smoothly from this sequence and into the first encounter where the village priest gave them another quest and they were ambushed by five undead Thralls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here was a thing I noticed about mook fights. Against a group of PCs rolling well on their initiative, small groups of mooks have no chance. All the Thralls had time to do was to swarm into the village church and roar a bit before the Barbarian (two very large axes) and the Warrior (sword and shield combo) had turned them into minced meat. On the upside this made the players cocky.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some more carousing, and the party headed into the forest. After a day they came to the dungeon, and made their first foray in. Again small groups of Mooks, 7 then 4 orcs, were made short work of. Still no scratch on the adventurers, I was worried that the tweaks I had added to the RBH had unbalanced it so that it would be no fun.<br/>\nThis was further reinforced when they chewed themselves through 10 goblins with only the scoundrel and the mage taking a hit point each in damage. This fight however triggered a response from the remaining goblins in that part of the dungeon. Being rushed by twenty or so goblins the party decided to retreat to an arena where they could negate the small weapon advantage that the Goblins held in the Tight arena of the dungeon passage. And then things began to go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mage wanted to fling spells and then run at the goblins. I told him that he risked them overtaking him, so we rolled a Daring Conflict. Before the dice hit the table that warrior stated that he stayed behind to shield the Mage, which his player regretted almost immediately since the die showed that they had been overrun.  The mage went down in round one, the warrior hit zero hit points in the second yet stayed in the fight thanks to a stubbornness based talent. The party waded in and after the twenty goblins were hewed (the priest nearly losing his spirit guardian in the process) they had to defeat their first NPC, the Orc Slaver. He nearly took out the Barbarian before some barbarian-scoundrel teamwork took him out. With their noses bloodied, their pride suitably humbled the party retreated out of the dungeon to rest up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this point on their mojo was broken. Sneaking in the alternative entrance the scoundrel was savaged and taken out by giant rats, and because of a long discussion on guild regulations concerning treasure sharing and long-fingered scoundrels, the barbarian was taken out by five orcs before we called it a night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was pure nostalgic fun. The Red Box Hack works like a dream. And it is so easy to modify to your personal preferences that doing so is a charm in itself. My players loved it and we will play it some more before it most likely will become one of our regular short notice pick up games.<br/>\nMy players only concern was that it might be too light to hold our attention for a longer campaign. I think it is a bit too early to tell, and I am all fired up to play it again. You have a winner here Eric.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122003/#Comment_122003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T04:58:09+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  4:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mint ! <br><br>and the rumours bit - that's an excellent idea.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122004/#Comment_122004" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T04:59:26+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  4:59AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Kaare  !<br><br>This is a great write-up ! I am realy curious to see the talents you created for your new classes. I agree with you that, besides its already excellent system, one of the RBH strenghts is that it is highly customisable : new classes, talents, even new attributes, something other than mere monsters and treasure and you have another game.<br>I am tempted, since I've played the game, to ask Eric for a "Hack the Hack" challenge where people would submit this kind of add-ons. But I think the game deserves to be further tested as it is now. So I wait.<br><br>But, as I said, I am curious to see your specific mods. And monsters too, of course.<br><br>Best,<br>Antoine                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122007/#Comment_122007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T05:24:39+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  5:24AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hiya Kaare,</p>\n<p>Thanks for the write-up.
