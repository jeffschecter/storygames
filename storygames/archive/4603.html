FATE is my current go-to example,  but there are many possibilities. It also rather assumes alternating phases of investigation and confrontation.<br/><br/>The idea is that the players get points (e.g. Fate Points) by declaring Beliefs as a result of their investigative work. When they think they have discovered something as a result of their investigation, but not yet proved it beyond all doubt, they propose it as a suggested Belief ("Martians are behind the disappearances in Basildon" or "The Mysterious Old Man is really an FBI agent sent to assassinate Castro"). The GM then makes them an offer of how many points they will give each player who takes it as a Belief. Zero if it's already established,  progressively more for wilder leaps and greater implications ("The President is a robot!"). If any player accepts the offer, they take the Belief, and record the number of points that they were given for it.<br/><br/>Beliefs can be taken at any time when not actually in the middle of a conflict (maybe even then?) and essentially provide the fuel to make sure you at least get out of one alive, even if you fail to triumph.<br/><br/>The sting in the tail comes if a Belief turns out to be false beyond doubt. ("You shoot the President. His head appears to be full of blood and brains"). At this point, something bad happens. In a Lovecraftian game, loss of sanity is the obvious consequence. In other genres, loss of morale/conviction, reputation or even skill could be possibilities. And/or you could substitute a new Belief for the old one ("I need psychiatric attention" or "Robots have real brains!").<br/><br/>In FATE, the GM could Compel Beliefs as though they were Aspects (they would be) and add to the Fate Point total attached to each one, adding to the consequences of them being wrong.<br/><br/>You could allow players to hedge their bets by being able to spend points to "buy off" the belief before it was disproved, or even to escape the bad consequences by repaying the point debt. Then again, where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104202/#Comment_104202" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T16:03:55+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  4:03PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought is "ooooh!"<br/><br/>Who would've the plot questions in 1001 Nights would be a way to model the hypothesis&gt;experiment&gt;result scientific method?

Could be a fun way to reward the players for working to solve the puzzle (although I guess they are already working to solve the puzzle).<br/><br/>A thought:<br/><br/>1. The GM knows the Truth and sets up the clues. So the GM's game is to set up lots of Red Herrings in order to lure the players into his traps.<br/>2. The GM also decides how many Fate points you get for Believing one of his Red Herrings, i.e. how off the wall the Belief is (even if the GM knows it is True).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104253/#Comment_104253" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T00:53:52+00:00" title="October 23, 2007 12:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>What is to stop players from just turtling and never testing their hypothesis, thus keeping their fate points and never learning the SHOCKING TRUTH?</blockquote> Yeah, good question. I guess one answer is for the GM only to make offers on propositions that they think are likely to be resolved in the course of (whatever it is that is motivating the players to investigate). I can see there could be a problem here, though. If the players are investigating some murders, and don't know whether it's a vampire or a werewolf responsible (for example), the fact that the GM is prepared to make an offer on "werewolves can be killed by silver bullets" but not on "vampires are repelled by garlic" is a giveaway. Hmmm. May need to be more careful about the nature of the hypotheses.<br/><br/>Another possibility might be "double your money" - if the players manage to confirm their hunch, they get an additional point bonus equal to the initial payout plus any stake-raising in the meantime.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>So the GM's game is to set up lots of Red Herrings in order to lure the players into his traps.</blockquote> I think this rather depends on genre and group tastes. Too much in the way of red herrings might provoke turtling, depending on consequences, etc. Then again, in a more "locked room mystery" type context, I guess it could be acceptable.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about this approach is that the GM is not required to work out ahead of time what is actually true, or to stick to it. If the players come up with something outrageous, the GM can still decide to adopt it on the fly as truth. It works either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
