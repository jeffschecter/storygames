How hard would it be to organize a mini-con in the Triangle area? Assuming, of course, that we haven't already had one and I missed it.<br/><br/>I know there's a lot of game designers in the area. Is there any interest in pursuing this?<br/><br/>I can think of a few ways that this event might manifest itself:<br/><br/>First, we could find a sizable venue, preferably well-lit and sheltered from the harsh and inclement elements. This might cost some money. Or not -- if the group includes someone who's a student at a local university, for example, we might be able to secure a meeting area on campus.<br/><br/>Second, we could meet at someone's home, but unless your place was recently featured on MTV's Cribs, I'm thinking it might get a little crowded (depending on how many people get involved).<br/><br/>Third, we could convince a local game store to host us. All Fun &amp; Games (Highway 64) has a decent gaming area. And they've let me run demo games there before.<br/><br/>Feedback? Interest? Ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128422/#Comment_128422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:10:33+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 7:12AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (we're talking about central North Carolina, USA)<br/><br/>We've had a number of cat-themed house-cons over the years and we'll need to add you to the list!

As usual, she was great to talk to. Very nice person.<br/><br/>Their game room can hold between 50 and 60 people. On Saturdays, they host Magic: The Gathering enthusiasts. However, if we wanted to schedule a mini-con in advance, AFNG would let us have the whole place to ourselves. This would probably need to be timed to coincide with a lull in MtG gaming -- apparently, there's a major Magic release in July or August, so right before then would be the best time for the Triangle Mini-Con.<br/><br/>Vivienne also noted that if we ran sessions of our own games at the event, she would be happy to find a way to make these available to her patrons. For example, consignment sales, or maybe IPR (I told her a little bit about how it works, and she said that sounded good -- though I'm sure she'd want to learn a little bit more about it from someone more knowledgeable than myself).<br/><br/>At any rate, if there's enough interest, I can make the arrangements. The upshot will be that in order to pull off a successful event (and thereby improve the chances of a second such opportunity), we'll need to get forty or fifty people in the store on the day of the event.<br/><br/>Alternately, we could just gather in smaller numbers, and that would bring the date of the event forward a little bit (if there were only a dozen or two people, then this would not require six months of planning and scheduling on AFNG's part).<br/><br/>What do you guys think? I'm meeting with her next week to discuss the possibility in more detail. Input welcome. I'm just gathering info and presenting it to the collective hive-mind of SG, here.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128529/#Comment_128529" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:39:29+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to give a quick second to the comments about Vivian.

If the only people who show up are the band members, it's not so much fun.<br/><br/>The reason that Vivienne recommended a five- or six-month lead time was to give the event time to accumulate interest. AFNG has a blog, a myspace, a facebook, a facespace, whatever the Christ. And I know that all of us do as well. And the store, AFNG, we could post fliers (she lets me advertise there all time, it's cool) and posters and such. Hell, give out CDs with PDF demos burned on them to whet the interest of her customers.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm sure we could pull together a large group of people in the amount of time allotted.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Normally, I'm like "Consignment?

And FWIW, consignment is one option, but that's only if you don't have distribution and you really want to make the game available in the store on the day of the event or whatever. You could also hand out information so that people can order the game off Lulu or whatnot. When I run games at MACE and GenCon, I feel iffy about selling my game, since I haven't paid for dealer space, so if any of the gamers is interested, I give them the URL and some handouts. Same thing would probably apply to this con if consigment and distribution aren't feasible options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128549/#Comment_128549" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:52:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I can contact Fred with IPR and make some fliers and see who wants to send copies of games ...</blockquote>\nRight on!<br/><br/>So... what do we call this thing?

I'm thinking it's going to be a bit like NC Game Day, but focused on independently-published games. Though I see no reason to exclude anyone, so if someone wants to run a game of Rifts, hell, I got a third level Juicer with a vibro-katana, so count me in.<br/><br/>I mentioned the game designer angle because I think that part of the appeal of the event is that local gamers will have an opportunity to do the following:<br/>1. Enjoy a well-organized con without having to pay for it;<br/>2. Play new games, and get exposed to new play styles; and<br/>3. Meet the designers of the games in question.<br/><br/>NC Game Day does all of the above, to a degree, but it's only a few times a year, so I think another mini-con would be a good thing.<br/><br/>Having thought it over, I'm leaning towards the following structure for CollectiveCon: There are 9 tables, and we have 12 hours, so 3 slots per table seems pretty logical (but this means that each session can be no longer than 3 hours, to allow time for meals). This adds up to 27 three-hour slots. I doubt we have 27 game designers in the area, so no matter what, everyone should have an opportunity to run at least one session of his/her game. In addition, designers will be able to hand out promotional materials (hell, we might even collect them in a bag or package of some kind, and give one to each person who plays a game).<br/><br/>What do you guys think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129265/#Comment_129265" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:07:23+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I love the idea of a new convention in town.</p>\n<p>But I hate the three hour slot size.

When I walk out of a game at Origins and GenCon, my ears are ringing and my throat hurts from trying to talk over the volume.  I hate that.  I don't have that issue at NC Game Day.  I would be so happy if I didn't have that issue at your convention either.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129271/#Comment_129271" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:13:13+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

The target audience will consist of local gamers, but many of the people in attendance will be AFNG customers. As we get closer to the date (ideally, early July), I'd like to provide Vivienne with promotional materials that she can distribute. For example, a "mix CD" which contains PDF demos for several different games that will be run at the con.<br/><br/>This will:<br/>1. Provide information about the games that will be run;<br/>2. Allow people to become at least slightly familiar with the rules and concepts; and <br/>3. Allow people, through hyperlinks embedded in the PDF, to purchase these games ahead of time.<br/><br/>There's no rush, as the promotional materials don't really need to go up until a few months before the event (I'm thinking March or April would be a good time to try to build awareness in the public).<br/><br/>In late April, I'll be attending NC Game Day, and I'll try to get the word out about CollectiveCon through fliers and such. And the aforementioned message boards.<br/><br/>NC Game Day has a pretty good system for organizing their events -- pretty straightforward stuff like sign-up sheets, reserved and numbered tables, and so on. Unless there's a better idea, I'd like to swipe their system. The only thing that I don't know how to emulate is their registration process. For an event like this, it might be cool to just have people sign up for things on the day of the event. Thoughts?<br/><br/>If anyone has any ideas about promotion, building interest, event organization, games that they'd like to run, cool ways to do things, whatever, please let me know!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129669/#Comment_129669" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T06:23:56+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  6:23AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We might see about running some demos in the run-up to this event, maybe a month or two in advance, as well.
