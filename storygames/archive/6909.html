I just did a quick tally.  There are 95 characters illustrated in the Player's Handbook.  Of those, 14 are dragon blooded and three are unidentifiable (wearing helmets or facing away).  Of those remaining, 52 are obviously white, thirteen are tieflings who range between white and purple, but look "white" to me, ten have indistinct ethnicities, and three are obviously non-white.<br/><br/>It's kind of weird peering at a picture and trying to figure out the ethnicity depicted, so I'm not making any absolute claims.  My figures are based on my own perception, which is not exactly a fair metric.  It seems to me that by most standards, this is a pretty whitewashed presentation of characters.  3e. wasn't exactly perfect, but I thought Wizards would do better than this.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the sexualised pictures of women, either.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153816/#Comment_153816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T08:33:07+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  8:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very, very simple explanation.

Give them some kind of different protrusions on their heads, colouration or make them two feet taller. Use your imaginations, you're artists for christ's sake. Or hell, don't use your imagination and look to nature as inspiration. Why, just check out this description of the differences between genders in bengal monitor lizards from Wikipedia:<br><br/>"The males can grow up to 100cm. The females, on the other hand, do not grow this large. It has also been found that females have a much shorter tail and lack pre-anal flaps which can be found in males as patches of scales."<br/><br/>Instead of merely adding boobs to that dragonborn paladin you just drew, just remove the pre-anal flaps.

In the PHB it says humans have a range from black to pale snow with all the tans in between.  Forgotten Realms is even MORE diverse than Europe was with nations with non-European ethnicities abound very close to the "main" areas of Waterdeep and the Dalelands.  And Eberron has all of humanity basically on one continent. So, it's strange.  For the Realms and default D&amp;D setting (does that have a name?), we should see a whole slew of colors. For Eberron, it could be more limited, I don't recall any nations having a particular ethnicity though, so they might just as easily all be white, as brown, as black. If you take the human average, the depictions seem off though. Unless there's a reason for doing otherwise (like Middle Earth or Hyborian's "lost histories" of Europe) I like the Earth Sea method, or simply having a huge variety and drop preconceptions, like Reign, but even going further. Brown skin and blue eyes? Sure. Black skin and blond hair? Sure. White skin and black hair? Sure.

Perfect-bound adventures, progressing across a select campaign or two. When I was in Utah I stopped by a gaming store in Provo and bought a ton of D&amp;D Minis while sifting through the stuff on the racks.<br/><br/>I didn't but the adventures, because... well... I don't think I've ever purchased a published adventure. But holy fuck, the art on those things was really cool. Sharp, heroic-looking black paladin kicking ass, for the most part.  IIRC, one of the supplements to Guild Wars was like that, too (a kind of Western-mythical City of Black People who Kick Ass).<br/><br/>Ah, here are some links:<br/><br/><a href="http://paizo.com/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/Pathfinder7_Paladin.jpg" rel="nofollow">Seela the Paladin</a><br/><br/><a href="http://chattydm.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pathfinderdesktop-4.jpg" rel="nofollow">Badass Horseman Chick</a><br/><br/><a href="http://paizo.com/image/product/secondary/Pathfinder/PathfinderDesktop-2_1024x768.jpg" rel="nofollow">OK, this is kinda cheesecakey,</a> but it looks like a van filled with Suicide Girl crashed into a truckload of swarthy middle-easterner.

She is hot, she has feminine-formed armor, but she doesn't have to flaunt her wares in some cheap and degrading costume bikini. She is definitely a paladin, and her smug expression carries that. She is black without being made into "the token black character", at least in the art. She is confidently every part of her identity.<br/><br/>I dig it for similar reasons for the other characters. They are a composite of their background, ambitions, class, culture and everything.<br/><br/>And that cheesecake-y character, I love that she exists too. I love that Paizo clearly isn't putting chicks in armor to say, "See, world, we don't objectify our women because we're politically enlightened above that shit." Paizo's artists and designers made the paladin sexy and well-equipped and stoic and feminine, and they made the scantily-clad mage sexy and seductive and dangerous. The Pathfinder series feels like its proud of all of its characters, and it has a right to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153947/#Comment_153947" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T16:21:31+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  4:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>but if you'll keep attracting issues to this thread, none will advance much.</blockquote>\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by this . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153948/#Comment_153948" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T16:24:09+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  4:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railing against the use of "Man" as a placeholder for "Human".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153949/#Comment_153949" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T16:28:26+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  4:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Railing against the use of "Man" as a placeholder for "Human".</blockquote>\nMy tone must have come across as more serious than I intended it be.

Me and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislaus_II_of_Bohemia" rel="nofollow">Vladislaus, the Second King of Bohemia</a> would both check the "white" box on the SAT, but we don't share much else in common.<br><br>But traditional fantasy generally replaces the deep ethnic and cultural diversity of the world with diversity among the various species (elves, dwarves, gnomes, bugbears, etc.)  That sometimes becomes a problem because there's no elf-bugbear crossover species, but there are, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nogais" rel="nofollow">hybrid Turkish and Mongol peoples</a> on the map I linked, and thousands upon thousands of other combinations.  Ethnicity is fluid and changing, but "race" in the fantasy sense of different species, is not.  Half-elves don't count.  <br/><br/>And it leads to the problem where humans are frequently depicted as white (though sometimes not), post-Tolkien elves are always white (unless they're evil and live underground), 'little people' species (dwarves, gnomes, halflings) are always white (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikabrik#N" rel="nofollow">unless they're evil</a>), and the ethnic diversity of the real world just disappears.  And there's not even much ethnic or cultural diversity <i>within</i> humankind, right?  There are human kingdoms and elven kingdoms and what not.  If there are multiple human kingdoms, then you have the token Asian kingdom combining China / Japan / Korea / Southeast Asia, the token Nordic kingdom, the token jungle kingdom where there might be some brown people, or maybe just face-eating lizardmen who dress and act like stereotypes of native brown people.  That's not ethnic diversity.  That's marking off checkboxes on the SAT.  That's saying there's no difference between me and Vlad, there.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153985/#Comment_153985" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T19:16:13+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure we're agreeing here.

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Traditional fantasy generally replaces the deep ethnic and cultural diversity of the world with diversity among the various species (elves, dwarves, gnomes, bugbears, etc.) That sometimes becomes a problem because there's no elf-bugbear crossover species, but there are, say,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nogais" rel="nofollow">hybrid Turkish and Mongol peoples</a>on the map I linked, and thousands upon thousands of other combinations. Ethnicity is fluid and changing, but "race" in the fantasy sense of different species, is not. Half-elves don't count.</blockquote>\nAs I've said before, fantasy races are a fantasy about race - immutable, easily identifiable, and strongly deterministic.  They're what racists want human "races" to be.  (Please note, I'm not saying that fantasy races are by definition racist).<br/><br/>I think the reason I brought this up, rather than just sighing and letting it go, is because I feel like Wizards had a real opportunity to do something good here.  I don't agree that "The default fantasy world for the vast majority of the works within that genre is a fantastical version of Medieval or Renaissance Europe." or at least, I don't believe it has to be that way.  D&amp;D has been moving away from many of those traditional fantasy tropes for a long time.  The "points of light" setting, where people live among the ruins of ancient empires, was a great opportunity to have huge varieties of cultures, ethnicities, and skin colours blended into new combinations.  They've got a great excuse to have all kinds of ethicities represented in PC parties, and they didn't take the opportunity.  I know that Wizards is sensitive to these issues, because they've spoken about it in the past, and it just seems like they dropped the ball here.<br/><br/>If I have time, I'll address the representation of women in a different thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153992/#Comment_153992" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T19:35:00+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2008 7:37PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, yeah, sure, Tolkien drew on a lot of Nordic stuff, based on his literary background, but there's also, like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katar" rel="nofollow">katar</a> in the PHB, right?

This is problematic too in some ways, but at least it overcomes the problems with underrepresentation.

A bit from here, a bit from there, mix together with no concern for flavour.<br/><br/>I don't buy that schlock, and I don't play it. I do note that it draws cries of 'awesome'! That's here on a forum with a high proportion of thoughtful, intelligent people. How do you expect it goes down elsewhere, particularly among the core demographic (ie middle-class Anglo-Celtic teenagers)? WotC is interested in making profits, and if there were profit in ethnic diversity I'm sure it would be better-represented.<br/><br/>If you want to address diversity, why don't you restrict yourselves to playing games that do address it? Or construct your own historical or pseudo-historical games? That's what I do, as a brown-hued person.

I mean, WOTC seems to be targetting this at existing gaming audiences, yeah?  Because what about folks like you or me who might be really put off by all the whitewashing?  Surely we're part of the market that they are potentially interested in grabbing.  Would they alienate a sizable portion of their core audience by throwing some ethnic diversity into the game?  That's possible I guess, but hard for me to imagine.  I generally like to be optimistic that people can rise to the occasion and deal with real diversity when they encounter it, like Iowa voting for Obama.  Instead, I would blame the status quo for underestimating the intelligence and open-mindedness of their audience.  I don't think roleplayers are judgemental bigots, mostly.  Not likely to push themselves into unfamiliar ethnic territory without some prodding?  Sure, but that doesn't mean it always makes the best financial sense to cater to their base impulses.<br/><br/>Honestly, if this wasn't D&amp;D, I would care less.  I mean, yet another stereotype-promoting fantasy game is sad, but I sigh and hope that it sells the very tiny number of copies that it deserves.  With D&amp;D, it has a bigger effect on the whole environment, including the diversity of people encountered at things like GenCon.  Sure, I can be over here in the corner playing <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> and <i>Thou Art But a Warrior</i> and <i>The Blossoms Are Falling</i> and other games that take culture and ethnicity seriously, but it still sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154006/#Comment_154006" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T20:15:16+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  8:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Honestly, if this wasn't D&amp;D, I would care less.

Why should I care that a marginal cultural form like RPGs is? And I'm afraid that I don't share your optimism concerning the general RPG-buying public, any more than I would share it concerning the music-buying public, or the novel-buying public. Nobody ever went broke under-estimating the public's taste.<br/><br/>See, I'm not put off D&amp;D because of the lack of ethnic diversity. I'm put off for aesthetic reasons. I'm perfectly happy to play DitV, which is about white people, or Pendragon, which is a quintessentially Western European myth.

There's a notion that it arises from the prudish nature of Protestant culture. Sleeping with native women produced little brown babies, who were integrated into society in the Hispanic colonies (in a complicated system of colour hierarchies), but denied in the Anglo colonies. You might say that while the Hispanic peoples lived alongside the natives, the Anglo peoples perforce pushed them aside or exterminated them. Thus the Anglo nations developed very strong prejudices against people of colour (see: White Australia Policy). This was further complicated by the role of slavery in the United States.<br/><br/>Now you're dealing with post-colonial guilt and confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154071/#Comment_154071" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T06:39:11+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  6:39AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, clearly these (race, skin colour, gender represenations) are issues that people feel strongly about, but aren't we talking about a fantasy world?

 'cheesecake' armor.<br/>p4/5 -- male human in armor -- white guy; female halfling -- Asian-seeming; male dwarf -- white/European<br/>p12/13 -- male human wizard -- white guy<br/>p32/33 -- mane human in armor -- white guy<br/>p36 -- male dwarf -- white; female dwarf -- white (&amp; her armor is pretty reasonable)<br/>p38 -- female eladrin, dressed appropriately<br/>p40 -- female elf ranger, showing some skin, but she's not dressed in armor<br/>p42 -- male half-elf -- white guy; female half-elf -- white female in reasonable leather armor<br/>p44 -- male halfling -- white guy; female halfling -- ethnically black, dressed in entirely reasonable leather armor<br/>p46 -- male human -- white guy, sort of Slavic cast to his features;  female human -- Asian (dressed in leather armor showing bare midriff! and with weird cut-outs on the backs of her thighs...???<br/>p48 -- female tiefling -- pale skin, red eyes, dark hair, and wearing impractical unpadded chainmail tank-top with some bare midriff showing...<br/>p50/51  -- female dwarf -- ethnicity hard to determine, but culturally Asian-seeming since she's in Kabuki-style makeup!; male human -- white guy, bald with tattoos on his head; male human wizard with wand -- white guy<br/>p60 -- male human cleric -- ethnically indeterminate, with ruddy skin, almond-shaped eyes, and a broad flat nose<br/>p70 -- female dwarf cleric -- ethnically European-seeming, but her armor is realistic enough<br/>p72 -- male dwarf(?) cleric -- ethnicity indeterminate since he's using Angelic Presence, but his hair is black and his visible skin seems dark<br/>p83 -- male human -- white guy<br/>p89 -- male half-elf paladin --  Asian or Mongolian in appearance<br/>p103 -- female elf ranger -- showing some skin, but not that inappropriate since she is wearing cloth clothing not armor<br/>p116 -- male human rogue -- white guy<br/>p129 -- female tiefling warlock -- showing some cleavage above her corset, but not unreasonable for a tiefling<br/>p143 -- male dwarf -- European-seeming<br/>p148 -- male human warlord -- white guy<br/>p165 -- female dwarf wizard -- ethnically European (looks kind of like a short Sophia Loren), dressed appropriately<br/>p176/177 -- male human in background -- white guy<br/>p184 -- male dwarf -- European; female human -- European, dressed appropriately; male human -- ethnically indeterminate but darker-skinned than anyone else in the picture<br/>p189 -- female tiefling rogue, in leather armor, showing no skin<br/>p190/191 -- male human rogue -- European;

 his injured comrade is a white guy<br/>p16 -- female human wizard -- European, wearing peekaboo robes...<br/>p19 -- female dwarf wizard -- Asian in appearance<br/>p29 -- female elf in light armor, not unreasonable;  female tiefling fighter in leather armor showing bare midriff<br/>p33 -- male halfing -- whtie guy; female human -- also white, or possibly Asian<br/>p34/35 -- female dwarf in background, ethnically indeterminate due do lighting and distance, but armored appropriately<br/>p37 -- male human -- I think it's the Slavic-looking guy again<br/>p38/39 -- female half-elf fighter -- Nordic-looking features and armor, but the armor is reasonable; male dwarf -- European<br/>p52/53 -- female archer in foreground wearing reasonable scale armor; male dwarf on bridge -- European;  female tiefling wizard dressed appropriately (for a tiefling anyway); male half-elf -- white guy<br/>p63 -- female eladrin with katar -- dressed in cloth with bits of impractical armor, showing a little cleavage<br/>p66 -- female halfling or human -- ethnically indeterminate due to lighting, but with almond-shaped eyes<br/>p70 -- male dwarf -- European<br/>p73 -- female half-elf rogue, dressed appropriately<br/>p77 -- male human whispering -- olive skin and dark hair;

 female dwarf -- European<br/>p145 -- female paladin(?) -- ethnically indeterminate with pale skin and almond-shaped eyes (her hair is covered by her helm), her armor shows some cleavage, but is actually not completely unreasonable since the huge shoulder-guards prevent most hits to that area... except for a direct thrust<br/>p148/149 -- male human fighter in armor -- white guy;  female human in leather-and-scale armor in foreground -- ethnically white, wearing armor that shows bare midriff<br/>p172/173 -- male human figher -- white guy;  female halfling in armor with warhammer -- white, with her hair in braids/dreadlocks; her armor is reasonable full-coverage plate<br/>p193 -- male human wizard or warlock -- white guy; female eladrin wizard in clothing that is fanciful but not 'cheesecake'<br/>p194 -- female bugbear -- wearing armor that shows cleavage, proving that it's not just a human fetish...<br/>p196/197 -- street scene with dozens of figures, but the female halfling in the upper right buying robes is the Asian-seeming one from p4/5.  All the other humans and near-humans appear to be ethnically European -- but it's a street scene with northern-European-inspired architecture.<br/>p201 -- five discernible humans, all ethnically European-seeming (not unreasonable, since they are all residents of the same small village)<br/>p209 -- female human or halfling rogue or ranger -- white<br/><br/>So, to sum up my point -- yes, there's an awful lot of white guys out there in the artwork; but there are more non-white characters than there were ten years ago, so progress toward diversity is being made.  Is Paizo doing it better?  Probably, but there's a great deal of progress shown <i>here</i> -- especially when it comes to the female characters.  There are as many female characters shown as males, and they are shown as every class, even the 'warrior' classes, with about equal frequency to the males.  They are shown as 'sexy' in many cases -- but so are many of the males, if you swing that way.  Beyond that, the <i>worst</i> excesses of 'cheesecake' armor in the 4th Edition art are mild compared to what was standard in fantasy artwork in years past.  <br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154091/#Comment_154091" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T08:33:38+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  8:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to underline again... at last, some good looking (heck, even hot, I'd say) dwarven women!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154093/#Comment_154093" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T08:52:09+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  8:52AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">@Jonathan</a> and Brian: thanks.

But where I, personally, get hung up is on what I quoted above.  I don't think that being bothered by racist/sexist/homophobic/what-have-you statements is necessarily being "offended on behalf of a third party."  And, I think I'm a little offended at your suggestion that's all it is.  Not much, but a little.  I dunno exactly how to explain my opinion about this, but empathy is a core trait of humanity, I think.  You'd have a be a cold, cold person to only be bothered by things that happen directly to you.  Besides, me, a white man, calling someone out for being sexist or racist can be self-protection as well, depending on how you look at it.  If someone is cold and unempathetic enough to abuse or demean someone due to race or sex, who's to say they won't see some category in me they don't like?  Possibly my religion, my sexual orientation, or any number of other things.<br/><br/>Anyway... not sure if I'm making sense or not, but hopefully I am.<br/><br/>edit: fixed something my spell checker "fixed" and thus destroyed the original meaning                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154225/#Comment_154225" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T15:48:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  3:48PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KCassidy</cite>REIGN would have done much better on this issue if the racial types described in the text were the same ones pictured in the artwork.

I disagree with you about whether we can disregard the ethnicities of tieflings and elves, but I think we came to somewhat similar conclusions.  I guess where you saw "good progress", I saw "not there yet".  <br/><br/>The representations of women are a whole different kettle of fish.  I think we probably need a seperate thread for that.  In brief, I agree that there's been a lot of progress in having female characters portrayed as competent and powerful, but I think that's undermined somewhat by them being almost uniformly presented as sexualized.  If you want to talk about that more, maybe we could start another thread?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>I think the fact that Story Games is a community with so many game designers means that this is a conversation we should be having, despite most of us being white. Content producers, be they game designer or artist or something else, would do well to consider these issues. As much as we might like to, you can't divorce RPGs from the real world just by slapping a fantasy label on your game. The content you produce does NOT exist in a vaccuum, people WILL bring real life sensibilities to what you create, and they will judge you for it.<br/><br/>Saying that we shouldn't have this conversation because we're mostly white here isn't fair, because it shuts down a good conversation - one that needs to be had.<br/><br/>Speaking as a woman, I would have no problem with a roomful of men saying 'what are we going to do about sexism'. That would be FANTASTIC. Because it would be different than the status quo, which is roomfuls of men refusing to talk about sexism ever.</blockquote>\nI think Anna has probably found the most useful purpose for this thread.  I don't expect Wizards to change what they do based on my criticism, but we can be aware of how Wizards failed, and make sure not to make the same mistakes ourselves, both in game design and in how we run games.<br/><br/>As this thread gets longer, the possibilty for acrimony increases while the possibility of useful discussion goes down.  I think it might be wise to let this thread die now, unless someone's got something really burning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154238/#Comment_154238" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T16:58:29+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  4:58PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yep Simon it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law" rel="nofollow">Godwin's law</a> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154241/#Comment_154241" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T17:13:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  5:13PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KCassidy</cite>offended on behalf of a third party</blockquote>\nMan, I think this idea bugged me more than I realized at the time.

Specifically, when I bought the Outcast of Redwall, which was about (IIRC, it's been a LONG time) a ferret that was born at Redwall (or adopted by them at a very early age, I think, maybe) I was hoping it might finally be about an "evil animal" that might be good.  But no such luck.  He was as nasty in the end as every other ferret in those books ever was.  I think it might be one of the reasons I stopped reading them despite the fact that I still enjoy kid-lit every now and again to this day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154288/#Comment_154288" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T20:06:50+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  8:06PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2008 8:07PM by fnord3125.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>The problem is not the talking per say but rather what we are saying by doing it, that its our problem to solve and something that the people in question can't or won't solve for themselves.<br/></blockquote>\nI still can't believe that it's better to ignore it completely.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so this response, like many others lately, are way off topic from the initial thread, but I think it's bringing up some really good talking points.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>The problem is not the talking per say but rather what we are saying by doing it, that its our problem to solve and something that the people in question can't or won't solve for themselves.<br/><br/>Its a bit more like me discussing the rwandian genocide, and yeah it really is a bit useless (go ahead and try it if your not directly affect see what happens, I can guaranty you a big fat squat)<br/><br/>Its a touchy area, but shouting down someone just cause you disagree with them what can i say *fuck that noise*</blockquote>\nBut then, shouting down has its place.  No one's doing that here, so I won't go into too much the caveat that it's probably not useful for online discussions, but in person? Silent complacency has historically been the primary weapon of racists and authoritarians to remain in power. So, calling people on their shit actually has been very effective. You just might have to face the consequences, like being punched in the face or hung from a tree (thankfully, the latter has become an extremely rare response thanks to many people going "fuck that noise").<br/><br/>But this isn't about a disagreement either. I don't see racism as mere difference of opinion. And its pretty ridiculous to say that whites have no control over racism or that being vocal about it is patronizing.  As far as I can tell, at least in American society, whites are the only race that doesn't talk about racism.<br/><br/>In fact, as Graham points out:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>All I'm saying is: if everyone posting in a thread about race is white, alarm bells should be ringing in your mind. Can this really be an effective conversation if the people we're talking about aren't represented in the conversation? Sure, we can talk about it for a while, but after a while we have to admit we don't really understand the issue.</blockquote>\nNot understanding the issue is a major problem! Alarm bells should be ringing when someone tells you that you have no place to talk about racism because of your skin color. Whites are part of the issue. All races are a part of the issue. Just because you aren't the target of racism doesn't mean you aren't a part of it. After all, what do you think feeling above the concerns of race because of your skin color is? <br/><br/>Not talking about it won't help anyone gain understanding. And if whites can't even be comfortable talking about the impact of racism, about white priviledge, about the systematic bias against ethnic neighborhoods, about racial profiling, how can anyone expect racism to even be dealt with in a real way? Whites dominate, if not outright control most of the organizations that run our society.  So, I don't know how any reasonable person could think that whites aren't a part of the problem, and that it's something for "the people in question to solve for themselves."  <b>We all are the people in question.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154449/#Comment_154449" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:18:59+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>The problem is not the talking per say but rather what we are saying by doing it, that its our problem to solve and something that the people in question can't or won't solve for themselves.</blockquote>\nI'd like to come back to this idea again.<br/>I think that this, like almost everything in existence, and especially political/social ideas, is a matter of perspective.<br/>If you want to find fault with someone you're going to.<br/>So yeah, it's probably pretty easy to look at a group of white men talking about racism and sexism asking "What should we do about this?" and say "Look at those jerks, thinking it's up to THEM to solve this problem!"  But if you want to be charitable you can also look at it and say, "Hey, isn't it good that those white men are at least AWARE that there may be a problem of racism/sexism here rather than being oblivious because they're not suffering the effects of it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154451/#Comment_154451" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:27:18+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^ What he said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154455/#Comment_154455" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:36:45+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that's been going in my head while reading this thread:<br/><br/>I really like it when fiction portrays diversity.

I'd much rather have those things depicted for the legitimate reasons that such depictions can and should occur rather than an artificially attempt to include them for the purpose of making some sort of statement about diversity.  Taking time to address the theme of "showing how wonderfully different people are out there" can really dilute the attention that could be focused on a particular theme.

If, as Mr. Walton has suggested, that the whitewashing of art hinder's WotC's marketing, then simply take the company from them.  How?  Follow along for a moment:<br/>WotC's parent, Hasbro, is a public corporation, one which you can buy stock in.  Public corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder value.  If they fail to do so, minority shareholders can sue for relief.<br/><br/>Here is the proposal (warning, I am a vaugley incompetent non-lawyer):<br/>Buy one or more shares of HAS stock (supposedly a good time to buy in that sector anyway, slight downtick toward the bell might signal a buying opportunity, but it's too close to the 52-week high for my tastes-- $34.88 per share.)  Have your friends do the same, and don't do it in a managed (IRA/401K/mutual fund) account.<br/>Make the case at the annual shareholder's meeting that the WotC division could be making more money if X. (With X="behaves in the way I want them to.")  They will expect to see solid market research, and will unlikely be willing to force a change without significant evidence.  Record your statement at the shareholder's meeting, you'll need it for evidence later.<br/>When changes don't happen, threaten to sue as a class of minority shareholders.  Realistically, your damages are probably less than a buck, but that less than a buck times 4.8 billion outstanding shares adds up to serious cash.  Approach Hasbro and offer to buy WotC at a discount in exchange for dropping the suit. Change WotC's motto to "the race and gender sensitive game company."

Instead, it's almost assuredly an assumption on the part of the artist, or the designer or art director in the case of any detailed character descriptions. I'd love to see the memo that says anything remotely like "Since our demographics are 80% white, we should make sure all the art is 80% white as well." In other words, it's the demographics of the creators that have a much greater impact than market research.

How about those people in the minority being pissed off and not buying the product? </blockquote>\nI joined a local D&amp;D game when KotS came out.  I'm the only person of European descent.  The rest are Chinese and Malay.  Does anyone really pick up the book, page through it and go "there's not enough pictures of my ethnicity, I'm so angry!" and not buy it?  Local gamers here in the most ethnically diverse neighbourhood in Canada certainly aren't doing that.  If someone did raise such an objection, how does this constitute them suffering?  And once again, if it is suffering, it what way are those who benefit from it doing so?<br/><br/>Seriously, do we want a quota system?  Should we be taking population demographics and making sure the percentage of artwork matches those numbers?  Should there be different print runs/editions of the books to represent various local population make ups?  Would it be more or less racist to have a "Black" edition of D&amp;D for sale in communities made up of those of African descent?<br/><br/>Perhaps a list should be made of every single ethnicity on the planet and you can't use one twice until you've represented them all.<br/><br/>For those who like to get up in arms over the representation of ethnicities in fantasy artwork, what do you actually want?  In real terms please.  If someone is an art director or writer and is about to make a decision, what should they do?  How do they decide on percentages of different ethnicities?  Should any fantasy setting loosely based on Medieval Europe immediately be scrapped and replaced by one where all the races of the earth somehow co mingle in equal percentages?  Or perhaps one where the migratory forces that created the various races on Earth didn't occur?

It doesn't hurt my feelings because I have no interest in it other than a sort of meta-interest (what's going on with the squares sort of thing).<br/><br/>I don't want to wave credentials around, since I happen to think that privileging my voice because I'm not 100% whitebread is bullshit. But I have certainly experienced very direct racism. On some sort of scale from 1 to 10, silly pictures in D&amp;D rate about 0.2 for me. Again, I say, I don't fully understand how adults can take it quite so seriously (the same applies to comics). If we're talking textual deconstruction, there are problematic texts out there with far greater circulation.<br/><br/>If you want realistic armour, there have been games out there since the 80s that do that. I suggest taking a look at RuneQuest, for example. If you want games that try to look more deeply into other cultures, you don't have to go much further than your own attempt.<br/><br/>If you really feel that taking action on D&amp;D is important, you could try doing as Brand suggested. Personally, it seems to me that it will achieve little, but I guess opting out of that market like me also achieves very little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154902/#Comment_154902" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T18:58:37+00:00" title="July  4, 2008  6:58PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>That was pretty funny, even though some of the jokes went over my head.

The problem is, the suffering is invisible because it's largely subsumed.  It's a symptom. And when you see a little black girl, given a black doll still prefers a white doll because she's been taught that's what beautiful looks like, there's your suffering. When you hear an Indian gamer (see the first comment in Adam's link) see a heroic character that looks like him, or at the very least, non-white that it is "hard to fix the image in my head that it's possible for folks that look like me to be badass fighters and wizards and so forth" that's the suffering it causes. It's changing our perceptions. Things that we won't even recognize unless someone not only holds a mirror up to our face, but also points out what's going on. Ignorance is the worst suffering there is.<br/><br/>It also causes people to wonder what could possibly be bad about depicting fictional characters almost entirely as one particular race (who then wonders why there's a lack of diversity in the hobby) and brings them to question doing otherwise. Instead of embracing a course that presents a fictional humanity in as diverse a manner as possible as being the natural course, it's challenged.  Funny how that works. I wonder what the root cause of that could be?<br/><br/>Edit: Could you not answer a question with a question next time?

Next time you want to shut down a discussion instead of participate in it, I'd prefer it if you did it somewhere else, so we can enjoy talking about roleplaying games in peace, instead of descending into a pointless flamewar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155355/#Comment_155355" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T07:33:27+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  7:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not touching the rest of Filip's comments (you're on yer own, pal), but he's got one point.

I'm not aiming this at you specifically, Jeff, but it's always possible to find fault.  Just like earlier someone (sorry, I'm too lazy to look to see exactly who it was) was saying "Oh it's insulting that a bunch of white guys are saying, 'We need to fix racism!'", it's almost always easy to find a problem.<br/>"It needs pictures of people that aren't white!"<br/>"Well, yeah, okay, but you've got them in European clothing, showing that they have been subjected to the cultural and militaristic imperialism of white Europeans!  Put them in indigenous clothing and in an indigenous setting!"<br/>"This is an inaccurate representation of these people's native culture!  How can you, as a European, possibly be so arogant as to assume you can understand and describe these cultures!"<br/><br/>So yeah.  As I type this I'm actually not sure what I'm really trying to say here.  Because I actually can understand ALL of those points.  It's tricky in areas like this, I think, to find the line being being respectful and just looking for fault.

That certainly would have painted a different outcome for the civil rights movement.  Again, we're back to the stance that somehow white people can't be held responsible.  I don't keep bringing this up because I like repeating myself.

There's a strong historical context for it, just as there would be for a tribal representation (of any culture, going far enough back in time). Your risk comes from, for instance, ONLY depicting Africans as "butlers and maids, slaves and hoes" (BDK and PE: still wise after all these years).<br/><br/>And that's the nut of the whole thread, I feel: did HAS/WOTC intentionally white-bread the art, to hit a demographic; or do they see no room for "heroes of color;" or did they just sort of randomly pick art from artists they commissions, with no thought at all? No one position is all that defensible, but only one of them is out-right "racist."<br/><br/>What to do? Write HAS/WOTC. Demand a refund of your books and don't buy another race- or gender-insensitive product from them. Stage a public book burning, where you get the local news to interview you about why you are spending good money to destroy something in protest.<br/><br/>Bitch on a web forum...?

When I had just one child and lots more time, I was involved in SCA. There was a decent number of non-white people who were deeply involved in the local SCA community. At least in my lily white neck of the woods, a fair number of non-whites enjoy classic medieval European dress-up and pretend.<br/><br/>The cover reminded me of a photo someone took of me in my Italian Renaissance working woman garb, dreadlocks loose (hot day, took of the head-dress) tattoos visible. My skin color was just fine for the garb. Dreadlocks and tattoos, not so much. <br/><br/>Point being, I am a woman of African descent who loves to dress up in medieval European garb, and the cover of the book spoke to me in a really good way. <br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm a non-white person who has avoided this thread and others like it like the plague.  My own past experiences of talking about racism and sexism on an internet forum have been largely frustrating and draining. I appreciate Graham's sentiment that perhaps this conversation would benefit from a non-white person's perspective. This conversation would benefit even more not being internet based.  There's just no good way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155480/#Comment_155480" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T14:17:36+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  2:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            White dude sinking the thread here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sean2099" title="sean2099"><img alt="sean2099" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sean2099">sean2099</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155501/#Comment_155501" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T16:18:48+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  4:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stirring up the pot some more and looking strictly at the U.S., groups that we think of as white weren't always considered that way.

Create characters that you'd like to see, the whole point is that imagination is the engine here not the pictures in the PH.<br/><br/>If you feel offended still after that apply for a job at Wizards.  Apply your will and opinions to the soloution.</blockquote>\nSo, the answer to lack of diversity is "Do it yourself!"? That certainly would have painted a different outcome for the civil rights movement.  Again, we're back to the stance that somehow white people can't be held responsible.  I don't keep bringing this up because I like repeating myself. I'm hoping maybe someone will address it without answering my question with a question.<br/><br/>So, one cannot do it one's self?  It is up to everyone else to do it for you?<br/><br/>Im not back to white people have nothing to do with it.  Im sure that Wizards has a ethnicly diverse staff.  who should be held responsible?  Only white people?<br/><br/>It should be up to the individule to change the world as they can.  Your arguement seems to say that an individule cannot make a differance.  I meant in my post that rather then arguing on the internet maybe some real actions could be taken.

It's like George Orwell said about Rudyard Kipling: his picture of British India is distorted and vulgar, but it's the only picture of that particular world that we have.<br/><br/>Where is the game of Mythic India or Heroic Africa or the Kingdom of the Khmers? If it gets written at all, it will probably get written by some white gamer guy. Is it better that nobody writes it at all? And I mean, who knows what a day in the life of a medieval <i>European</i> character is really like? <br/><br/>I find even the 'white' culture of standard fantasy to be bastardised and vulgarised, so I wouldn't at all be surprised to see the same treatment given to another culture (this is what I think of Lo5R, foe example). Right now I'm working on a little private project for a Maori game, and I know I'm going to get some shit wrong. If you really want to stretch it, my father's language (Malay) is distantly related to the Maori language, but basically I have no cultural connection to the Maoris, let alone the Maoris of four hundred years ago. But I'm fascinated by their shit, I like finding out about it and I'd love to play a game set there.<br/><br/>On my Anglo side, I'm not at all keen on most fantasy treatments, and my preference in medieval fantasy is in fact <i>Pendragon</i>. Now that was written by an American. Would it have been better if written by a Brit? Who knows? It's the best treatment of its subject matter out there for me. There sure isn't anything specfically Australian. In all of my roleplaying in an Australian (always modern) setting, I've always had to adjust for American cultural assumptions in the games I've used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156204/#Comment_156204" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T08:23:34+00:00" title="July 12, 2008  8:23AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>droog</cite>Where is the game of Mythic India or Heroic Africa or the Kingdom of the Khmers? If it gets written at all, it will probably get written by some white gamer guy. Is it better that nobody writes it at all? And I mean, who knows what a day in the life of a medieval European character is really like? <br/><br/>The reason that European fantasy worlds are the standard is simple.  The primary market for RPGs (as it exists today) is white, male and American.  This means a Europeanesque fantasy world has a number of advantages.  <br/><br/>First is accessability, Americans are far more familiar with pseudo-Europe than pseudo-Kampuchea so they will have to learn less about the culture to access play.  Note that accessing play is the key goal of an RPG.  Gamers want to play.  The more cannon they have to learn about a setting, the greater barrier to entry.  If your RPG is going to double as a text for Asian Studies 308: Khmer History and Culture, you're proposing a very steep barrier to entry, and consequent low sales.  While a hobby publisher could do a short run and not mind losing a little bit of cash, a business like WotC can't accept making losses for an ideological stand.  Case in Point: Al-Quadim was the worst selling campaign setting produced by TSR.  They lost more money on it than Planescape, and they sold Planescape at a loss (cost more to produce than the sale price.)<br/><br/>Second is identification.  Many gamers--far from all, nor even most, but a sizable minority at least--want to play a character that is like  an idealized vision of themselves.  That primarially white audience means that designers that want to sell to this group need to have Honkey as an option.  There are soime non-white individuals who are in this group, and most fantasy RPGs have a blurb about how any skin tone is a valid choice to placate them.<br/><br/>L5R is not about actual Samurai, but about a western fantasy about what Samurai were like.  It's nowhere near the reality of Feudal Japanese history, but it is accessable to American audiences.  We Americans have a passing, katana-fettishy familiarity with Japanese culture.  We have virtually no familiarity with Maori or Khmer culture, and asking players to learn in-depth about a culture prior to play will not succeed.<br/><br/>Oh, and American cultural assumptions are standard because America makes up more than 2/3 of the english-speaking market.  There are 15x more Americans than Australians.  Bigger audience, bigger sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156239/#Comment_156239" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T15:22:44+00:00" title="July 12, 2008  3:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds about right to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156696/#Comment_156696" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T12:16:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2008 12:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Herrozerro</cite>So, one cannot do it one's self?

Could you tell me where I suggest anything of the sort?  How is pointing out that all races need to be involved if we are to have any solutions off loading responsibility onto whites? What would make you jump to that conclusion? Is it the influence of white priviledge, or the indignation with the thought of being part of the problem? What evokes such a reaction?<br/><br/>I've never been to WotC, so I have no idea on their diversity. However, judging by the people who run booths at conventions, and the lack of diversity in video game development (a media with lots of cross influence, but a very diverse audience) I'm pretty sure that Wizards is not a diverse place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Salabra" title="Salabra"><img alt="Salabra" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Salabra">Salabra</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336483/#Comment_336483" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-30T20:20:04+00:00" title="July 30, 2011  8:20PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2011 10:29PM by Salabra.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, only three years too late on this one!<br/><br/>Mythic India? Heroic Africa? South and Central America? Try roleplaying in M.A.R. Barker\u2019s world of T\xe9kumel. The premise is this \u2014 in 2012, a global disaster (disease/nuclear war?) wipes out most of the European-descended groups on Earth. Those who survive are the peoples of Central and South America, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Eventually the descendants of these peoples make their way into space, meet several other alien \u2018races\u2019 (friendly and hostile) and terraform a planet called T\xe9kumel, confining the \u2018races\u2019 already there to reservations.<br/><br/>T\xe9kumel flourishes as a resort planet for several millennia before \u201csomething happens\u201d and T\xe9kumel is thrust into a time-space \u2018bubble\u2019 with a sun, two moons and four other planets. Over the next sixty thousand years, civilizations come and go until the \u2018present day\u2019 (in game terms). The \u2018human-zone\u2019 of the planet is divided into five large Empires (Livy\xe1nu, Mu\u2019ugalavy\xe1, Salarvy\xe1, Y\xe1n K\xf3r and Tsoly\xe1nu), ancient, powerful and tradition-bound, and several smaller states allied to the Empires.<br/><br/>There are no \u2018Caucasians [1]\u2019 on T\xe9kumel, no Nordic types, no blond(e)s or redheads. Albinos are considered to be \u2018freaks\u2019 \u2014 and, if someone looks at you with blue eyes, you throw stones at them, because they have been cursed by the goddess Av\xe1nthe and might \u2018infect\u2019 you with their bad luck.<br/><br/>Most PCs will be Tsoly\xe1ni, the main ethnic group in the Empire of Tsoly\xe1nu. Complexions range from golden tan to coppery brown. Men average 170cm in height and have what we would call slender/medium builds. Women tend to be several centimetres shorter and a little lighter in colouring, with rather voluptuous figures. Eyes range from dark brown to black. Hair is fine, straight and glossy black \u2014 few people have any body hair. <br/><br/>The peoples of the northern continent are all fairly similar to the Tsoly\xe1ni \u2014 the Livy\xe1ni are taller and more slender, the Y\xe1n Kory\xe1ni tend to bow-leggedness and the Salarvy\xe1ni are shorter with sallow complexions and copious body hair \u2014 with the exception of the N\u2019l\xfcss, who are about 30cm taller than the average Tsoly\xe1ni, and considerably more muscular. They are often employed as mercenaries and bodyguards (and playing a N\u2019l\xfcss means that you will be treated as a \u2018barbarian,\u2019 even if you are strong). <br/><br/>All Human Tekumely\xe1ni evince some degree of \u2018racism\u2019 (xenophobia and a sense of superiority to the citizens of cultures other than their own).<br/><br/>The traditional \u2018races\u2019 (Elves, Dwarves, Vampires etc.) are absent, though other intelligent beings exist (and many can be played) \u2014 e.g., the P\xe9 Ch\xf3i, insectoid creatures, the Sh\xe9n, reptilian warriors, the Tinal\xedya, clever little beings with the flaw of being totally literal-minded \u2014 but, while they are referred to as \u2018races\u2019 these beings are in fact different \u2018species [2].\u2019<br/><br/>And this is the problem with the term \u2018race\u2019 in RPGs. The Macquarie Dictionary (the Australian version of the OED lists twelve definitions of the word, the first five of which make up the general modern understanding of  the word (\u201ca sub-group of humanity that shows similar physical characteristics, thought to be inherited from a common ancestor\u201d). The sixth adds another commonly-held dimension \u2014 a shared culture (\u201cWe Greeks are a race of philosophers,\u201d etc etc \u2014 add your own stereotype). Yet \u2018race\u2019 also refers to humanity itself (Definition 7). At Definition 8, we find that in zoology, it can refer to a \u2018variety\u2019 within a species \u2014 a notion that is carried to extremes is such phrases as \u201csome male firefighters still regarded women as a race apart.\u201d Finally at Definition 9, we get to the RPG meaning of \u2018race\u2019 as \u201ca natural kind of living creature\u201d (\u201cthe race of birds/fish\u201d etc) \u2014 does this mean that the Uruk-hai pulled from the mud in the movie are not a \u2018race\u2019 because they are not produced naturally? [3]  <br/><br/>So, if one wanted to be simplistically literal, one could say that there is plenty of \u2018racial diversity\u2019 in RPGs (Human, Elves, Dwarves etc). However this is disingenuous \u2014 what most people who raise this concern want to see in their games is a greater proportion of non-North-western-European faces and bodies. This I applaud \u2014 I would also like to see a greater number of \u2018non-de-protagonized\u2019 women dressed appropriately, a greater variety of body-types and sexualities (T\xe9kumel has it all over most RPGs in this respect \u2014 \u2018alternative\u2019 sexualities are well-tolerated), religions that are not clones of/patterned on those that have existed in \u2018the West\u2019 (or China/Japan), different, even totally \u2018alien,\u2019 customs, clothing, architecture, militaria, legal systems etc.<br/><br/>Mind you \u2014 I won\u2019t expect everyone to get along, even if they are all of the same \u2018race\u2019 \u2026 certainly, as Graham has pointed out somewhere, the inhabitants of the UK often don\u2019t!<br/>_______________________<br/><br/>[1] This term which originally referred to a geographical area and the languages spoken therein was turned into a racial descriptor denoting a broad group of peoples from Europe, western Asia, and parts of India and North Africa (it is now used to mean \u201cwhite-skinned, of European origin\u201d) by the German physiologist Blumenbach who believed that these peoples originated in the Caucasus region of SE Europe.<br/>We now know that humanity originated in Africa and that different \u2018racial\u2019 characteristics evolved in response to different conditions elsewhere. Yet the term \u2018Caucasian\u2019 is still used as a racial descriptor, especially in the US, not least because it feeds into the commitment by many \u2014 especially white \u2014 USans to biblical literalism (Mt Ararat, on which Noah\u2019s Ark is supposed to have landed, is commonly thought to have been somewhere in the Caucasus) and thus to the notion of their own \u2018Exceptionalism.\u2019<br/><br/>[2] Roughly speaking, in modern biology, if two creatures cannot naturally mate and produce fertile offspring they are regarded as members of different species. In Tolkien &amp; traditional D&amp;D, only Humans and Elves seem able to \u2018intermarry\u2019 (Humans and Hobbits cannot \u2013 or maybe they choose not to) \u2014 the half-Orcs of modern D&amp;D-type games are a concession to the twelve-year-old male gamer\u2019s taste for vicarious rape-porn. <br/><br/>[3] FWIW, I agree with Trotsky, when, speaking of the Nazis, he said that \u201ctheir notion of race appears as if unearthed from a mediaeval graveyard.\u201d The term is meaningless \u2014 we are all mutts, mongrels, mixtures \u2014 and is such a red flag that it should be done away with. When I am asked my \u2018race,\u2019 I reply without hesitation \u2018human.\u2019\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: King Turnip</cite><cite>droog</cite>  [Yada, yada, yada...]<br/><br/>Oh, and American cultural assumptions are standard because America makes up more than 2/3 of the english-speaking market.
