There were 38 games tagged as Indie Hurricane, which seemed like most of the non-RPGA RPGs! They mostly shared a 7-table conference room which was noisy at times, but not Gen Con 15-table level noisy.<br/><br/>The highpoints for me were running <em>Lacuna</em> Saturday afternoon, and spending 3 hours Saturday night talking about gaming with Rob H, Jonathan T, Willem L (who has some fascinating ideas on <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/2009/03/30/the-pedagogy-of-play-bite-sized-pieces-part-iv/" rel="nofollow">teaching RPGs</a>, which he employed very successfully in his two 10am Polaris games) and Mike S.<br/><br/>All the Thursday games were held in one huge hall (which became the dealer's room Friday-Sunday) but I listened to a bit of Andrew Henderson's "The Trail of Sky and Fire" which adapted Vincent Baker's game-in-progress "Storming the Wizard's Tower" to a pre-contact Blackfoot Indian setting. Yay for cultural appropriation! His variant setting interested me a lot more than the more common fantasy settings. I only saw parts of it, but my favorite part was right at the end, where Joe McDonald's aging war leader, having rescued the little girl but once again been denied a glorious death, sent everyone else back to camp ahead of himself and donned the skinshifter's wolfskin to become a terrible beast, so that future generations of warriors would have a foe to test their bravery against.<br/><br/>Afterwards there was interesting discussion of GMing techniques, trad and new, before folks drove off to Portland for dinner.<br/><br/>I also watched a little of Jake Richmond's playtest of Ocean, his upcoming survival horror game, which I found interesting. The way he distributes narration rights isn't to my taste, but that's me. I plan to buy a copy when it comes out.<br/><br/>Friday 6pm I ran <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> for 3 people, in which Jackson T's eco-friendly meth dealer traded for the end of civilization with a High School Girl (who got an A- ), Joe McDonald's poet lost his love and sestinas to Mother When but gained the blood of Odin elsewhere, and Willem's found artist struck a deal with the Wax King to trade 100 people for the return of 8 dead friends. Also, couch surfing and rising property values.<br/><br/>Saturday 10am I ran <em>Summerland</em> (for the first time) for two teen boys, who had fun and did pretty well. They rescued the girl chased by wolves, drove off the feral humans who crept up on them in the night, delivered the medicine to the town in time to save the plague-stricken children, backtracked the strange humming roaring noise to rescue two drifters from the feral humans, and convinced a few grateful townfolk, plus the girl and other two drifters, to help them scout a path to the ocean, with an eventual vision of burning a path there that could be traversed safely without the call of the forest that doomed ordinary folk who slept overnight in the woods. They each called on their trauma once, to good effect. There was no bear-fighting, but there was a bit of brother-killing.<br/><br/>All that in only two hours. Sadly, the Summerland mechanics seemed very failure-heavy. Possibly they'll work better if I can come up with more interesting consequences for failure, but an average person (which the PCs are, other than their ability to sleep overnight in the Sea of Leaves due to their trauma drowning out the Call of The Forest) has only about a 10% chance of accomplishing a difficult task. So characters are either going to specialize and always try to accomplish things using the one thing they're built for ("We must solve this problem with QUILLS!") or have to eat a lot of dust. That may be OK anyway when running with more of a horror or mystery feel, which I'd prefer over action adventure anyway, although this run wound up being more action adventure.<br/><br/>I still love the setting, and am musing over Dogs in the Forest.<br/><br/>(Suggested reading for Summerland GMs: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bones-Faerie-Janni-Lee-Simner/dp/0375845631/" rel="nofollow"><em>Bones of Faerie</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forest-Hands-Teeth-Carrie-Ryan/dp/0385736819/" rel="nofollow"><em>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</em></a>).<br/><br/>I totally forgot about Earth Hour when it came around at 8:30pm Saturday, but I had no lights turned on so I'll claim that counts as observance. I had used it earlier for the kick off point in Summerland, explaining that the Sea of Leaves had started the return of the Forest during Earth Hour, when everyone turned off their lights and they didn't turn back on, and the next day all the trees were back.<br/><br/>I watched a bit of a panel that reminded me once again that unless tightly moderated, panels tend toward general and abstract, and audiences crave concrete and specific. Ah well, we still have the Internet.<br/><br/>(continued in next post...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199751/#Comment_199751" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T13:50:42+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  1:50PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Part 2 of 2)<br/><br/>Saturday 4-8pm I ran <em>Lacuna part 1, The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)</em>. Michael P had read it but never played, the other 3 (Kamala W, Kevin C, Jim C) had neither read nor played, so they opted for "The Full Lacuna Experience" (as everyone so far has), starting with nothing on the table but their character sheet, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> pencil, and dice. Details are not available in the public record, but it went marvelously well, they were extremely clever, and for a change none of the four mystery agents died, although two came very close and it was a very tense ending. Final heart rates were 211, 183, 161, 155. 13 Commendations. 13 [redacted]. Now that it's back in print, Lacuna may be close to edging out DRYH as my current favorite game. Everyone should play Lacuna before reading it.<br/><br/>I also want to try adapting Lacuna to run "Push" (the recent movie about psychics fighting in Hong Kong, based on the comic book, or vice versa). (And also adapting it to run Shadowrun, it goes without saying.)<br/><br/>Saturday evening 9 to midnight was a glorious discussion of the sort not seen since, well, a 10pm to 4am chat at Go Play NW last year. <br/><br/>Sunday (10am again!) I watched Willem run Montsegur 1244 long enough to get an idea of it. I bought a copy at Endgame on my way home from the airport, along with MSG. Actual play sells games.<br/><br/>I talked with Joe McDonald a bit about Perfect 2.0 (Perfecter?), which I liked the sound of, and we lunched on delicious gumbo and hush puppies at Gumbo Goddess in the Farmer's Market adjacent to the Vancouver Hilton. If I'd known how good it was I would have eaten there Saturday too. On our way back to the hotel there was a bit of sleet, but only a bit.<br/><br/>Then I sat around the Indie Hurricane booth and chatted a bit on what may become Ogre Marco's 90-minute episode 24 of his podcast <a href="http://stabbingcontest.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Stabbing Contest</a>, with various other guests coming and going. There was actual play of <em>The Adventure of Lucky Pip and the Incomparable Ithamar Conchie</em>, which uses fortune cookies.<br/><br/>Ogre had a good question: What games would you like to run for their creator? After a bit of brain freeze I came up with my obvious answer: DRYH for Fred Hicks.<br/><br/>Then I watched a game of Sea Dracula which was much the sort of thing it was, and the con was over. Everyone vanished off to home or the road or dinner, and I went for a walk and caught up on email.<br/><br/>I bought the ashcan of Magical Land of Yeld (and saw a demo in which brave kids made a monster cry) and the preview of Cannibal Contagion, and on the way home from the airport I stopped off at <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">Endgame Oakland</a> (whose minicon I'd missed Saturday) and bought Montsegur 1244 and MSG&amp;#0153; and read them while waiting for traffic to cool off. I can't believe MSG&amp;#0153; left Scott Westerfeld's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/So-Yesterday-Scott-Westerfeld/dp/1595140328/" rel="nofollow"><em>So Yesterday</em></a> off its list of references but I'm looking forward to running it sometime.<br/><br/>I'll think about coming back next year, and it it definitely whetted my appetite for Go Play NW in 3 months.<br/><br/>(So that's 3 of 38 games, how were the others?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199783/#Comment_199783" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T15:15:46+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  3:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Various commitments kept me from participating in GameStorm as heavily as I intend to do at, say, GPNW, but I was surprised and happy to find it a very successful con.<br/><br/>Joe McDonald came into town a day early and ran Ribbon Drive for me, Matthew Gagan and Nick Smith at my place.  Joe claims this was one of his less successful playtests, and I know a couple of us weren't satisfied with the characters we brought to the table.  I had a good time, though, and the game had a distinctly cinematic feel--well worth the prep of putting together a mix CD.<br/><br/>My first game was the Thursday-night playtest of Ocean that Carl mentioned above.  I agree that its distribution of narrative power is a lot floatier than most of the games I'm used to, because most of the games I'm used to measure success in terms of narrative control and have very specific mechanics to parse it out.  Ocean is much closer to long-form improv, sort of a "yes-and" feel rather than "but-only-if."  We had six players, if I recall correctly, and managed to produce a pretty cool and cohesive story about squid parasites, engineered monsters, mutant clones and the horror of identity.<br/><br/>After that game, a bunch of us milled around for a couple of hours and eventually caravanned to Roxy's diner in downtown Portland.  Said milling and diner conversation culminated in the birth of Kiss A Dude, about which the more said the better.<br/><br/>The aforementioned commitments (this one to my podcast) forced me to skip Nick's game of Classroom Deathmatch (for which I had signed up and everything) on Friday night.  Nick, I am still sorry and I'll buy you pizza if you run it for me again sometime.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I played in Joe's new version of Perfect, which was so great that I wouldn't let Joe keep my character sheet afterward.  I played Wester de Card, architect and subterranean city explorer who got caught and conditioned so often that it drove him to become a heartless, claustrophobic, clock-hating mad bomber.  All the players lost most of our tests in that game, which I actually think made sense--in a perfect Victorian dystopia, you should have to take a few knocks before you start to become an effective criminal.  Joe would end up dialing back his own oppositional points a bit for the next game (I sat in on the end of that), which led to the players <i>winning</i> all their tests.  Numerical balance is difficult!<br/><br/>On Sunday I played in Travis Brown's game of The Magical Land of Yeld.  I loved the Final Fantasy Tactics feel, especially once the battle grid / chessboard came out, although I felt the game started off a bit slow as we ran through the story of our kids falling into Yeld through an old tire and figuring out where we were.  I did have fun playing a character with the archetype "Princess," though.<br/><br/>I should also mention that on Saturday and Sunday I ran playtests with the new, Tony Dowler-designed map for my board game, Atlantis Rising.  I think both went pretty well!  We learned very quickly that dry-erase marker is by no means opaque, and I'm going to have to go to print with a pretty washed-out map instead of the vibrant colors I was trying.  Thanks to my playtesters.<br/><br/>The final game of Sunday, and indeed of the con, was Sea Dracula.  It was my first game, and apparently the session we played resembled trad Sea Dracula in very few ways, but I think the audience appreciated our performance.  Joe, myself and two other brave congoers were the lawyers, with a surprise stunt casting of Jackson at the last minute, and the winners of the previous game played the judge and the bailiff.  Witnesses called included Nick's haircut, Octomom's evil twin, a pair of loafers and the prosecution.  Pants were removed.  I have a giraffe that says "Most Erotic" on it.  It was a good game.<br/><br/>A bunch of Go Play PDXers got together afterward and descended like, well, an indie hurricane on a Lebanese restaurant in Portland, where Travis kindly (and to our startlement) covered the entire tab.  A shrinking subset of that group came back to my place, at first with the intent of further Ribbon Drive, although we ended up just playing one game of Pandemic and then keeping my girlfriend up with our conversation until 1 in the morning.<br/><br/>Regarding Carl's sentiment about GPNW and appetites:  seconded!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199796/#Comment_199796" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T16:00:51+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  4:00PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 4:02PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thoroughly enjoyed Gamestorm this year.  Probably because I went less as a designer and more as a player.<br/><br/>On Friday, I spontaneously dropped into a Classroom Deathmatch game.  Maybe the one you missed out on, Brendan <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I stayed long enough to kill two students and then sacrifice myself after my unrequited love died.<br/><br/>After that, Lesley ran <i>Beast Hunters</i> for myself, Lukas, Andy and David.  Man, that was so much fun!  I got to play my own game with a bunch of awesomely creative Stepper-Uppers.  Lesley had actually pulled a very cool tidbit out of the background--the tribespeople who went to war against the foreign empire against the will of the Elders and who were therefore exiled--to create a tough situation for us.  Well, I'm sure she thought it was going to be, "do we accept them back or kill them?"  But for us true Chelqhuri, it was more "Do we wipe them out now or save our strength for the evil defiling water witch and kill them out later?"  Our game ran overtime by quite a bit, and sad to say that made me miss Sea Dracula, but boy was that worth it.<br/><br/>That night, Joe and Jackson introduced me to Everyone Fighter, and despite not using the old dodge-attack-dodge-dodge-attack, I won!<br/><br/>I had decided to run games on demand on Saturday, and I'd brought everything from Sorcerer to Dread:TFBOP, but demand was low.  There just weren't many people who came to the booth, and when I offered demos, people didn't have time.  So we played <i>Magical Land of Yeld</i> for five or so hours; that's the game Carl watched.  Brendan, I was a Princess too! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  A male one.  With dark magic.  Who inflicted Scary Face and Fire Hat left and right!  (Not to mention the occasional exploding tricycle.)  That was good fun.  The action chain rules with the Excuse Me! interrupting initiative mechanic are golden.  And Ogre even brought me a Bratwurst from the farmer's market!<br/><br/>Afterward, Jackson and I went to play Street Fighter IV on the PS3 upstairs before he had to go to his next game.  Gabe had signed up for the SFIV tournament shortly thereafter, so I decided to join in, despite this being the first time I ever played the game.  The next three hours were wonderfully intense, in that full-blown geek challenge sort of way.  We cheered, groaned, applauded, and kicked each other's asses.  And I ended up in 3rd place (out of 8 players, I think).  Sagat FTW!<br/><br/>Back to roleplaying: Andy ran <i>Anima Prime</i> for myself, Jackson, Joe, and David.  Mike was burned out and had to bow out, which was sad.  But that game, too, was wonderful.  Not only did we have all sorts of fun with our stunt actions on top of a crashing airship, but Jackson and my characters, sisters who'd lost their mother, had a character flashback scene that was more touching than I had expected.  And the distrust between the winged Blacktips and the Raccoon-Man Spookytail was immensely entertaining <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I'm hoping that we'll continue this game at some point, because there was a huge amount of potential in there.<br/><br/>The best part of it all was seeing and hugging some old friends and making new ones.  But the gaming, man, that was great too.

Sounds like you had a pretty wicked time, which is cool! Sounds like the Con was a blast!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the diffculties of player actions, I deliberately set the power level of the game pretty low - this suits my impression of the setting, and encourages players to make use of help (to increase their score), appropriate tools (to reduce the difficulty and number of dice rolled) and their traumas (which again reduces the number of dice rolled). The traumas drive the story, so involving them is a key part of the game. Saying that, if you want to increase the power level of the game, you just need to review the difficulties of actions and conflicts in that light. For example, beating off a feral man might be 'difficult (3 dice)' for a normal human, but for a more heroic human you could set the difficulty as 'routine ( 2 dice)'. The difficulty reflects the tools, situation, and abilities of the participants - if you imagine the participants in a more heroic light, then the tasks all become just a little easier to accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for playing the game and I'm glad you had fun, let me know if you have another game! <br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200181/#Comment_200181" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T14:20:59+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  2:20PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2009 2:26PM by jackson_tegu.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, what a great weekend!<br/><br/>High moments for me included looking at all the new goodies at the Indie Hurricane booth &amp; hanging out there, feeling like one of the cool kids, eventually playing some mean "Magical Land Of Yeld", run beautifully by Nick. a great moment from that: prissy princess Percy (Christian), my bratty cousin Peter (Ogre) and... can't remember Andy's character's name... anyway, we're told to go off and find Lord Dragul. "go that way". so we come to a graveyard, eventually, and there's a big scary house with a lit-up sign on top which reads "House Of Dragul". ah. so we go in, and there's a huge dragon and a tiny bat inside, and the dragon proclaims "I AM FAKE DRAGUL!!!" <br/>God that was hilarious. Video game logic ported over to rpgs is really silly and fun.<br/><br/>&amp; the moment when Willem's DRYH character was at the bottom of the stairs looking back and forth between the creepy kid asking to be let in on the front porch and the barely visible socked foot poking out of a room at the top of the stairs... the room where 20 of his friends lay dead from bad meth. that was such a good moment, as that willem's character was a) without sleep for a week, b) on meth, and c) thinking he was dreaming the whole time. such a great moment. "the horror".<br/><br/>the three games that were totally vital &amp; i'm super glad i got the opportunity to play were (in no order) <br/><br/>Ribbon Drive: with joe, gilbert, david, and mike. As every time i've played this game, it was hugely moving- all of my co-players really rose to the occasion, and i was constantly being bombarded with awesome lines, insight into characters' internal worlds, and bittersweet truths about strength and frailty. Weird choice for friday morning, afterwards i was like, "cool, my work is done for the day. guess i'll just go relax somewhere."<br/><br/>Anima Prime: oh my god, this game is so fun! played with christian, david again, joe again, with andy running it (oh yeah, remember GMed games?) fuck, it was so awesome. we had dedicated ourselves to being pretty "cute", and when joe had jumped up into the storm clouds which were full of black-armor-wearing flying apes to tie them together so that they couldn't bother us as easily... christian's "Cassie" (my character's little sister) said "Oh, what's that Spooky-Tail up to, the rascal?" <br/>comedy gold.<br/>this game is very cinematic, and lends itself to very beautiful moments, oh, when david introduced his weapon - a lance made of lightning - i was actually made speechless. which was good, as that he was meant to be describing, and not i.<br/><br/>Monsegur 1244: spelling be damned, this was an awesome game. too much happened to even relate the details. this is going on my must-play list; willem did a great job presenting it, and many beautiful moments were shared between he, zack, julian, johno, tyler, joshua and myself. <br/>what julian set the groundwork for, and how johno supported that, was one of my best moments of the weekend. <br/><br/>it's such a wonder how brilliant we are.<br/><br/>and sea dracula was wonderful, and it was excellent walking up to the "QuickLazer" in the middle of the night, though we decided not to get any missions. everything was just great. thanks especially to travis and jake, but everyone i gamed with was awesome.<br/><br/>total played:<br/><br/>Storming the Wizard's Tower: Trail of Sky and Fire<br/>Kiss A Dude<br/>Ribbon Drive<br/>DRYH<br/>Everyone Fighter (not as a player though, as a fighter)<br/>Adrift<br/>Magical Land Of Yeld<br/>Street Fighter 4<br/>Dirty Secrets<br/>The Incomparable Adventures of the Lucky Pip and his Companion the wise Ithamar Quonckie (or... however you say)<br/>Monsegur 1244<br/>Brendan's Atlantis Game<br/>Sea Dracula (i started off as a jury member, but after one of the prosecution threw a party and i danced, i gave myself a lawyer point, too. so then i figured i was kind of playing. so i went and say with the prosecution, and the honorable judge julian allowed it! so that was nice.)<br/><br/><br/>i am now kind of recovered from the sleep deprivation party that was Game Storm Indie Hurricane 2011. i don't know why they called it that.<br/>i haven't even thought about rpgs barely at all the last few days, the itch was scratched so completely. i'd better start though, 'cause i've got a new<br/>game starting tonight!<br/><br/><br/>BATTLE CRY!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200185/#Comment_200185" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T14:33:46+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  2:33PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ribbon Drive was interesting but the late hour definitely robbed some of its potential for me.

I don't think I quite did MSG(tm) justice, however, so I'd be really interested to see what Carl does with it.  I really liked the setting, but I just couldn't grok the strategy of the bidding mechanics and I think it derailed our game.  My only other regret is that I also wanted to run a Saturday morning game of Dirty Secrets, but I was staying in Gresham, which was about a two hour trip via public transportation to the convention site and there was no way I was getting up at 7 AM after not having gotten to bed until 4 AM.  Perhaps I will give it a go next time I get a chance to run a game.  Anyway, it was a fantastic time and I can't wait until the next time I come up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200207/#Comment_200207" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T15:43:37+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  3:43PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My report: http://ogremarco.livejournal.com/531279.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael, your Shock game was the best of the weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200254/#Comment_200254" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T19:57:44+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  7:57PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I'd also like to formally announce that I, having beat Joe McDonald at Everyone Fighter, am retiring undefeated.</blockquote>\nNot to take away from your victory, but I get the impression that Joe takes a dive in this game to promote it.

Everyone got to do fun stuff that they enjoyed, including the griefer, and his teenage pal was actually great to play with.</li>\n<li>Then a Star Wars-themed Solar System game based on the Skywalker Paradigm. The players took the Paradigm's premises (the films are propaganda, the Rebels are Royalist douchebags, Vader's a hardass but a hero) and cranked them up to 9000--resulting in a mass-murdering Leia, an unhinged thrill-junkie Luke, a scheming, pupil-sacrificing Obi-Wan, and a Vader who brutally triumphed over them all. Good times!</li>\n<li>And finally, I ran a playtest of my Game Chef 2008 entry, Spectre of the Beast--the game about progress and bloodshed in human history. Though I only had one player, it went well! I was a humanitarian inventor whose scheme to partner with a manufacturing company to spread fish-boning machines to proud traditional islanders ended in tears. Nick was an heir to a railroad empire trying to span his vast nation with a grand railway, over the bodies of obstructive gypsies if necessary. We figured a whole bunch of stuff out about the game, and we had lots of fun. And while we didn't manage to draw any more players, I sold several ashcans just pitching the game when folks wandered by. And I made cost for my (tiny) print run. Score!</li>\n</ul>\nGames I played in:\n<ul>\n<li>Storming the Wizard's Tower: Sweet game! I only got a taste, but it's robust and flexible. I would've liked to see the elements of social and cultural grounding come into play more, but it <i>was</i> a con game. I had a sword like a slab and steel in my jaw. . .and got totally flattened by a giant wendigo-beast! I mean, no contest, man. Seems the game's hard to balance for only two players. </li>\n<li>Sea Dracula! This was epic as always. And not just any kind of epic: this was Sea Dracula vs. the Planet of the Apes! I was a proud Bull Lawyer with a right and proper aversion to Orange. I spent a lot of time snorting, pawing and braying at rampant anti-Bovine prejudice infecting the Court. There was a competitive lap dance (we each took half a lap) complete with tie-breaking round. I think I won but it's kind of a pelvis-undulating blur.</li>\n<li>Perfect: Joe McDonald's Victrorian Dystopia game is awesome. Easy to get on board with and play fluidly. I was a sick vigilante somewhere between Rorschach and Doctor gull, but the stuff I really grooved on was the Romantic whlo hoarded forbidden poems and recited them to his Noblewoman crush, and the quasi-marxist laborer who first manufactured engineering books and later (when conditioned against that), <i>munitiuons</i>. My favorite bits were the Conditioning scenes, where the Inspectors try to brainwash you against repeating your crime. Conditioning the Poet to be unable to read was fucked-up and sweet.</li>\n<li>Shab Al-Hiri Roach! That's right, I finally lost my Roachginity! It was awesome; we had a lurid and audacious Professor of Cryptomythology who willingly took the Roach at the beginning and never gave it up, becoming the King of an empire of Roach Thralls that eventually engulfed the world. That guy was a ball of scenery-chewing awesome. I was a sensitive, soulful Asst. Professor of Choir and Composition who discovered an unearthly music of haunting beauty under the Roach's thrall, and after escaping it tried--in vain, to use the music's eerie strains to call the Roach's slaves back to humanity. A bit of Erich Zann in there that I was proud of. Such fun! Thanks Jason Morningstar! And thanks Zach Greenvoss!</li>\n<li>Sea Dracula again! This time I wasn't a lawyer but I tried my best to steal the show by playing a transsexual on the witness stand. But it's not easy to steal a show from Joe McDonald (Powerdog Powerfox!) and Brendan Adkins! They both performed admirably in the Pants Off Dance Off! but only Brendan was man enough to remain that way for the length of the game. Bravo, sir! And bravo to the other gentleman (Lying Wolf!) who rocked the Boss Fight Dance Trifecta: 1) Latent Homoeroticism 2) Blatant Homoeroticism and 3) Lawful Homoeroticism! Apparently the last one involves handcuffs.</li>\n</ul>\nThanks everyone at Gamestorm, and especially from you folks who came down from Olympia and B.C. (And began the drive back there at 2AM!) Good times, and I'm glad to have met and/or played with you all. it almost makes up for having to miss GPNW <i>again.</i> :P<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS No, you prudes, Sea Dracula doesn't <i>have</i> to be homoerotic.<br/><br/><br/>It's only homoerotic if you do it <i>right.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
