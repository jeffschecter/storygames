We're all really proud of her and think she's very brave for walking out on the Dread Lord and abandoning the path of evil.  Of course there's a hitch \u2014 she's been a public figure for so long, her name and face are indelibly inked in the people's consciousness.  Add to that, she's sort of hell-bent on joining that damned Coalition of Light and taking down the Dread Lord once and for all, so simply hiding her in some far-flung frontier province isn't an option.<br/><br/>She's been talking to some of the small gods and eldritch powers, trying to find a way to abandon her old identity.  However, she's run into a bit of a snag.  Harkun the Stormlord will scour her old persona into something new at the cost of her memories, but then she wouldn't remember her reasons for fighting the Dread Lord.  On the other hand, Anstass Willow-Breaker will give her a total body reshaping, but wants her voice in exchange, and without her voice, there will be no summoning of spirits of air and darkness against her ex.  She knows better than any of us that no great work of magic comes without a price, but the prices she's finding are not just inconvenient, they're counter-productive.<br/><br/>So she asked me to go online and do a little comparative shopping.  Does anybody have some leads on fresh identities at a price that won't interfere with my sister's revenge plans?<br/><br/>Thanks so much!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202847/#Comment_202847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T17:54:29+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  5:54PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My old master, the Deflord Barg, can arrange for her old identity to be forgotten by everyone except her.

If she's a shrinking violet forget it, but if she can man up for a while I can hook you up.<br/><br/>I know this guy - he's a big guy, well-connected, pretty powerful.  An aspect of both Xipe Totec and Tezcatlipoca, goes by the name Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca, maybe you've heard of him?  He's got a place in Simi Valley for what it's worth.  <i>Anyway</i>, he's pretty badass in the magic department and can do the transformational thing.  He's always turning his priests into jaguars and vice-versa.  He could change your sister's appearance without messing with her <i>at all.</i>  That's the good part.  The bad part is he's one of those Aztec blood Gods, you know?  He needs "appeasement" on Tlacaxipehualiztli, the spring equinox.  It's pretty old school, but your sister's got time to find another good-looking lady to bring him next March.  She'll need to flay her intended alive and wear the still-bloody skin to meet Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca, who can then do the magic thing and make the new skin permanent, you know?  It is totally boss - I've seen it a dozen times and it never fails to impress.  He gets his sacrifice, your sister gets a new identity, everybody wins.  Well, <i>almost </i>everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202854/#Comment_202854" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T18:08:59+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  6:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we here at The Library can do the whole new identity thing.

Were I in her shoes I'd just try to vamp one of those Coalition of Light dudes; they're all suckers for sob stories, I can't see them not helping her get her makeover if she'll show a bit of cleavage at the right sort of austere missionary. In fact, I know just the guy; if she doesn't mind becoming a "mail order bride" and learning Latin, I'll take care of the introductions. Some sort of transcendance deal with wings, hair bleach and boobjob, I imagine, nobody'll recognize her for all the glitter. Of course, afterwards she's stuck in an exploitative relationship with a middle-aged virgin, and those holier-than-thou types are all jerks (if I'm allowed to have an opinion, you know). And she'll have to "love" him until death does its part. Might be too harsh a price, in fact, all things considered.<br/><br/>A left-field idea - and I don't know anybody can swing this personally, mind, but I understand there are some westcoast guys on these forums who do - would be to go to the feds and get them to deal her a new passport, cosmetic surgery and some of those CSI wiz to clean the databases and her apartment. You know the MiBs could do it if they want to, last time I was in your country I never saw a fairy didn't fear their cold iron protocols. And yes, I do readily confess that this might not save her from whatever voodoo you're afraid of, but compared to some of those offers (like, my mind? no thanks) I'm sure your friendly neighbourhood government will be completely reasonable about it. And really, I doubt even that Court of Pestilence thing knows <i>exactly</i> what the MiBs can and can't do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202864/#Comment_202864" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T20:42:29+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  8:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if your sister's hot, she can come hook up with me and I'll knock off that pesky Dread Lord for her next weekend, then we can do the happily ever after thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202865/#Comment_202865" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T20:47:40+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  8:47PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those wondering, Ralph wasn't the guy I had in mind, above.

Apparently they immerse you in their sacred pool and take away your name. Then you study with them in complete silence for a year (your sister's not in a hurry or anything?). After that, they give you a new name and send you out into the world. What between the head-shaving and the restrictive diet, your appearance is usually quite altered. (From what I hear, your sister has, let's say, a bit of room to maneuver there. Especially round the hips.) <br/><br/>Their program of meditation is supposed to give you a completely new personality, too. And all you have to do from then on is meditate morning and night, keep silent on Tuesdays, fast at the New Moon, and give away a tenth of your possessions every Winter Solstice. <br/><br/>Oh, and I believe there's a tattoo.

That's because of the devastating effect they have on the human body, naturally.  Marikot, in particular, is highly efficacious after only a handful of doses (taken just beneath the lower eyelid, by injection).  It tends to stain the eyes as black as night and leave the skin a deep shade of eggplant, as well as causing the nose and cheeks to sink in a bit, which is only natural since the drug is harvested from certain demons in one of the unfashionable circles of hell.  I've been told that some people find the appearance quite becoming.  However, her voice is going to get a bit huskier.  Do the spirits of the air really mind?<br/><br/>It does have certain psychological side effects, which you might consider a plus, since they tweak the personality a little.  She'll be a little more irritable, and desire warm blood with every meal (but this is only so that she doesn't die of malnutrition, which I suppose isn't really a psychological problem).<br/><br/>The downside is, of course, addiction and a distinctly different appearance.  Marikot dealers are also prone extracting ridiculous prices for the drug once the addict starts "showing", since by then they're generally hooked for life.  Users are also sterile (mercifully), and somewhat light-sensitive.  Many of the worst side effects can be remedied by quitting the drug, a process which is is only fatal about half the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
