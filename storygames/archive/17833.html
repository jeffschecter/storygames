We cut them out, sleeved them (with an old L5R CCG card) into three colors of backed sleeves, each color representing Brutality (Blue), Demonology (Grey) or Investigation (Lavender). People called out the kind of spell they wanted ("Give me 4 Brutality and 2 Demonology"), and got their spells randomly.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YK4V9UoFqb8/UPI-sZnKW1I/AAAAAAAAGpY/8xsMRY0WyGs/s912/scorncards.jpg"/><br/><br/>This helps immensely in a demo or first game, because the single point of character generation in Scorn that takes the longest is choosing spells. There's a real analysis paralysis as you look through each of the 30 spells per attribute (90 total) considering what you want. Now you can just grab them. If you have something you really don't like, no one's going to have a problem with you discarding and drawing a new one.<br/><br/>Note: The cards are from the existing version of the playtest rules for Scorn, freely available (follow my G+ link above back to the source); in between the conversion from Dread to Scorn, we noticed that most of the cards awesome flavor text (which is all on the spell cards too!) often refers to the previous name that spell had in the earlier version of the game. There was a tiny bit of confusion, but just get over it, it makes sense otherwise.<br/><br/>Now, I said that it was 95% awesome. Here's a player's character sheet and all their abilities, all in one place:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YPr43j3D5YI/UPI-uCkpgzI/AAAAAAAAGp0/WpynoFs_3TI/s912/scornchar.jpg"/><br/><br/>The only problem is that there's a lot of Things In Front Of You, so it's actually perhaps a little distracting, as you might not know where to focus.<br/><br/>So if I use these cards at a demo (and oh man I will!), the only thing I'd change is to put the attributes, name, decay, skills, and weapons (perhaps drive, too) on an organized small-form character sheet.<br/><br/>Everything else, though, including:<br/>Stunts<br/>Spells<br/>Civilians (YES! How hardcore is it to have it so that if your Civilian dies, you have to tear the card in half yourself)<br/>and MAYBE drive<br/>...would be put on cards.<br/><br/>Blood (the "hit points") is represented by chips: Reds (5s) and Blues (1s).<br/><br/>I like the idea of having your entire character fit in like 15 cards that can go in your pocket, but a sheet will help keep focus, I think. Maybe the sheet could be folded down to a CCG card size, though, for easy storage... Hmmm...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mJrIDq4F89Y/UPI-uKq2TgI/AAAAAAAAGpw/WvgqEy1FNKs/s1024/scorngmkit.jpg"/><br/><br/>The above is what I had in front of me to reference as a GM:<br/>* One note card with my session plan, notes, and lots of meaningless doodles<br/>* A LAMY fountain pen<br/>* A set of Chessex d12s in the "Stealth" color scheme<br/>* The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Guns. It's basically the Story Games Names Book, but for Guns instead of Names.<br/><br/>Enjoy! Give this game a shot if you can, it's one of my favorites!

Looking at your GM card makes me wonder: how simple is it to prep for a game? How simple is it to run it?

Think of a group of people who are wittingly or unwittingly also causing trouble (mafia, skinheads, hippies, etc)<br/><br/>3) Follow the clearly laid-out steps for creation of scenes (basically think of cool places to put clues, cool places to have fights).<br/><br/>4) That's about it.<br/><br/>Check out that link up there to the free download of Scorn over on RPGNow. It needs editing still, but as is it is seriously the best version of the game yet. <br/><br/>I'm still a little iffy on the change in Drive from "central motivation of your character" to "a cool scene you want to see", but I'm giving it a shot. Also, I'm still a big pusher on War-Ghoul-Centric games (where many/most of the PCs are War Ghouls, the classic "Dread Disciple"), but yeah it's really, really good. Evocative as ever. And really easy to set up and run.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403640/#Comment_403640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T00:33:28+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 12:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 12:33AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent news! Just downloaded it: it's bad-ass. I love the 'Bloody Monday' event that kicks off the whole situation; the Death Spiral looks like a good tool, and Drives as cool scenes would give me a lot to work with as a GM. I have a few friends who will probably want to play this.<br/><br/>What's your feeling on how long combats take to play out (in real time)? Like, if you had a player who was new to the game, are all the decisions, dice-rolling and calculations involved in a round of combat pretty intuitive? How long does one person's turn usually take?<br/><br/>And if you had 3 Disciples teaming up to kill a tough demon (one that definitely needs all three of them to take it down), how long do you reckon that combat would take to play out?<br/><br/>(Just trying to get a feel for how fast the game moves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403710/#Comment_403710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T21:58:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  9:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. One round of combat typically takes about 60-90 seconds, I think, depending on the number of combatants involved.<br/><br/>Gang up on one demon, and start pulling out tricks like Inverted Cross and Tango Down, and you can wrap it up in less than 5-6 minutes.<br/><br/>Most of the time spent in-game is chewing the scenery, describing how you investigate, or else talking to memorable PCs. Fights happen regularly, even "D&amp;D regularly", but most last under 5 minutes I think.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403780/#Comment_403780" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T21:08:00+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  9:08PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made up a quick and dirty character sheet along the lines you were thinking of.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5bS9J1O4w-4UkFjNTE5a3dPeDg/edit" rel="nofollow">Scorn Character Sheet</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
