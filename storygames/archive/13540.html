The three cards of the flop determining the location of the scene, the basic situation unfolding and the intentions of those involved in the scene. The turn card escalates proceedings in an unexpected direction, while the river determines how the  success or failure of events in the scene will affect the unfolding storyline.<br/><br/>To cater to a general audience, I've created the first generator to build stories in a medieval genre/setting.<br/><br/>I've sketched some outlines for the following settings: western, sci-fi, psychological horror, modern supernatural romance, and a few others...but I'm wondering what other types of settings might draw people's interest.

What genres have been done to death and are really in need of a revamp?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305954/#Comment_305954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T06:37:27+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  6:37AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Synergy! A while back I made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rom_(comics)" rel="nofollow">Rom</a> inspired game called <a href="http://dig1000holes.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/spaceknights.pdf" rel="nofollow">SpaceKnights</a> for a 24-hour contest. At the core of it is a Texas Hold'em situation generator very similar to what you're describing here. I never got a chance to playtest mine (because it was foolishly designed for exactly 6 players). Have you tried yours out?

An intense combat scene, suddenly becomes a romantic conflict, a verbal argument in a back alley suddenly becomes swarmed with inquisitors seeking to purge your soul of evil...<br/><br/>While I like to think of it as a great producer of "story now" (it brings unplanned events into the narrative and forces players and their characters to push against a random universe)...it might be actually an example of "story after" (the events occur and often seem to be non-sequitur, it is only through later analysis that a pattern and story can be identified).<br/><br/>Basically, the Flop lays three cards on the table, Location (a scene that determines the potential bonuses gained), Situation (the surface events of the scene, and the potential effects of failure in the scene) and Intention (the opponents motives behind the scene and what you'll have to risk to proceed in the scene). On the GM has the three cards, he (or she) may allocate them between the three categories in whatever manner seems to fit the story.<br/><br/>The Turn applies an Escalation (a new twist in events and a new type of risk that must be also be taken for players hoping to succeed in the scene).<br/><br/>The River applies a final difficulty for the scene, and determines what type of actions will find it easier to successfully resolve the immediate events. If you draw a low river card you'll have an easier chance of succeeding but the payoff won't be as good...conversely if you draw a high river card, the chance of success gets harder but the payoff is proportionally greater.<br/><br/>Each scene has a chance of success or failure, with each success adding points to a pool to indicate how far you have proceeded in the story and each failure either stripping points from the pool or raising the bar on the number of points needed to proceed.<br/><br/>It's actually based on something I was brainstorming for a solo RPG.<br/><br/>I've tossed in a few ideas for turning the process into a meta-game, allowing players to bid to add their own narrative into scenes, or bid for the best chance of success through the scenes, but at this stage I'm trying to keep it as a fairly generic oracle for use with any gaming system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305984/#Comment_305984" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T13:55:22+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  1:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is crazy. I have been playing with the idea of adding some poker elements into RPGs for a while now, and not just terminology. I have 2 possible avenues for a "solo but expandable to multiple players" game, and a hold 'em style scene setting and resolution system was one of them. Now it seems that there is this thread and another that both have poker style mechanics in them. Interesting. <br/><br/>This just proves that the end of the world is coming fast....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306107/#Comment_306107" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T06:44:54+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  6:44AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey this sounds great, .........just browsing and possibility's look inspiring.<br/>\nJust what I'm looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that would be cool as well, a sort off occult thing.<br/>\nThe search for enlightenment is fraught with interpretation be it through love, evil, self sacrifice, science.
