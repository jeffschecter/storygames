<p>So, I was thinking about <em>City of the Moon</em> and <em>Snow From Korea.</em> They've got reasonably compatible structure for this effort, I think; it's particularly felicitous that each game's main characters will be at best supporting characters for the other game.</p>
<p>I want to play these at once, and have them work together and connect. Sometimes you might be playing a scene where only <em>City</em>'s mechanics are in effect, or where <em>SFK</em> is ascendant, but also there can be scenes where they're both in place and interacting.</p>
<p>I don't know how to do this yet. But, does it sound like a good idea? How might I do it?</p>
