I was often in three or four of them at a time and I played on multiple websites across a period of about six years.<br/><br/>Universally, they didn't work.<br/><br/>What do I mean by not working? I mean that baring a handful of exceptions, they fizzled before the end of the first scene. None of them successfully completed anything resembling a story arc or resolved in a satisfactory way. <br/><br/>My experiences weren't without value. I got really good at creating characters and I participated in a lot of fun world-building, so I don't feel that my time was wasted, but I was always disappointed that the game part of these games just never came together.<br/><br/>Has anyone had similar experiences to me?

The system was a bit too complex for my taste, but the GM handled most of it, so there wasn't any trouble. The GM usually framed the scene in the first post and then we get to explain our intentions and post it with our rolls (I recall that forum had a tool for rolling dice randomly whenever you posted) For the next post the GM checked which one of our intentions was more appropiate for the result of the roll and framed the scene from there. <br/><br/>The system worked really good even for battles, and the GM usually posted the cue to the next part of the scene every 3 days or so.

I have successfully completed one PbP out of probably twelve. The problem is, people start playing PbP because they don't have the time or ability to play with a real life group. So the attitude in the beginning is uncontrolled excitement - you're so excited to play that you just can't wait so let's start up a play by post. But then the slow pace of PbP never gives you the satisfaction you're looking for because RPG's are inherently a conversation that requires a lot of back and forth between the people playing. Sometimes you'd go days without hearing back from the player you're waiting on. In that time, the excitement fizzles out. And once the excitement starts fizzling out, people start to leave half-assed responses which in turn makes you feel kind of like a chump if you're still putting in full effort.<br/><br/>The one successful PbP I did was just me and the GM and we both pretty much posted multiple times a day. The faster pace kept interest up and allowed us to finish what was essentially a one-shot in about two months.<br/><br/>EDIT: Another thing that drove me nuts was when people would write novels in their post. They turn a post that should be "I'm going to stand there and smoke my cigarette" into a long drawn out flashback with tons of dialog between characters that have nothing to do with the current game just so they explain that the reason they're so stoic and cool and they smoke cigarettes is because their father was asshole who killed their brother, but it turns out their brother was really a trader and blah blah blah ten paragraphs later and their character does nothing in the scene. I think that might count as doll-housing. I'm sorry, when I play PbP I don't want to have to read your characters life story in the middle of combat or something. I actually started specifically asking for people not to do that in the games I hosted after the first few times.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393797/#Comment_393797" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T16:13:52+00:00" title="October 18, 2012  4:13PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something I'm slowly but surely working on: a set of principles and structures to enhance PbP.<br/><br/>But you're problem - a lack of commitment on the part of the players - is something very difficult to fix. The best things I've found are thusly:<br/><br/>* Start with in media res with a super grabby situation and only let go during short plot intermissions. From my one real attempt at GMing a  PbP game, this was my problem: I spent way too much time on long, half-hearted descriptions and boring setup scenes, and I lost steam within a few days.<br/>* Structure it into short episodes lasting roughly a week rather than long, ongoing storylines. This allows players to participate according to their own schedules, as television episodes typically only feature a sampling of the main characters (in My Little Pony there will be something like four of the six MCs actually featured in a given episode).<br/>* Finally, if you're on a relatively small forum where everyone knows each other, you might just flat out refuse to let someone with a history of dropping out in. I've never seen it happen, and you're likely to get flamed, but hey man, it's your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393798/#Comment_393798" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T16:22:15+00:00" title="October 18, 2012  4:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, long drawn out setup scenes with no real purpose other than to let the players role-play tend to fizzle excitement as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393822/#Comment_393822" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T19:28:27+00:00" title="October 18, 2012  7:28PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my players tonight mentioned that he's played in a few successful Play By Post games, but those games were in a very different format then I am used to.<br/><br/>The games that I played were games with a single narrative thread that everyone was involved it. As I mostly played on forums where many different games were run simultaneously, a game would typically have only a single thread for the story and possible a single thread for out of character discussion.<br/><br/>In the successful games my friend describes there was an entire forum dedicated to gaming within a shared setting, but with multiple simultaneous narrative threads, with only a hazily connected chronology between them. Thus in one thread you might be in a life-and-death struggle with a bunch of monsters, but in another thread you could be having high-tea with one of your friends.<br/><br/>Because of this, individual people being unable to post frequently was less of a problem. If the people you're currently playing with cannot respond quickly enough you can just switch to a different thread with different people using the same character.<br/><br/>It sounds like it might be a more functional model. <br/><br/>Has anyone played in a game with that structure? It reminds me a lot of chat-based rpg's or MUDs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393870/#Comment_393870" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T04:31:43+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  4:31AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played more PBP games that I'd call successful than not.<br/><br/>I'm currently <i>not</i> running a PBForum game of Apocalypse World because the site fell behind the work firewall and I don't have time to run it while I'm not at work.  But I wouldn't consider it a failure.  I ran for over a year and most of the players were invested and we all played nearly every weekday for that whole time.  And I still hope to pick it back up where I left it (one obstacle after another!).<br/><br/>I've also played games that fizzled.  You have to have committed fellow players.  And you have to be able to weather serious hiccups like players disappearing -- for a couple weeks or forever.  Normally, if the player who disappears is the GM, the game is over.  But if not, y'all ought to be able to move on.<br/><br/>I played three or four pretty big PBWiki games of Universalis years ago and they all started strong and petered out.  The way they ended was universally unsatisfying, but we also got as much good play out of them as I'd expect from a face to face session.  Some games, Uni especially(?), have a high hurdle to getting new players to join once the game is going because they've missed the initial phase where the game is conceptualized and built.<br/><br/>Another thing that I've found is that it works best if everyone has the same expectation about how often play will happen.  There is friction of a sort between the player who participates every hour and the one who stops by every three days.  The former is exasperated and the latter is left behind.  <br/><br/>Also, the GM (if it's that kind of game) needs to be among to most frequent participants.  I've played in games where the GM had all the right skills and vision but couldn't post often enough to maintain momentum.  If she's the one coming only every third day to update all the threads, <i>I</i> won't be able to stay attended.  When I have an active game, I just keep a browser tab pointed to the game at all times and refresh it every time I have a down moment -- then if there's stuff to which I should respond, I write.  But when it goes for a day and then two and then three with no updates, I'm more likely to close that tab with the thought that I'll just check back in a few days.  And then that turns into a week and when I do get back, I'm three days later than the GM who actually posted twice and the others either skipped me or have been waiting(!) for me.  So then I leave the tab up and nothing happens for three days and I close it.  Etc.  Maybe if Tuesday and Saturday were known to be the days the GM would catch up, that kind of posting rate would work.  But barring a pretty regular and well-defined schedule, I think these games work only with almost every-day participation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/obgoblin" title="obgoblin"><img alt="obgoblin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nIU1B5D5GVVOS.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/obgoblin">obgoblin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393913/#Comment_393913" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T10:32:39+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 10:32AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is similar to yours, Jack.

It allows you to alter the pace of the game to fit interest and still come to a satisfying conclusion as well as maintaining interest because it'd be a shame to quite this close to the end.  Chapters are sort of the same because you are setting out with more immediate story arcs in mind, thirty minute episodes of a tv show rather than 12 hour film trilogies.<br/><br/>In general, conflict resolution has worked better for me than finer grained task resolution.  Also, more player agency allows for more story/post because players don't have to ask to do things and get GM feedback and certainly don't have to do it a bunch of times (counter example, D&amp;D combat: your turn, ok I roll to attack, you hit, I roll damage, it's not dead but wounded = 5 posts over 1-3 days)...<br/><br/>Games that have worked well for me include: Shotgun Diaries, Lady Blackbird, AW, DW, Ghost/Echo<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/obgoblin" title="obgoblin"><img alt="obgoblin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nIU1B5D5GVVOS.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/obgoblin">obgoblin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393951/#Comment_393951" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T13:21:54+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  1:21PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree with all of your analysis and I think your idea of parallel games is interesting.

What does running two games in parallel help with?</blockquote>\nI find that games either stall because you're waiting for someone, or because you know you need to write something, but can't decide what it should be. Running parallel games helps with the second problem, because it's less likely you'll be stumped on two different games at once (especially if you have different roles in each). Since the rule is you have to reply to both games at the same time, your drive to continue one game helps push through your block on the other. (That's part of why there's that bit about making your posts connected; writing for the first game is supposed to help generate ideas for the second.) It's definitely not a perfect solution; you could get stumped on both games, or you might let the slower game drag the faster one down, but I haven't had that happen (yet).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/mease19">@mease19</a><br/><br/>That bit about foreseeable endpoints is great advice.

It has more structure and functionality, including game mechanics that tie the game system into the narrative, and "sourcebooks" that help establish the setting and drive the game.  On top of that it has mechanisms to keep the action going over time, such as automatic email reminders when you're "late" in taking your turn.<br/><br/>I would be super interested to hear what PbP gamers think of this thing, and what I could do to make it better!<br/><br/>It's called <b>VORPS</b>.  Here's an alpha test game that's been going on for a few months and has survived numerous personal and professional distractions on the part of all the participants:<br/><br/><a href="http://vorps.com/example" rel="nofollow">http://vorps.com/example</a><br/><br/>You can sign up for an account using this secret link (shhhh):<br/><br/><a href="http://vorps.com/signup/story-games" rel="nofollow">http://vorps.com/signup/story-games</a><br/><br/>Hope you find it interesting...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
