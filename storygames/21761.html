TL;DR: Judgement in RPGs can be interesting, but it can so easily be a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, although I'm not forbidding it utterly, this is something with which you have to be very, very careful.  The idea of an RPG, especially one with a turn-based scene-narration structure, is to build a story together around a given structure, with everyone throwing their ideas into the mix.  These ideas can be as simple as "I think my elf character should attack the goblin" or as complex as "I think the results of the chemical analysis should raise new and stranger questions".  Generally, though, the point is that, if someone has authority over what gets to happen, we roll with it.  I've played a couple of games with some players where it just wasn't fun anymore because their relationship outside the game allowed one to boss the other around.  Essentially, only one of the two ever had authority.  Judgement risks stagnating the game, negating player authority, and possibly causing arguments.  For example, I once ran a game in a standard grimdark cyberpunk universe where the players got to choose one "superpower".  We had a couple of street samurai with badass implants, a couple of hackers with crazy computer skills, and then we had one player who wanted, and I quote, "a northern [north of England] accent that lets me talk to computers".  This didn't fit the setting at all, but we went with it and it came out as being extremely interesting and fun.<br/><br/>That said, in small amounts, judgement can be an intriguing mechanic.  <i><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/120165/Rough-Cuts-6-Micro-Games" rel="nofollow">I Hit It with My Axe</a></i>, from Dangerous Games, is a good example of this, I think.  Part of the mechanic consists of players going around the circle and trying to top each others' boasts: "I could kill the dragon", "I could kill the dragon wearing no armour", "I could kill the dragon with no armour, even after reaching it by going through the deadly swamp", and so on.  Eventually, one player will say something like "That's enough", and the last player to boast has to actually go on the quest.  It's quite subtle, but it gives players a chance to quickly stop an idea that they think could go very badly out of control.<br/><br/>There are also games that center around awarding dice for good narration -- narrate five actions on your turn, get five dice.  These are extremely careful to keep from getting bogged down in details, and the dice are awarded by the GM and not other players.<br/><br/>Finally, the idea of "judging another player" isn't necessary for some of what you suggest.  "If your game has contests with uncertain outcomes, maybe other players can affect those outcomes in some way, for or against your characters intentions" is basically the one-sentence summary of every game in which the PCs aren't all working together.  "Other players may modify/take control of the narrative" should happen many, many times over the course of a good session of any RPG, at predefined breaks in the action or when the currently speaking player yields authority to someone else.  (Doing this through player judgement risks being an absolute disaster.  Imagine how you would react if someone said "I'm sorry, I don't think you've been delivering this narrative well enough, so I'm just going to take control of this scene away from you.")<br/><br/>That's a lot more than I thought I was going to write, and I do apologise if I came across as being nasty.  You've got some interesting ideas, but I just think that they need a serious disclaimer.  I'm intrigued to hear what other people think about this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475936/#Comment_475936" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T15:02:14+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  3:02PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/13Clocks" rel="nofollow">13Clocks</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've played a couple of games with some players where it just wasn't fun anymore because their relationship outside the game allowed one to boss the other around.

Both are valid options, though I'd argue that being able to withstand a degree of "dysfunctional out of game dynamics" (however they manifest) is a laudable quality in a game-as-cultural-object (as opposed to game-as-individual-event) regardless of whether or not that situation exists in any given group. It's not necessarily the explicit job of a game designer to address those issues, but that doesn't mean that designing to mitigate it doesn't potentially add value to your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475940/#Comment_475940" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T17:28:38+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  5:28PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2018 5:30PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam's on the ball here.

You cannot really forbid judgement, you can only structure it in various ways to focus it on things that matter, and time it so it comes up at the best time, and construe it in a way that doesn't cause a mental breakdown on some other player's part.<br/><br/>But ultimately, if you don't have judgement you don't have a game. A player choosing which character class to take is "judging" the classes. If the GM designed the class selection, they're "judging" between the GM's creations. If the GM loves one class the best, the player who dislikes that class is critiquing the GM's earnest effort at contributing to the game.

Some love playing the "get &amp; give rewards" game, while others hate feeling judged and find it feels like a popularity contest.  I have been trying to please both and I just don't think it's possible within the same group at the same time.  What I'll probably do is publish with the awards system but include an alternative, completely different system, for groups who hate awards.<br/><br/>I've found that the most valuable (to me, as the designer) function of judgment/rewards is communicating preferences for contributions to the fiction, and fostering coherence on that score.  Accordingly, players need some guidance (make this award about the fiction! let us know what it's for!) but not too much (giving someone a token because you vaguely like what they did but can't say why, and then trying to make up some justification for why which fits an overly-specific framework: that's useless).<br/><br/>Beyond all that, Steve, you can also use judged awards as currency to regulate participation.  Like, if you earn points for participating well, and then receiving points gives you increased ability to participate, you can either have (a) a victory spiral where whoever's talking most just talks more, or (b) a regulating mechanism, where the big talkers have to give their tokens away so that <i>other</i> people get to talk more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475955/#Comment_475955" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T23:28:09+00:00" title="August  8, 2018 11:28PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Finally, the idea of "judging another player" isn't necessary for some of what you suggest.

And, especially, don\u2019t comment on who are the best players. <br/><br/>Maybe a mechanic that rewards \u201cthe best player/s\u201d would work for the right type of game made for the type of player who\u2019s interested in this type of thing, but it doesn\u2019t seem super productive in my estimation.<br/><br/>Now to discuss issues that can arise, which do need to be addressed in relation to your question, when it comes to GMless collaborative Story Game.<br/><br/>The GMless collaborative Story Game design space is the space I\u2019m most familiar in and is the one place in game design I would consider myself qualified to speak on. <br/><br/>I disagree with some designers in the GMless Collaborative Story Game space who think that other players in the group never have the right to suggest modifications to an acting player\u2019s narrative contributions. <br/><br/>Here is the best solution I\u2019ve come up with:<br/><br/>When the active player makes a contribution to the narrative that either...<br/>1. Significantly disrupts the verisimilitude of the story.<br/>2. Significantly undermines the tone of the story. <br/>3. Significantly undermines the coherency of the story.<br/>...then another player can say \u201cHow about...\u201d and give a suggestion that tries to keep the spirit of the active players contribution in tact, but that remedies the precived issue with the contribution. <br/><br/>A player can only suggest a narrative modification if they actually have a alternative in mind; they can\u2019t just say, \u201cHow about...\u201d and not present an alternative. You also can\u2019t just use the \u201cHow about...\u201d mechanic if you don\u2019t like the other player\u2019s narrative contribution; the active player\u2019s contribution must meet one of the three criteria outlined above in order for a modification to be suggested, and players are expected to act in good-will in this regard. <br/><br/>Anyone in the group can also inteject and discuss the suggested modification and suggest another and then the players can come to a consensus about what the ultimate modification to the narrative should be. <br/><br/>Finally, the \u201cHow about...\u201d rule should be used sparingly and should never be used as a way for one player to monopolize the story. <br/><br/>P. S.<br/>Upon rereading your question again, I think I might actually have a sort of \u201cjudgment\u201d rule, given the way you loosely define it, in one of the RPGs I\u2019m designing. In the game, which is a GMless collaborative story game, players can earn tokens by building on elements of the story that were introduced by there fellow players. <br/><br/>So, for example, if another PC created a scene in which they poisoned an NPC and the king is now trying to find the culprit. When it\u2019s my term to create a scene, I could have my player deduce, and tell the king, that the poison was made by a type of flower that is known to grow in only place in the kingdom, and therefore the poisoner may be connected to this place somehow.<br/><br/>So because my PC reintroduced the poison and other ideas from the previous player\u2019s scene, my PC would earn a token, and there is a narrative mechanic that makes it so the token can be spent to influence the narrative. <br/><br/>So I think for mechanics similar to those above, \u201cjudgement\u201d could be useful, although I\u2019m not sure I would call it judgement. I would just call it a mechanic which is designed to create the effect in the game that you would like it to have. Anyway, I don\u2019t think the typical types of judgement, like how \u201cgood\u201d someone is role playing, are likely to add anything good to the RPG experience.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476008/#Comment_476008" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T15:23:35+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  3:23PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2018 4:14PM by yukamichi.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk, it's my experience that humans tend to be pretty awful at actually understanding/explaining why we do things; there's a lot of ideological garbage that can get in the way (for better and for worse, depending on one's objectives).

The game as presented is a sort of dialogue with its creator, and if we want to be open to what they're trying to convey, letting the game mechanics overwrite our personal interpretations at certain points is how we do that.<br/><br/>The more of ourselves we put in there, the more we resist giving ourselves over, the more we push back against becoming possessed by the game, the harder it becomes to hear what the game is trying to say. Part of what I think makes games a potentially powerful medium for conveying things, and why play is such an integral part of psychological development, is the fact that we have to understand, internalize, and enact the rules in order to get something out of it.<br/><br/>That's not to say that all games have a particularly powerful voice, or that this is some sort of universal right way to play or anything: lots of games actually want us to throw ourselves into them rather than the other way around, they're just there to prod us. But if actually listening to the game is something that's important to a player, then it's best to not try to talk over it. The more work the player has to do to separate their own contributions from the game's, the more muddied that message can become. It's not an end-run around the interpretive problems of subjectivity, but I do think it can help lessen its impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476027/#Comment_476027" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T22:10:28+00:00" title="August 10, 2018 10:10PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a thing I sometimes bring up about the implementations of game mechanics, and that thing is hidden modifications.
