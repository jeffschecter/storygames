Like, Cap's "Avengers Assemble" milestone where the 10 XP one is "dissolve the Avengers".  That really doesn't have anything to do with the normal categories of Keys, at least not the ones that exist in the TSOY edition I have.  It's not connected to a motivation (in fact it might be against the motivation, he could find himself stuck in that position against his will), instead it's related to his position in the world.  It's not as personal to him as Keys are.  I think Milestones can be that personal but they don't have to be. I think most Keys would be a good starting point for Milestones (though simple ones like "win a fight", "win a fight against a superior opponent", "lose a fight" probably wouldn't be sufficiently earthshaking.)  <br/><br/>Another good 10 XP Milestone for Cap might be "turn against an Avengers mission and become hunted by them".

More than that, since we are dealing with specific events here (aka story arcs), they will want to play through those events. Sure, they will want to do it their way, but overarchingly, the game should provide the event structure. Milestones, from what I gather, are a great way to do this. More specific than keys, they provide reminders and incentives for that structure. So I, someone who doesn't know jack about Marvel event arcs, could drop into a game with fans and, just by playing with an eye on the Milestones, could support their expectations and have a great time wihout reading up on the canon first. That sounds like a really cool solution to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352363/#Comment_352363" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T11:40:14+00:00" title="December 23, 2011 11:40AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I.

So I can talk about Milestones more now.<br/><br/>Milestones are very, very interesting.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, I've identified several types of Milestones:<br/><br/>Personal Milestones. You're a drunk. You're having a nervous breakdown because the love of your life was murdered by Bullseye in a church. You crave the spotlight. You are looking for love. You stab people in the back.<br/><br/>Power-Related Milestones. Oh my god, you're a filthy mutant. The corporation that built your cybernetics wants it back. You are a werewolf by night and can't control your urges.<br/><br/>Team-Related Milestones.  Nobody on the team respects you. You want to be the leader of the team SO BAD. You are the leader of the team. The team has money problems. The government runs the team. Your old enemy is running the team.<br/><br/>All of the above are created and selected by the player. <br/><br/>There's another kind of Milestone, created by the GM but still selected by the player: the Event-Related Milestone.  Shapeshifting aliens are taking over. SHIELD is acting shady. A mysterious figure is behind the event. The Kingpin appears dead and everyone wants a piece of the kingdom.<br/><br/>It can be remarkably specific.  In fact, I feel the more specific the Milestone triggers are, the clearer the dramatic direction of the character is.<br/><br/>The mini-Event in the main book has 3 Milestones. Multiple players can take them, or nobody can take them.  I think there might be some mileage in having unique Milestones that only one person can select, too.<br/><br/>Milestones are structured similarly to Keys, but I see them as very different in function.  Milestones are a pacing mechanism - if you finish an Event and have done none of them, that's okay. You aren't missing out on anything like you are missing out on the endgame of TSOY.  Instead, here's how I think of Milestone levels:<br/><br/>1 XP triggers: This is a small thing that your character does, related to the issue they're dealing with. It is something the other characters may immediately react to, but which doesn't really "go anywhere".  You only ever get 1 XP from a Scene from this level of Milestone.  I see this as something where the audience chuckles and goes "welp, that's Wolverine" or whoever the character is.  It's just a simple character note.<br/><br/>3 XP triggers: This is a larger thing your character does - something the other characters may need to base a scene around, confront you about, or talk to each other about. Oh my god, it's actually serious. You only ever get 3 XP from a Scene from this level of Milestone.  <br/><br/>10 XP triggers. You can only hit them once in an Act.  This is something that changes the whole of the game going forward for you. This is a major reveal that the audience sits up and takes notice of. It is absolutely unmissable and multiple scenes, confrontations and even conflicts can come from it.<br/><br/>I'll post a bunch of sample Milestones I came up with to help plan my Smallville game (Smallville has no XP so I couldn't actually use them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361079/#Comment_361079" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T08:21:46+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  8:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 8:43AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/15684066078/geraldine-jer-parchman-surfer-unlicensed" rel="nofollow">Geraldine "Jer" Parchman</a>:<br/><br/>Heartbroke Human: She fell in love with a mutant and threw her life away trying to help him.

In fact, once you resolve a Milestone, you don't have to pick another until the next Event if you don't want to.  But I feel that it gives a strong direction. We know what Jer's next problem is going to be:<br/><br/>Half-Hearted Hater: She joined the Friends of Humanity out of bitterness over her mutant-broken heart.<br/><br/>1 XP: when you describe mutants as traitorous, backstabbing, or betrayers.<br/><br/>3 XP: When you out a closeted mutant online or in the media.<br/><br/>10 XP: When you betray the Friends to the X-Men, or establish a secret identity to work against the Friends.<br/><br/>Or maybe if I wanted her to be more of a real hater, I could make it:<br/><br/>10 XP: When a Friends action you support causes the death of a mutant or when you are given a high position in the Friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361090/#Comment_361090" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T08:52:44+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  8:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a little different from Keys, as Keys can be relatively small things, and accumulating and then resolving Keys brings you closer to the TSOY endgame.

Like, hitting a Key scene to scene works the same, but the end result--Transcendance, Event resolution, whatevs--is vastly different.<br/><br/>One thing that seemed hinky in Cap's Milestones in the preview MWP released, is that most of the triggers seemed like one time deals: The FIRST time you advise a hero, the FIRST time you lead a team...where TSoY keys tend to be more general, "whenever you defeat a foe/avoid a fight/push your religion on someone, etc." So you can keep a Key for as long as it speaks to me, hitting those notes with that character as long as they're fun and relevant. Whereas judging from Cap's, Milestones are more focused on "we'll hit these notes in the course of THIS adventure, then move on."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361196/#Comment_361196" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T15:25:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  3:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 3:26PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, exactly. You choose your Milestones anew at the beginning of each Event, or (if you want) when you resolve a previous Milestone. You can pick the same Milestone again if you want - Bendis' Daredevil (hand on heart) was all about different ways of fucking with his secret identity - but you aren't required to and you can always move on if you want to try a different point of view.<br/><br/>This is <i>really important</i>, because to me the key problem with comics continuity isn't that someone will get a power slightly different from how it was in 1968 or whatever, people are pretty forgiving about that (more or less).  It's that over the years different writers see different characters in different ways, and have them play different roles in different stories, and eventually you get boxed into what a character would or wouldn't do, or you end up doing the same shit over and over, because that's all you can imagine the character doing. This is why reboots/reimaginings are so tempting in comics, because the iconic, broadly drawn character is compelling, but the writer wants is to do something new with it.  So basically this setup is how the comics <i>should</i> do it, but they don't do it as well or as often as you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363436/#Comment_363436" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T11:45:04+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:45AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost forgot, I had a first draft of a post written before the game came out and I realized, oh, uh, yeah, NDA.  So here it is!<br/><br/>Here's a set of Milestones I wrote for one of my Marvel universe characters (who previously existed only in the Smallville system) and my reasoning for each level. It's not <i>quite</i> like Keys. Keys are pretty unique. This is not that.<br/><br/><a href="http://humantouchsvrpg.tumblr.com/post/1144954165/agent-j-a-sutherland-lead-full-name-johann" rel="nofollow">SHIELD Agent Johann Amadeus Sutherland</a><br/><br/><b>Milestone: SHIELD's Least Wanted - After the death of his partner (and a whole squad, and a lot of embarrassing lawsuits) in an ill-advised attempt to bring down the Kingpin, Agent Sutherland is jammed into the least desirable positions and given the worst missions Colonel Fury can think of. </b><br/><br/>You pick a Milestone based on the situation you're in at the start of the event. Sometimes it's related to your personal life, sometimes to a professional problem, sometimes to the event.  This is a good example of a professional problem or a problem related to the hero's calling.  <br/><br/>J.A. wants to do good but he really fucked up bad.  So he's on his own, gathering his own assets from the other heroes (PCs) he can find and chasing down any lead he can - normally on his own - to redeem himself in the eyes of his superiors and himself.  So here's the Milestones I worked up:<br/><br/><b>Gain 1 XP when you tell another hero you're a Customs agent.</b> <br/><br/>A 1 XP Milestone is something that you semi-routinely do that adds some flavor to a scene, gives a little juice to a relationship to another PC, etc. Essentially it creates the possibility of approximately <i>a scene or two</i> in the future.  \n<ul>\n<li>"Hey, that Sutherland guy's not with Customs!"  "What gives, J.A.?" </li>\n<li>"Look guys, I have to level with you. I'm not really a Customs agent." </li>\n<li>"That's classified, Customs doesn't need to know about that." "I thought <i>you</i> were Customs!"<br/></li><li>"You lied to me! How could you lie to me?! You prick!"<br/></li><li>"Fuck SHIELD, right JA, I bet you Customs guys are really tired of SHIELD."<br/></li></ul>\nAnd so on.<br/><br/><b>Gain 3 XP when you get caught omitting crucial intel from a report, or when your SHIELD-related traits are shutdown because they won't back you up.</b><br/><br/>Basically a 3 XP Milestone is something that happens less often, adds significant complications or dangers to a scene or relationship or creates <i>several scenes</i> or problems that have to be resolved, a sequence of issues and consequences.  Nevertheless it's still within "normal" for the character you've made in the situation you're in.  It's like the problem/situation you wanted your character to be in, the central part of it when you envisioned how your character might change or struggle.  When this happens you're right on target with that aspect of your character's situation/in the thick of it.\n<ul>\n<li>"Oh my god, didn't you <i>tell</i> them it was mutant terrorists riding dinosaurs?! I guess we're really on our own now..."<br/></li><li>"Agent Sutherland, you really thought you could partner with <i>the Punisher</i> and we wouldn't know?"<br/></li><li>"What part of 'SHIELD takes no role in the mutant issue' do you not understand, Sutherland?"<br/></li><li>"Er, hello, Colonel Fury, fancy meeting <i>you</i> here."<br/></li><li>"You don't believe the building is surrounded with 100 SHIELD agents with laser rifles? How about a half dozen boy scouts with slingshots?"<br/></li></ul>\nAnd so on.<br/><br/><b>Gain 10 XP and delete the Milestone when you must either temporarily take command of SHIELD or when you are brought up on charges of treason by SHIELD.</b><br/><br/>Write your 10 XP Milestone to be related to the Next Big Thing that you are going to do - really, the next Milestone in the arena (personal, professional, spiritual, etc.) that you want to have to deal with.  Basically they are game-changers. <i>Everything is different</i> not just for you but for everyone in your life after the 10 XP Milestone.  If you are ever going to go back to the way things were, guess what? It's time to write a new Milestone all about trying to get back to how things were.\n<ul>\n<li>"Everyone else is dead, Agent Sutherland, not to mention you're the only one who seems to know what a Norn Stone is.  What are your orders?"<br/></li><li>"Hello, I'm your court appointed defense attorney, Franklin Nelson.  You can call me Foggy."<br/></li><li>"The Valkyries are Oscar Mike, mount up and follow, you heard Director Sutherland, this is Ragnarok!"<br/></li><li>"This plea offer isn't really what you'd call an offer, because you can <i>refuse</i> an offer."  <br/></li><li>"Did you <i>see</i> the front page of the Bugle today?"<br/></li></ul>\nAnd that's how you write Milestones for your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363995/#Comment_363995" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T14:59:35+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  2:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks JD.

Character Milestones are a net negative and the game would be better off without them.<br/><br/>1) The primary benefit is to provide bullet point ideas on how to play the character like the comics.  Problem is:<br/>     a) the majority of players will already be Marvel Fans and know far better how to play the characters than these brief snippets anyway.<br/>     b) for those that aren't the brief snippets are really insufficient to be of much use.<br/>     c) far too many of them are just out right bad...either mechanically flawed or narratively questionable.  Three separate games, three different players spent half the game turning to the other players and announcing "I'm not Daredevil" and marking XP.  Another player, as Cap created the New Avengers, promoted Luke Cage to be the leader, fired Luke Cage, and dissolved the New Avengers over the course of 2 scenes just for the XPs.  Thing is, this person wasn't being a weasely munchkin she was actually quite proud that she had caught on to the secret of how to play the game properly so quickly (sincerely....cuz that's how bad the Milestones are).  That's not even counting the ones (like say for Armor) that reward white dudes for reveling in in their Japanese heritage...like THAT can't possibly go wrong.<br/><br/>2) But beyond that, XPs are a completely uninteresting and unnecessary currency.  The only thing XPs do that is of any interest whatsoever is to allow you to rejigger the Sole, Buddy, and Team dice.  That would have been FAR better handled like Challenging from Smallville.  Challenge your Team stat and get triple dice for 1 roll and the right to reorder the dice once per session.  Done.  Far more fictionally interesting and no extra fiddly currency needed.  <br/><br/><br/>I'm a fan of keys...but character milestones might be the absolute worst implementation of them I've yet seen...mechanically flawed, potentially culturally offensive, and entirely unneeded...<br/><br/>Here's a damn near mandatory hack.  Scrap XPs altogether, eliminate all character Milestones altogether.  Reward Plot Points for Event Milestones (gee...get PLOT points for hitting the PLOT triggers in an event...that kind of makes sense).

In the game I played with Ralph, everyone kept the Milestones they had because the Event was made on the fly. We probably could have made up Milestones on the spot but we were all pretty new to the game.<br/><br/>I played Armor and I totally grimaced when I saw the Japanese culture Milestone. I mean, on the one hand, yeah potentially problematic but I'm not going to be the RPG police and smash through people's windows to make sure they're not being racist, but it was just a difficult Milestone to play. I definitely would have tossed it in favor of an Event Milestone had their been one. I could see it working, though, for an Armor-focused story where she and some other X-Men go to Japan for some reason.<br/><br/>I was also in the game with that Captain America. I've played with her before, she's kooky (in a fun way) and I got the vibe less that she was like, "I figured out how to play the game well!" and more that since it was a one-shot, she wasn't that invested in the game, and everyone at the table was cracking jokes and having fun that she was just doing it just to do it. I think it's a problem that wouldn't crop up in groups of people you knew well because you would use the ritual phrase, "Oh come on!" and that would be that.<br/><br/>I do have misgivings about Milestones though for similar reasons. They're hard for me to write well, and XP at the moment feels a bit like a dangling, useless appendage that's been sown on to an otherwise well-designed game because "all RPGs have advancement mechanics."

Maybe rather than 1xp/3xp/10xp the levels could be something like 1pp/1 event-specific story bonus/1 of each of those and Take An Advance and get a new milestone.

You may now <b>close out the Milestone and choose a new one</b>. If it <b>makes sense within the story</b>, you can choose the same Milestone again, ready to pursue it in the <b>next Act</b>.</i><br/><br/><i><b>Earning XP</b><br/>As a player, it\u2019s up to you to keep track of your Milestones. Alert the Watcher to them when there\u2019s a lot going on and things get chaotic\u2014the Watcher can\u2019t keep track of them for you, although it\u2019s generally a good idea for the Watcher to have each hero\u2019s Milestones written down in a list in the Event notes.

Then, <b>assuming you\u2019re not way off your mark</b>, make a note of the XP you just earned.</i><br/><br/>So, in the example of the player of Captain America promoting Luke Cage to lead the Avengers, and then firing him, wouldn't work because A) They could only use the 10XP Milestone <b>once</b> per act, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> They would be closing out that Milestone anyway (Cap just gave up his leadership role to Luke Cage, so can't <i>actually</i> kick him off since Cap is no longer the leader...at least not without some good in-story reason for Cap to actually keep that Milestone), and would need to choose a new Milestone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364227/#Comment_364227" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T10:59:37+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 10:59AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely looking forward to the day\u2014hopefully one not far off\u2014when MWP will release a <i>Marvel Heroic Hacking Guide</i> that delves into the system and provides guidance for chargen, rolling your own events, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364232/#Comment_364232" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:09:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I'm definitely looking forward to the day\u2014hopefully one not far off\u2014when MWP will release a<i>Marvel Heroic Hacking Guide</i>that delves into the system and provides guidance for chargen, rolling your own events, and so on.</blockquote>\nI am in agreement.
