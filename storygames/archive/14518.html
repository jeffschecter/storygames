My daughter has been watching the latest season of Dr Who and is becoming a little proto-Whogeek. We have played some <i>Trollbabe</i> and some <i>Sorcerer</i>, and we are looking at <i>Mouse Guard</i>, and I mentioned that there was a Dr Who RPG. Possibly a mistake because now she is all fired up to play.<br/><br/>So I throw this on you, Story Games. How could I do Dr Who? I've thought about <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, but so far I haven't got any further.

Of course, as a 4rd grader his reading level was that of a 6th grader, but you know.

Not the whole RPG, just the Emulator ( and maybe Mythic GME: Variations).<br/><br/>Yeah, I know, I plug the heck out of that thing, but run with it.<br/><br/>Instead of playing single character roleplaying style, have the characters there and use the MGME to help what through the spontaneous story-building part.<br/><br/>It let's you be a little bit character playish, a little GMish, and a little story-maker-ish, without dividing out the duties so much.<br/><br/>She sounds like she already has a pretty good handle on what she likes about the Who-niverse, so why not just run with it? Plus, you get to flip-flop between all of that kinds of play too, which can be fun. Toss in some of Matthijs' very polite phrases from Archipelago ( and perhaps the Element Ownership as well), and you should be good to go.<br/><br/>The reasoning behind my suggestion is both from my own good experiences using MGME with Elliot W, and from my experiences tryiong to play RPGs with my own daughter when she was a similar age. <br/><br/>She had no particular interest in just playing a character, nor in just GMing, but was great when we experimented with styles that allowed a particpant to be both in varying amounts as the mood took them, and MGME is a great toolkit for exactly that sort of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
