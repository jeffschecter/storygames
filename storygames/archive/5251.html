I admit at first I was a little disappointed in that I hoped I get something kind of weird.  But the more I thought about it the more excited I got as this had the potential to be a very powerful combination.  I jumped on this ASAP and played the game on Saturday.<br/><br/>Because this was not a design competition I wanted to make as few changes to the core Dirty Secrets rules as possible.  Obviously, the your town, last week setting went out the window.  I wanted to encourage Violence for obvious reasons so I added the rule that when the Authority blocks with a Violence scene they can refresh one die (as it turned out this was irrelevant because people only proposed Violence scenes when they happened to have five dice).<br/><br/>The more important changes were in the demographics.  Sex, Age, and Social Class remained the same.  However Race and Legal Status were as follows.<br/><br/>Race: German, Russian, Polish \u2013 Non-Jewish, Polish-Jewish.<br/>Legal Status: Home Army, Grey Rank, People\u2019s Army, SS, Other Military, Government Official, and Citizen.<br/><br/>Note: I originally had Red Army in here but the group thought they weren\u2019t very relevant and ended up replacing it with the People\u2019s Army which worked REALLY well.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets involves a step where you decide if you\u2019re going to allow or disallow characters who are minors.  Disallowing minors seemed to defeat the purpose of playing Grey Ranks.  So I decided that the minimum age of a Character is 15 and anyone under 18 had to either be a Citizen or a Grey Rank.<br/><br/>I mandated that the Investigator be a Grey Rank.<br/><br/>Another big change I made was the way the demographics were laid out around the game board.  At the top I replaced all the law enforcement agencies with Grey Ranks and Home Army.  I replaced all the White Rich/Middle-Class/Poor with Germen Military/Government/Citizen.  I replaced all the Non-White Rich/Middle-Class/Poor with Non-German Military/Government/Citizens.  I eliminated both the Ex-Con entries and simply put Jews on the bottom.<br/><br/>I was going to leave the Crimes unchanged but Will had some interesting ideas.  At first he suggested three different alternatives, Profiteering, Collaboration and one other I can\u2019t remember.  The group sort of jumped at Collaboration so we replaced Blackmail with Collaboration.  Theft and Murder stayed.<br/><br/>The Investigator turned out to be 15-year old Stanislaw, Grey Rank Name: \u201cGrom\u201d.  He was played by Colin.<br/><br/>The initial situation was as follows.  Lidia, a member of the People\u2019s Army puts much pressure on Konrad, a Jew in hiding, to join up and fight for the cause.  Lidia gets much sympathy and support from her Russian boyfriend Branislov who lives in the same building as Konrad.  Konrad has taken under his wing a young orphan girl named Ludweka and tries to keep her out of harms way as well.  Recently a religious artifact (a small scroll) identifying Konrad as a Jew has been stolen and Konrad believes Lidia is responsible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118396/#Comment_118396" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T21:05:53+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  9:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I was teaching the game I took first Authority.  For the opening sequence I narrated how young Stanislaw over hears Lidia complaining to Branislov that the \u201ccoward\u201d Konrad came around accusing her of stealing his scroll.  I then immediately rolled straight into a Violence sequence in which I created a new Character, a German SS officer named Carston.  Carston was attempting to haul Konrad and Ludweka away.  But in the end the Violence was minor and the SS officer was chased off with minor injury.<br/><br/>Authority passed to Will and we got our first conflict that I think setup the entire (really sad) theme of the game.  Stanislaw wanted to convince Konrad that he needed stand up and join the fight.  He succeeded and added that Ludweka wanted to join the Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>Colin wanted to take the Revelation mechanics out for a spin and low behold on the walk to military headquarters Ludweka reveals that Carston is her uncle whom she thought was dead.<br/><br/>At the military encampment Santislaw gets into his first (of many) conflicts with Lidia who wants sole jurisdiction over looking into this mysterious SS agent.  She wins and Stanislaw goes back to his Grey Rank duties.  Patrick really set the tone for Lidia in this scene to the point that people kept wanting him to play Lidia when he wasn\u2019t the Authority.  Most of us came to really not like Lidia I think.<br/><br/>Authority passes to Laura who proceeds introduce the most brutal element of the whole game.  She narrates that Stanislaw is out with his cousin and fellow Grey Rank \u201cZeta\u201d and they\u2019ve been sent to check up on Ludweka who has not returned from her first mission of delivering some important documents.  They arrive to find that she\u2019s been brutally tortured and killed and her documents have been stolen.<br/><br/>At this point we have all three Crimes for our novella in play: The Theft of Konrad\u2019s scroll,  A Collaboration against Konrad (i.e someone leaking information that gets him in trouble), and finally the Murder of Ludweka.  Actually at this point we knew the Perpetrator of the Collaboration was Carston which introduced a bit of a problem.  How can a German SS officer be a\u2026. German collaborator\u2026\u2026  we tried to introduce a Mistaken Identity but the rules state that only swaps the name of a Victim not a Perpetrator\u2026. You\u2019ll see how this worked out in a bit.<br/><br/>It should be noted that it became a really big deal that Ludweka died before she received her official Grey Rank name.  That she died for her cause, \u201cnameless.\u201d  This became an oft repeated and very sad meme.<br/><br/>Things got rapidly complicated from here\u2026  Turns out:<br/><br/>Konrad and Lidia are moving valuable art objects out of the country using Ludweka as a go between.<br/><br/>Carston has a fraternal twin brother named Merek and the two can be confused.  Merek is Ludweka\u2019s father.  He impersonated Carston in an effort to extract Ludweka.<br/><br/>This has put much animosity between Carston and Merek as Merek\u2019s actions have jeopardized the fact that Carston is really working with the Russians exchanging valuables for information<br/><br/>But!  Carston is really a double agent passing secrets back to the Germans passed in the valuable objects.  Secrets placed in the valuable objects by Branislov covering his deliveries as just part of Lidia\u2019s profiteering scheme.<br/><br/>In particular these are Jewish artifacts that are being passed so that the Germans may frame certain non-jewish individuals and have grounds to arrest them.<br/><br/>How it all ends\u2026.<br/><br/>Lidia forces Stanislaw to swear allegiance to the people\u2019s army but when forced to choose between his new communist comrades and his Grey Rank peers he sides with the Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>Stanislaw manages to prove to Lidia that Branislov is a traitor and indeed is the one who tortured Ludweka for her secret documents.<br/><br/>However, it turns out that Ludweka committed suicide after her brutal treatment from the pain and the guilt of the activities she\u2019d participated in.  We nudged the rules a bit here and decided that another Grey Rank was there who put Ludweka out of her misery but that it was at Ludweka\u2019s insistence and decision.<br/><br/>Stanislaw exposes Lidia\u2019s profiteering and other shady dealings to her fellow People\u2019s Army members who jeer her out in humiliation.<br/><br/>Merek eventually shoots and kills Carston largely in self defense.<br/><br/>Merek tries to commit suicide shortly there after but Stanislaw stops him (barely, Merek is still critically injured).  Note: This was an interesting scene because Colin called for a Conflict and set his Goal as: \u201cI want to care enough to stop him\u201d which was brutally tragic.<br/><br/>Notice at this point that all the crimes have been solved except the original Theft which was rapidly seeming trivial.  I was the Authority over a scene between Zeta and Stanislaw where Zeta had to urge Stanislaw to go on if only because, \u201cTruth and Justice are Truth Justice regardless of the state of the world\u201d and so that he could, \u201cSleep at night.\u201d<br/><br/>Stanislaw goes to interrogate Branislov whose been arrested by the People\u2019s Army.  Branislov is shot and killed when he attacks Stanislaw.  Sanislaw finds the stolen scroll on his body.<br/><br/>Stanislaw returns the scroll to Konrad who is fleeing the country (after being shot and injured by Branislov earlier in the story).  Stanislaw wishes him well on his journey (a total turn around from his absolute patriotism on the matter earlier on in the story).<br/><br/>The final scene involved the Grey Ranks raiding Branislov\u2019s apartment and finding a ledger of all the various artifacts he had stolen.  There in the ledger is listed Konrad\u2019s scroll.  Zeta brings the ledger to Stanislaw and just says, \u201cSo you can sleep at night.\u201d<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this story was Stanislaw\u2019s slow transformation from a one-note idealist patriot into a more complex individual.  A good chunk of the conflicts involved characters co-opting each other into their person agenda under the guise of patriotism.  It was really sad to see Stanislaw slowly realize that all these people who are supposed to be on the same \u201cside\u201d aren\u2019t really all on the same side after all.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118399/#Comment_118399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T21:33:32+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  9:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First writeup!

It did tragic war story very well but I think it lacked some of the romantic texturing you would get out of doing Grey Ranks straight.  I've listened to 10 minutes of a Grey Ranks game totally out of context and felt like crying before.  Unless you count "Patriotism" as "A thing held dear" we didn't see Stanislaw sacrificing much of himself or what he cared for as the game went on to accomplish his goals.<br/><br/>But just as a game experience in general I rate it much higher closer to a 9 or even 10.  It was a great time and I think it demonstrates that Dirty Secrets can be used to create compelling narratives in any setting where human betrayal and deceit is at the forefront of the conflicts.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Do I get bonus points for coming in first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118414/#Comment_118414" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T04:12:06+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  4:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds like the two games meshed quite well.

I'm glad we decided to go with just replacing blackmail with collaboration.  Fraternization is really just a form of collaboration and the theft basically ended up being rapped up in profiteering any way and had fraternization been in there we would have ended up with a very different story.  <br/><br/>Something Jesse didn't mention, which I found interesting, was during the initial generation of characters we all decided there should be a Jew in the story.  We all added that demographic to one of the character cards as they made their way around.  After that, we realized we had too many for a realistic feel and used our vetoes to change all but one of those demographics.  <br/><br/>I had a great time playing in this.  I feel we didn't just play Dirty Secrets set in occupied Warsaw but really played Grey Ranks using the Dirty Secrets rules.  That may seem like there is a subtle, or no, difference between the two, but I think the difference had a huge impact on the fiction we created.

I was actually kind of disappointed by it when I first read it.  The whole Liar's Dice thing really put me off and the structure seemed too minimal to really push what the game claimed to be about.... I was VERY VERY WRONG.

When I decide to organize a game it's like the opening sequence of the old Mission Impossible where I open up this catalogue of people and assemble my team.  But within that network are a lot of really great creative people who know how to throw and take their emotional punches.  I fully admit that I'm an emotional masochist when it comes to RPGs and was once even accused of enjoying RPGs as a form of "social violence."<br/><br/>I don't know if there were any full disappointments.  As noted there was a bit of a cognitive disconnect when Carston ended up being the Perpetrator of Collaboration.  There was much scrambling to try and justify that and the resulting Carston/Merek subplot was a bit muddled and confused at times in order to make sense of that particular outcome.<br/><br/>Laura also was a little shocked by the direction the Lidia character took.

When Ludwika originally hit the table, I envisioned this Innocent caught up in the roiling terrors of a besieged Warsaw.  And then I think it was Patrick?  Who suddenly introduced the plotline that Ludwika was actually in on the smuggling/profiteering operation. And by that point Lidia was already A Villain, so then that suddenly coloured my entire perspective of who/what Ludwika was (which prompted the outburst you're no doubt remembering of "No, wait, what?  Not Ludwika, no!")<br/><br/>In the end, it still worked out for me:  Lidia was blackmailing Ludwika to do her bidding, which the guilt of drove Ludwika to commit her suicide.  She remained the innocent if tainted girl, the catalyst that drove Grom to realize that there is more to war then Nationalistic unity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118546/#Comment_118546" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:55:24+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Laura, I thought you were somewhat disappointed when Lidia turned out not to be some young communist idealist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop" title="Laura Bishop"><img alt="Laura Bishop" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/433/nKL1G7M6ODYGZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop">Laura Bishop</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118566/#Comment_118566" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:38:33+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2008 12:42PM by Laura Bishop.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was disappointed when she turned out to be in it more for herself than for her cause, true.

No one can say for sure what a given Character is up to.  This is very cool.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Laura Bishop</cite>The conceptual setting for DS is "your home town, last week".

However, it's where I live, so I'll embrace it anyways.<br/><br/>I can understand that others might not see things this way.  If you really don't like the default setting, you could easily hack <i>Dirty Secrets</i> into being a period piece (e.g. <i>L.A.

Laura's answers was what I was looking for in my question.  Collaborative characters seem to be the new sliced bread for many story games.  I certainly did it for my horror game.<br/><br/>You'll see in my Psi-Run game and soon in the playtest of my Contenders "variant, Survivors! that my wife is struggling with shared ownership.  A few of the folks that I play with have the same concerns in many of these games, where the character goes off in a direction you really don't expect - the key there is that they are expecting instead of "holding lightly."  I was wondering if anyone in Jesse's game ran into that problem for games like Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>I love it.  Even before I drank the SG koolaid I always encouraged my players to leave swathes of backstory open so we could explore them and I could fill in complicated details.  In a traditional game I had always seen my role as the PCs subconscious, their baser drives, inclinations, inuitions, etc while they played the character's conscious mind - I do this and I think that.  This was motivated also by my bucking against the idea that players almost always had their characters be perfect - they always did the right thing, they always viewed their actions as flawless.  It bugged me so I tried adding some humanity (assuming they were human).  Others in my play groups REALLY didn't like that.<br/><br/>But I am dangerously close to derailing so if anyone is interested in exploring this stuff more by all means start another thread.  I was just into discussing correlations to other games, like Dirty Secrets and Psi-Run that share character space.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118821/#Comment_118821" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T11:46:04+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 11:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Linnaeus</cite><br/>How useful did you find the handbook section of the rulebook?

I think the only other player at the table who'd actually read the book was Will.  Which is the one drawback of the handbook: It's very good but hard to communicate succinctly when you're teaching the game to others.<br/><br/>The real central idea from it I pushed is the idea of everyone having a working theory and playing to that theory when they have Jurisdiction over stuff.  When I first played the game I didn't really get that across and the people I were playing with were initially resigned to the outcome being "random" and therefore unsure what to do.  I mentioned the working theory thing and the game tightened up quickly so now I make that real clear up front.<br/><br/>I also try to point out that the solution is not random, it's semi-random because we write names down on the grid.  The more you control the grid the more you can write down the names of people YOU personally think are guilty.  So that's incentive to start and win conflicts.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118942/#Comment_118942" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T08:59:54+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  8:59AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2008 10:41PM by noclue.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM playing the PC's subconscious???
