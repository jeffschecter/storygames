I haven't been around to these forums much lately, but I think some people here might be interested to know that I just finished posting the public beta rules. There seems to be a lot of different standards about what "alpha" and "beta" mean, so I'll just say that here it means that I'm not calling the game finished, but I think it's far enough along for you to read the rules, download the appropriate sheets, and play the game without me having to be there.<br/><br/>You'll find everything at <a href="http://thefifthworld.com/" rel="nofollow">thefifthworld.com</a>. It's more utilitarian than visually captivating right now, but I'll be adding to it in the coming days and weeks.

I've been hearing good things about Fifth World for a while, but keeping missing it at cons.  The web page looks great and I've begun reading, but I'd really recommend that your first priority for any updates be a table of contents/links up top.  There's a bit much here for me to read all at once in order; the ability to orient myself, skip around, and come back later and find my place, will all be necessary for me to digest this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428604/#Comment_428604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T02:05:20+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  2:05AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woah!

I especially liked bookending scenes with the ritual phrase "It happened at".  For some reason that mechanic made the stories seem more agreed upon by the group, more real and yet more mythic at the same time.<br/><br/>The character generation is a blast, and though we didn't get to do the clan creation (as it was a con game, constrained by time), I'm sure it would also offer much fun.<br/><br/>More later after sleep....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
