This might be training, trying to out-drink a bar, convincing a lord to lower taxes on the barony, and so on.  Let the player choose what they're trying to do, help them describe the scene.  Then ask the other players for 1 other person who would be in the same vicinity, and get the strongest connection (preferably one where they're in the same scene).  Now introduce the scene with a conflict happening right away.  Can the lord be convinced?  How much have you had to drink?  Is your training paying off or are you losing focus?  During that conflict have the other player character arrive with a lead or hook to the adventure; if that doesn't make sense have enemies attack the scene.<br/><br/>2)  Have a flashy weather event (usually a storm, a windy night, a full moon), and a meeting between a player character and another one, or a player character and an NPC, and introduce the hook.<br/><br/>3)  Tell the players the hook, ask them how they get involved, and then once you know how they are involved, and with the adventurers' involvement established off-camera, start the game with a fight.<br/><br/>4)  Start the game with a fight that is the hook - who attacked us?  Why?  Is the city watch turning against us?  Are there goblins in the sewers?"<br/><br/>So what am I missing?  I don't like the way the first one is written but I want to cover those training / celebration / at court scenes that are interrupted when these stories start.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125541/#Comment_125541" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T11:19:19+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 11:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife pointed out that 4 is a subset of 1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125545/#Comment_125545" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T11:39:46+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 11:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, what kind of "adventure RPG" are you making?

Great for establishing protagonist motives, not so great for connecting several PCs together.<br/><br/>* The Dragonlance -- a scene where the main characters, who are all old friends, meet up again after some time apart. The joyful reunion is quickly interrupted, though, when The Bad Guys show up and do something Bad. Great for connecting PCs, ok (if horribly obvious) for introducing conflict, not so great for establishing protagonist motive.<br/><br/>* The TV Monster-of-the-Week Show -- the first scene doesn't involve the PCs at all, but instead shows The Bad Guys doing something Bad to a disposable innocent bystander. Great for introducing The Bad Guys, but unless we already know the protagonists, it doesn't really do much for them.<br/><br/>(edit: I should learn to type faster!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125554/#Comment_125554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T11:56:39+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 11:56AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2008 11:57AM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is for Camaraderie, where players are part of a party that has goals right off the bat.

In the goblin example, you may effectively be asking them to face a tactical challenge, but do it badly.  If the game is about fighting off 30 goblins in the form of meeting a tactical challenge, then you likely should have tactical rules to represent the suprise or simply set up the relative positions such to produce the effect (examples of such rules range from d20s flat footed rule, automatically losing "initiative" and so on).  If the priority is story (building tension, climax, resolution) then what's the point of the players acting surprised?  What part of that is going to help the story build tension, climax and resolve?  It certainly could, but that would likely have to do with the larger narrative context-- why are the goblins ambushing them, what the conflicting goals between the player characters and other characters in the setting?  How does this goblin attack fit into that?<br/><br/>Now let's take it to the other example-- "OK, you know this mysterious stranger just talked to your enemy, act like you don't know a thing" also runs contrary to the above priorities of play.  If it's a tactical situation where they have to out maneuver their enemy in social combat, then you have the same problem as the goblin example.

This is aside from the the issue of "is the secret given away" or not.  I suggest the GM (or Player who has authority to frame/request scenes and set things off) should ask themselves this of what they're thinking about as a first scene:<br/><br/>1) Does it reliably introduce the start of what can be an arc of scenes which will be "this adventure" by being an encounter with the forces or consequences of the "adversary" or "conflict" that this particular adventure revolves around  (e.g., show the abnormal weather that is the side effect of the bad thing that the adventure is about stopping developing into the uber bad event)?  Does it do this in an exciting, evocative, thematic way hinting at what is to come (foreshadowing etc.)?   It may be mysterious, unclear, a false clue but it "starts" things and looking back can be seen as "that was when this started".<br/><br/>2) Does it contain threads that Players can seize on to drive action forward with their choices?   Where do things go from here other than you throwing another scene at them, then the next scene, then the next etc.?  Depending on how much "GM's hidden story playing out" or "story made by play" game is, PC skills/attributes and Player choices should shape the availability of such threads and where they go.  What scenes follow should be shaped by Player choices and PC skills (e.g., PC skill at tracking may result in a particular scene, Player choice to apply that skill or do something else also matters).  Map-based dungeon adventures build at least some illusion of choice by having interesting maps that aren't just A to B to C, by creating the choice of old passage or new passage, Listen skill to hear dripping water and a blade sharpening this way or that.  Non-location-based adventures should still create roles for player choice and character skill in moving from scene to scene.<br/><br/>3) Does it "hit" player characters' goals, flags etc.?  Is it natural that they step up to the scene and pursue something more out of it into the next scene.  Either the content of the adventure should be malleable (e.g., a system that allows Players to author aspects of the adversity, or define themselves to be logical foes to that adversary, determine the adversary) or it should offer opportunities to purse previously indicated objectives (PC background already made this adversary one the PC would pursue).<br/><br/>4)  Is it believable that "this is happening in front of, to, around, these characters"? Some sort of campaign set up such as "Monster Hunters Inc.", "The Black Company", "a commissioned company of adventurers under Charter from their royal Majesties to make safe the realm" can provide a reliable basis for this - in TV shows, we know the homicide detectives will pursue murderers, the vampire slayer monsters, the crew of the ship barely meeting its debts the big money deal.  That's one reason the show can open showing a murder, monster or someone with something dangerous they need to smuggle - because we know where this is going.<br/><br/>5)  Does it reincorporate any "old favourites" or campaign elements or themes?  What makes it belong "in this campaign" not the last one or the next one, does it highlight this setting etc.?<br/><br/>Some of these questions really apply to all scenes.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125619/#Comment_125619" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T16:27:07+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  4:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeebus, Rob.  That's a lot of advice.   I think that might be more than I want to say to my potential Camaraderie GM.  <br/><br/>But off the top of my head:  <br/>1 - hard to capture. There is an Oracle at the beginning of the game, and a sort of "expansion oracle" after that.  I think that process is what establishes theme.<br/>2 - the "what are you doing when you aren't adventuring" is what I'm trying to use to encourage players to take the front seat on what kind of skill use interests them, but it does quickly fold into what the party is doing.<br/>3 - After the oracle step mentioned in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> the players create party goals.  They're also primed by their 4 phrases:  "How did I come through for the party when they needed me?"  "How did the party come through for me when I needed them?"  "Remember the time when we..."  "I want to see [good thing] happen to another party member."  That's supposed to prime the pump for the off-time scene, but also the goals are what the GM is supposed to make the game around.<br/>4 - Per 3, session setup goes "Oracle, make a party that's involved, make characters, start play."  If you have an existing party you either choose goals right off or keep drawing Oracle elements until you can write such goals.  So the believability is established right there because the session is designed around the assumption that you're playing a group involved in something conflict-heavy.<br/>5 - Old favorites are something I want to do with the oracle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125817/#Comment_125817" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T12:55:23+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 12:55PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>  I honestly just want them to act in a way that's in their collective best interests.  Adversity comes from without and I want the players to feel that pressure and do their level best to overcome it.</blockquote>\nSo the goal is to overcome a challenge through tactical choices?  Then the question becomes, is the info given useful for that goal?  If it's not, don't bother with it.  If it is, but can't be acted on without breaking the believability of how the characters are acting the way they do given that they don't now, then it's also probably best to avoid it.  <br/><br/>Also, you said "their collective best interests."  Who is "their"?  The party of characters?  The group of players?  And by "best interests" do you mean the party goals that are generated during party/character creation (like "find the treasure of V")?<br/><br/>If that's the case, and you want the players to act tactically in the character's best interest (achieving the goal) then any out of character knowledge you share in the opening scene should either be tactically useful, help set the tone, help drive towards the completion of their party goals from your previous post, etc.,.<br/><br/>I think one of the best uses of such a scene is to let the players know the characters are running against a clock.  A scene where the villain puts together the last of the materials for the dark ritual lets them see that their party goal of "c) stop the foul machinations of W" really needs to happen fast.  Then the question becomes, do they have to meet the tactical challenge before so many "turns" (however you want to define that, days, hours, weeks, something else) are up or the ritual goes off, or is it just a device for building tension and the ritual will commence at the speed of plot and no faster?<br/><br/>Is the game supposed to be "GM's hidden story playing out" or "story made by play" (to quote Rob)?  For example, is the players choose "find the treasure of V" have the oracles provided enough information to create the entire situation during play, or at that point, is the GM going to pull out his notes on a dungeon of V where the treasure is, figure out that Ol Jess the farm hand found a map to the dungeon but doesn't know what it is and other such details?<br/><br/>Earlier you said that "Each session is an adventure where a group of heroes work together to overcome threats and solve problems."  Who provides these threats and problems?  The oracles or does the GM prepare them in advance for each of the possible session choices?  If each session is a complete adventure, things need to move pretty rapidly.  The opening scene needs to drive things forward pretty fast.<br/><br/>I think any advice you give about opening scenes should probably be about driving play into conflict related to their chosen goal for the session as fast as possible.  If they choose "find the treasure of V" the opening scene should probably be something that actually rockets play in that direction.  "Assassins attacked me while I was petitioning the baron for tax relief" might not do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125819/#Comment_125819" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T12:59:58+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 12:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 1:00PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really quickly: The GM does not prepare anything before the game, but the oracle has two halves, an explicit situation half (that the player characters know about and which they use to make their goals) and a "hidden" half (that the GM draws which provides additional conflict).<br/><br/>Best interests = goals made in that process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125833/#Comment_125833" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T13:51:47+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 1:52PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>My wife pointed out that 4 is a subset of 1.</blockquote>\nNo.  Just fighting is a subset of 1.  Being attacked might not be something you do in your spare time.  However, starting off with a fight, because that's what you do, without the hook is another good way to start.  Only later is it revealed that that first fight was connected to the bigger events, but at the time it was just a regular fight.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>But I'm not a big fan of giving away the secret.  When I've tried "OK, you know this mysterious stranger just talked to your enemy, act like you don't know a thing." I get the same result as "you're attacked by thirty goblins, they ambushed you, act surprised."</blockquote>\nThen don't give away the secret. It's not a secret. It's something the PCs don't know and the players do. Use this to drive the action.  Telling players to act like they don't know a thing defeats the purpose. Instead, let them play their characters so their characters discover the information. Dramatic irony is fun.  I sometimes do things like "This guy is lying to you and out to betray you.  Your characters' don't know this." And what happens? Like in an action movie, usually the scum is found out, and either the betrayal happens anyway because its too late, or the traitor die. And up until then, everytime he says something that sounds helpful or kind they're gritting their teeth and going along but saying "This bastard is going to get it!"<br/><br/>If nothing is prepared in advance, I don't see why the GM needs secrets. If the guy is a traitor, no one knows that until its revealed. Maybe he was a good guy, then at the end of the game, the GM thinks to himself "Oh, you know what, it would be awesome if he was working for the sorcerer all along." And then says "He attacks you from behind with the axe you gave him."  Because there's no secrets, players can do this too.  If there secrets, they are limited ways they can't possible know.  Like, if a player picks the "traitor" and says "I'm his twin brother. We have a magical mental link and always know what the other thinks or feels no matter how far away."<br/><br/>Put the conflict on the table, regardless of whether the PCs know it or not so that the players can get full enjoyment of any dramatic irony.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125856/#Comment_125856" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T15:03:13+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  3:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 3:03PM by M Eryesen.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Really quickly: The GM does not prepare anything before the game, but the oracle has two halves, an explicit situation half (that the player characters know about and which they use to make their goals) and a "hidden" half (that the GM draws which provides additional conflict).<br/><br/>Best interests = goals made in that process.</blockquote>\nThen I think the scene framing advice, especially regarding the opening scene, should be to immediately set the situation so that it drives towards conflict as produced by the oracles.

It doesn't need to be a show all kind of a thing, but it needs to set up the situation in a way that can't be ignored.<br/><br/>Can you give a sample draw from the oracle for us (both the shared and hidden sides) along with some sample goals they might produce?

You'll probably get a lot more concrete responses if everything up to the point of the opening scene is a more clearly spelled out for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125863/#Comment_125863" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T15:30:56+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  3:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Then don't give away the secret.

Which is to say, they're used to the GM taking on the job of getting the party together and meshing, resolving intra-party conflict, and all those other things that lead to trad GM burnout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126023/#Comment_126023" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T13:04:34+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>Not every player really enjoys that dramatic irony.

But, I've never had a problem with "typical" scenes like that when I offloaded some of the traditional GM stuff onto them and trusted them to help make the story awesome. The example like that thief probably isn't a guy who enjoys being an asshole who needs to be tightly controlled, but he wants his character to have more power since that's the only method by which he can influence how the game progresses.<br/><br/>But that the fact is that if a GM has secrets that he's holding onto to reveal, it limits the ability for the players' to contribute.  Which is why the traditional mode of play limits players to playing their character and the GM to the story and everything is also one where we think that having big secrets the players need to discover is the way it should be done for most people. The option for people who dislike dramatic irony is still not to have any secrets fixed ahead of time, but reveal them as the moment arises ("Oh, it would make total sense and be awesome if this guy was a traitor all along, so, he is!").<br/><br/>Notice by not having hidden secrets, players and GMs can both easily contribute to revealing secrets - either as a dramatic irony ("My character is a robot, but no one knows that, not even himself") or as suits the story during play.  That's the point I'm getting at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126041/#Comment_126041" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:04:32+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am sorry.
