Essentially I have one of these "Exalted/Shadowrun" scenarios where there is a lush setting, an engaging situation and a crunchy/slow mechanic that I don't feel does justice to the game.  <br/><br/>Carl Rigney recently ran Don't Lose Your Edge, a Don't Rest Your Head port of Shadowrun.  I haven't heard any details yet but if Carl ran it I can be pretty sure it rocked.  Considering that I'm wondering if DRYH could be used or Werewolf.  Here's my simple premise.<br/><br/>Setting: Our world, 1999 and the world is about to end.  I mean like any minute now.<br/>Situation:  Garou are the worlds last hope for salvation and they have just discovered that they have been deceived, the Weaver is the cause of the Wrym's corruption and not the other way around.  Now, against all odds they must fight off the Weaver before the world is locked in stasis, destroying all life.<br/>Mechanics: Using the DrYH mechanics, dice have new names:\n<ul><li>Discipline = Willpower (I think this name is kind of weak, probably needs something else, but it represents the difference between a mortal (1 die) and a Garou (3 dice).</li>\n<li>Madness = Rage (it is very fitting that "Rage" dominating would cause a frenzy as the results are berserk (essentially fight) or fox (flight).  Taking other forms would require a minimum number of madness dice and each werewolf would have a Rage ability that they would define (I'm still thinking about what these would be)</li>\n<li>Exhaustion = Gnosis. This would be the ability that powers gifts, but I'm not sure the way it scales makes sense (i.e. unable to decrease it).  Personally it seems more fitting to use the scaling exhaustion mechanic for rage (representing that it is hard to calm down once you're full or rage) but that means either swapping pools or swapping components of the way the pools work and that seems dangerous.</li></ul>\nAny thoughts on DRYH for Werewolf?<br/><br/>Edited to correct the spelling of "Lose"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173565/#Comment_173565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T12:46:27+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:46PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Discipline should be Gnosis; it's what sets little piddly humans (1 die) apart from garou (3 dice).<br/><br/>Exhaustion doesn't map to anything specific in WoD; it would need to be something that tracks just how far, and how fucked, the world is, as represented by this one character.

I'd like to keep using the vernacular of the W:tA setting, so Apocalypse would work but I'm not sure how the characters would use it.   For a very dark game, taint would work, especially if it was built into the setting/situation that all garou have become tainted by this point, they have to use in order to survive, but succumbing to it will turn them into servants of the Wyrm...<br/><br/>Or just play that out further.  Instead of playing the "good werewolves" the player characters are Black Spiral Dancers that have been corrupted, were thought to be completely evil, but now realize the Wyrm was tricked by the Weaver and must fight against it. Their power comes from the Wyrm, which if indulged too much will completely consume them.

While rage certainly has the backlash of going to far, as does taint (see above) I don't think gnosis does, at least not in this setting.<br/><br/>That said bringing up the Umbra in comparison to the Mad City is a great idea.  I had presumed that this game would primarily take place in the material world (especially given the power of the Weaver in W:tA to wrap webs in the Umbra, completely trapping anyone who enters their domain).  However, using the Mad City as something of a template for the Umbra is really genius. Instead of a city filled with Nightmares, it's filled with banes (evil spirits) that have been woven into the weavers web are are now less a threat as they are guides to the city.  Instead of the needle nose hounds we have Weaver Webs.  Hmmm... would there be a bazaar?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173597/#Comment_173597" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T13:54:44+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  1:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep Discipline the same... it's self control and self mastery.  It plays a nice counter-point to the other forces.  <br/><br/>Rage is a good map for Madness.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>The mechanics for exaustion seem to fit Range better.  It builds up, gets stronger, makes you superhuman, but eventually you'll pop your lid.<br/><br/>Rage would accumulate just like Exhaustion.  Shape changing works through this, replacing talents.  Minor uses are the humanoid and near-human shape changes, or wolfy stuff while remaining mostly human.  Major uses involve changing your shape completely.  When you crash, it's death frenzy for you.<br/><br/>For madness, I'm thinking the analog should be something which combines spirit magic, social and spiritual obligation, taboo, honor... melding Gnosis with Renown.  <br/><br/>Call is Gnosis for ease of use, and use it for doing werewolfy spirit magic (have a Gift which defines your particular potencies).  When it dominates, you come under the sway of spiritual obligation, causing you to meet an Obligation.  Obligations are like responses, and you have two types- Taboo (something you can not do) and Gaesa (something you must do).  When you can accept no more Obligations (you can accept 2+ you Renown score... see below), one of your Discipline dice becomes a permanent Gnosis die- you're losing touch with your pack, and becoming more like a spirit.  When it replaces your Discipline completely, then you pass from the world completely.  <br/><br/>I'm also seeing Coins of the Man and Coins of the Beast.  <br/><br/>For Renown, you have as much as you have Scars.  More Renown means you can shoulder more obligations to the people or the spirit.  <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173602/#Comment_173602" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T14:16:27+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  2:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This I wha- woooooo!<br/><br/>I haven't tried Don't Rest Your Head and it's been several years since last I played (or even considered playing) Werewolf... but this sounds like it's gonna be really really cool.

These are the ideas that have gelled with me the most.<br/><br/>Discipline - Called whatever, it doesn't seem very interesting. Just sticking with Discipline will work.  Perhaps I can mine the W:tA books for something else.  Other thoughts right now are Gaia's Blessing, Garou, and Renown.<br/><br/>Madness - Rage.  I know the idea of it building (like exhaustion) is attractive, but think the fight/flight mechanic works better.  Need to go into Crinos (war form), you've got to roll at least 3 Rage dice.  If Rage dominates, you go fight or flight.  I think that is solid.  Your particular rage talent is something that is still a blank, however.  Going wolf is just part of the setting, so we might still want to add something to differentiate the players.  Perhaps the madness talent could correspond to the moon (Ragabash could have some stealth / sabotage type talent, Philidox some lie/justice detection, Galliard the ability to convince people, etc).  Frenzy to much and you become a monster. Solid.<br/><br/>Exhaustion \u2013 Gnosis - Your spiritual tie.  Each use of gifts/talking to spirits/passing into the Umbra makes you closer to the spiritual world, but drift too far and you loose touch with the real world.  It seems perfect for say, Scion (Legend rising forces you to the Overworld) but still not sold on it in Werewolf.  The crux of the problem here is that in W:tA there is really only one way a garou will usually self destruct and that is through rage.  In general being more connected with the spirits is seen as a good thing.  What do you guys think about the above taint idea as a replacement?  Taint of the Wyrm is pretty brutal indeed, possibly too brutal.  Maybe just fuse the ideas and say that the spirits have become tainted so the closer you get to them, the more tainted you become?  <br/><br/>Pain - Corruption.  All that is fucked up with the world around you, ranging from the two guys who just saw you change and instead of running will pull out their buck knives and come for you (Corruption 1) to a pack of elder Black Spiral Dancers lead by an legendary abomination (Corruption 10).<br/><br/>I also really like Bailywolfs coins idea.  I hadn't thought about that, but I think coins of man and coins of beast are perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173614/#Comment_173614" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T15:02:13+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  3:02PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 3:03PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me that I need to finish up my "Hacking DRYH" blog-article, which I started here:<br/><a href="http://macklinr.livejournal.com/579439.html" rel="nofollow">http://macklinr.livejournal.com/579439.html</a><br/><br/>Linked in case it helps you out any, Sean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173652/#Comment_173652" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T17:09:27+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  5:09PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 5:13PM by Bailywolf.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Picking your rage analog (the slow build, total freak-out VS the situational build, small freakout) is one of those table preferences, I think... it depends on how big a deal (and how often) you want things to blow up and go totally out of control.  <br/><br/>Doing Gnosis as the exhaustion analog has some neat imlications for sure- as persistent gnosis increases... actually, I'm going to call it Essence... ass persistent Essence increases, your obligations and depts to the spirit world increase, until you're forced to go make good on them (the crash analog).  <br/><br/>I played with Vampire here in <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=362329" rel="nofollow">Don't Quench Your Thirst</a>...

It gets eroded by Hubris, the Madness analog.<br/><br/>Mystery is the Exhaustion analog.  You use it for subtle magic.  It builds up, making you more arcane, bringing you into closer proximity to the Supernal (and the abyss)- a crash is a convulsive mystical revelation which gives you a taste of true reality, and then flings you back down into the mud of reality.  <br/><br/>Then we have Hubris used for doing vulgar magic.  Works just like Madness- used for fat crackling obvious power.  Want to animate the Statue of Liberty?  Here you go.  Responses for Hubris are Dominate or Paradox- either impose your will, and take control, or suffer some kind of external reality backlash.  Basically, be a dick, or take one on the chin.    <br/><br/>If you wanted to map things tighter, from the Splat+Splat then Path gives you the mundane skills you use like Exhaustion talents, and Order gives you the Arcana which you use like Madness talents.  <br/><br/>The Coins would obviously be Supernal and Abyssal.  <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173690/#Comment_173690" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T22:38:35+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea.

At the start, a garou has no rage.  He gets into a conflict and calls upon his rage to make him more powerful.  This works and has the added danger of making him even madder (rage dominating).  Each time he leaves his rage unchecked (i.e. doesn't take a period of rest (or maybe something else more difficult to find in WOD) the rage will grow.  It starts as a slow simmer and ramps up (as rage becomes more likely to dominate the more dice you have) to a boil.  <br/><br/>So, how does the player represent changing form? Strictly narrative? Minimum number of Rage dice? Making a Major use of rage? <br/><br/>And what happens when they "crash"? Is that a berserk frenzy?  That doesn't seem to remove the character the way exhaustion should.  Do the enter the "Thrall of the Wyrm" and attack their allies?  Or do they have a some kind of condition (heart attack, stroke, chest cavity exploding) that debilitates them long term?  Maybe they just become wild and run off into the woods?<br/><br/>That begs the question of a rage talent.  Here are some ideas but to be fun I think they would need to be either much broader or more flexible.<br/><br/>Minor use of rage - Changing forms, using wolf senses. <br/>Major use of rage - Superhuman levels of strength or speed                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174015/#Comment_174015" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T01:00:42+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd figure that when they crash, they're like a berserker after the berserk passes - helpless for a bit until they recover.<br/><br/>I'd probably leave wolf-form as color, and let players define what their Rage Talent and Gnosis Talent were, for variety.<br/>If someone wants their Rage Talent to be "Furry killing machine", that's easy enough, but I'd leave the door open for other concepts as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
