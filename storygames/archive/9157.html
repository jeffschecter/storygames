I surprised myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bulleted lists in GHOST/ECHO were what jazzed me the most, so I emulated that. I actually had longer lists than what's in here, but decided to cut them down.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo elaborate on the gaming-related influences:<br/>\nJohn Harper:  getting this party started<br/>\nVincent Baker: dice mechanic in Otherkind, and Cruel Fortunes in Poison'd (which you can kinda see in the way that one Condition can lead to another)<br/>\nLuke Crane: Shades and Tests in Burning Wheel; if you squint, you can see that the number of Complications in this is actually the same as the Obstacle in BW<br/>\nRon Edwards: Binding rules in Sorcerer<br/>\nDavid Berg: a conversation about another project of mine (American Wizards) that led directly to the Complication/Interference/Danger schema.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the pictures in this are Captain Beefheart stuff. That's the Captain himself with the trout (Spirit?) coming out of his saxophone on P1. On the left of P1, we have The Mascara Snake, who played guest bass clarinet on the <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> album. Low left on P1 we have a photo of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band in scary costumes, from the album <i>Strictly Personal</i>. On P2, we have guitarist Zoot Horn Rollo, from a picture from TMR.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name "Lunar Notes" comes from the Captain Beefheart song "Big Eyed Beans From Venus," in which the Captain commands Zoot Horn Rollo to "hit that long, lunar note, and let it float."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, whaddya think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202585/#Comment_202585" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-18T10:27:52+00:00" title="April 18, 2009 10:27AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your files don't work on my PC, sorry.  \u0e23\u0e07_\u0e23\u0e07<br><br>Weird, since my Adobe Reader's new &amp; shiny.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202595/#Comment_202595" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-18T13:18:18+00:00" title="April 18, 2009  1:18PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool, Marshall.

That's weird. I don't understand why that would happen. Although, see below how I made them, and perhaps it will shed some light on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn,<br/>\nThanks! Yeah, the Black Rider would be absolutely perfect as part of a Lunar Notes soundtrack. For my version of it, Tom Waits alone isn't enough, because, like Beefheart, my version has a delicate mix of the serious and the silly, with a sort of fantastic line that makes the silly seem equally plausible. But that's just my version.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as for how I did it:<br/>\nUpon announcing that I would do it, I looked for pictures for about two days. I only used a few, as you can see, but having a lot of them to work with helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote it and did the layout in about twelve or so hours on my day off, give or take some time for smoke breaks, since I smoke but don't smoke inside. First I wrote out all the text in Word. Actually, I wrote all the text I could think of, and selected from that what would actually go in (the original lists are like, twice as long, and there was also a list of food for Spirits that didn't go in).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the layout using Macromedia Fireworks (which sounds weird, but bear with me). I then pasted it into PhotoShop, from which I saved the pages as PDFs. This is because I don't have layout software, I'm more comfortable with Fireworks than PhotoShop, and PhotoShop is the only software I have that can save as a PDF. This is also why each page is a separate file.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fabrizio" title="Fabrizio"><img alt="Fabrizio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fabrizio">Fabrizio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202745/#Comment_202745" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T09:31:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  9:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 9:33AM by Fabrizio.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Marshall Burns[/cite]I did the layout using Macromedia Fireworks (which sounds weird, but bear with me).

Eventually one guy got a hold of Vampire, so that was an influence for him later, and I was also later heavily influenced by a host of old computer games, but, to start with, we had no idea what we were doing, so we could do anything.<br><br>And that "anything" was an awful lot like this, because we didn't have time to do 100 pages of spell lists and setting history or whatever the fuck; just some assortments of notes, a few mechanics (maybe), and some half-formed notions and ideas, that led to discoveries <i>in play</i> for everyone, creator and other players alike.<br><br>(Later on, in high school, I became a system-monkey and started doing some quite rules-heavy design, but that was later)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202967/#Comment_202967" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T10:29:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 10:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I tried Wikispaces; guys, give these a try:<br><br><a href="http://beyondthewireproductions.wikispaces.com/file/view/LunarNotesP1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Page one</a><br><a href="http://beyondthewireproductions.wikispaces.com/file/view/LunarNotesP2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Page two</a> </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203116/#Comment_203116" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T09:57:58+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  9:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It now works for me.

I've been interested for a while in a sort of DIY/punk aesthetic for small games, and it's cool to see people putting together their little homebrew doodads in a pdf and letting other people see what they've done. Also, the blatant and encouraged grabbing of ideas from other games is pretty much entirely how I "design," so it's fun to see that get some play.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203289/#Comment_203289" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T09:57:00+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  9:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what I'm thinking about doing with this?<br/><br/>Partly, fleshing it out slightly, to maybe, say, 5 pages.

Who gets to fill them in?" In my group, we would have no problem working that out on our own. But of course it ain't gonna be the same for others.
