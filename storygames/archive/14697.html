It takes guts to put yourself out there like that, but it was the perfect thing for a newbie like me (or Story-Game-Star-yet-to-Be-Born as we say in Oly). <br/><br/><br/><br/>Crunch is great (let\u2019s get some more of it), but I crave informed criticism of individual play style. <br/><br/>There are subtle skills used during most Story Games, beyond just following the rules and being able to repeat the crunch. I\u2019m brand new to this stuff, so when Kevin and Clyde had a critical discussion about Clyde's GMing, it was illuminating. In fact, it was like watching a playback of a sports game with a learned observer. <br/><br/>Of course, mad props to <i>Actual People, Actual Play</i>, natch, but even more than a discussion of mechanics, I crave personal criticism. There are two ways to get this: Asking those who game with me to provide aggressive critiques or to listen to others get the same and try to apply it to myself. As you may expect, it is difficult to get the folks I game with to be honest and mean. If we are friends, no one wants to hurt each other\u2019s feelings; if we are just acquaintances, no one wants to be a jerk. Additionally, I am not always playing with experienced Story Gamers.<br/><br/>That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping that the great intar-web can hook me up and give me experienced players who I wouldn\u2019t have access to normally, giving each other serious criticism about their play style. It takes courage and it could get heated, but I listen to how smart and dedicated you all are and I know two things:<br/><br/>1. You can do it<br/>2. Because you are the s-bomb.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334243/#Comment_334243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T11:49:00+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 11:49AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a fairly awesome episode.

So, you'd listen to them play, then they would give each other feedback. It was enjoyable.<br/><br/>I've tried really freaking hard to get critique and feedback on my GMing from close friends and random strangers with little to no success. I crave that kind of discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
