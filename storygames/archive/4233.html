While it's true I like my games emotionally bleak and taxing and I don't think of them as "Emo."  "Emo" to me carries with it a slight connotation of self-inflicted disingenuous angst.  So I retorted casually that I was going to design and "Emo-Punk" game just to show him the difference.<br/><br/>Then inspiration struck.  Inspiration that wouldn't let go.  So in a few hours I banged out:<br/><br/><a href="http://bloodthorn.livejournal.com/50962.html" rel="nofollow">Misunderstood: The RPG of Friendship Against the Harsh Cruel World</a><br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>1) I've grown really fond of this game.  I have a lot of sympathy for the characters it's about and really want to see them succeed and salvage their friendships.  I showed it to Joshua and he brought up the example of the "furry" trying to explain to his parents why he needed a fur suit.  That's pretty much stuck in my head since then.  It's perfect.<br/><br/>2) I really want the game to be about the tension of being a safe "loner" (Taking on the World Scenes) and the more rewarding but also more complex route of tackling life together as friends (Friendship Scenes).  Defeating The Harsh Cruel World should be harder than having the friends simply dissolve because they can't deal with each others' bullshit.<br/><br/>3) In reference to number two above my big fear with the current design is that Friendship Score don't matter enough.  It took two tries to get Friendship Scenes to produce the Diplomacy-esq co-operate or betray mechanic right and I think they currently works as intended but only if you care about Friendship Points.  Outreach scenes are currently in the same boat.  Would anyone do an Outreach scene if they didn't have to?<br/><br/>4) Part of me wants a mechanic where the player actually declares, "I'm so misunderstood!" and then does something mechanically drastic... but I don't know what.  My current crude thoughts are that they return half their Understanding points to The Cruel Harsh World to refresh all their Friendship Points.  But again,  I don't know if Friendship Points matter that much.  I also don't know if this is overkill possibly removing all subtlety from the game.<br/><br/>5) Ultimately I think this would make a nice little pamphlet game.  The kind of think you pick up for 3-5 dollars.<br/><br/>Feedback would be greatly welcome and I'd be honored if anyone actually took the time to play it.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
