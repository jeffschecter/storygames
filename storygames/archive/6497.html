This is an rpg."  I would just say, "Hey let's play one right now!"  but sometimes that doesn't work.  for many reasons.  i've met quite a few people that are a little curious when i talk about gaming, but also are, for whatever reason, kind of wary about actually trying it.  i was talking to a friend online just now and brought them up and she said something like "You'll have to show me one sometime."  There's a good chance she was just being polite, but it got me thinking, "If she's willing to actually take a look at something, what might be likely to grab her interest and also give her an idea of what some of these things are like."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143840/#Comment_143840" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T22:14:09+00:00" title="May 13, 2008 10:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I show non-gamers Primetime Adventures.

It's written in a very approachable style, it's really interesting, it's got great examples that illustrate the act of roleplaying in it.  You can gloss over the intricacies of how dice work and what the terms are and still see what people actually do at the table, and in the fiction.  So if your friend wants to understand what roleplaying is about, it is instructive - you typically portray a character in a setting and face adversity - and <i>Dogs </i>shows all that clearly.  It also sends the message that the activity of roleplaying isn't confined to only one kind of adolescent power fantasy, but can embrace many kinds of adolescent power fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143905/#Comment_143905" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T07:11:02+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:11AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 7:12AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Show them Polaris, introducing it like, "This is a unique little RPG that personally blew my mind."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... frankly I think that RPG texts are unlikely to make play more attractive to somebody who doesn't understand how to play. Very likely the opposite. Like studying to have fun. A good tone in the text might counteract this. But I think that typically this is not true. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've done on occasion is this little exercize. I actually do some "hypothetical" character generation. Like:<br/>\n<br/>\nMike's Friend: I still don't get what these RPG things really are about. <br/>\nMike: OK, let's just create a hypothetical character, quick, and then I can give you a better idea. <br/>\nFriend: OK, how do we do that?<br/>\nMike: We'll use a really easy system called "Over the Edge." First you select a central concept for the character, like "Reclusive Businessman" or "Desperate Housewife." Somebody who might have a reason to flee to a little-known Mediterranean island. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinish with chargen and then say stuff like:  <br/>\n<br/>\nMike: OK, let's say we started play with this character. I, as the guy running the game, would come up with a situation on arrival at the little-known Mediterranean island to which you would then dictate the character's response. Like I would tell you that he's arrived, but his luggage is missing, and he gets the feeling somehow that the loss isn't accidental. Then you'd tell me what your character would do?<br/>\nFriend: Like I could have him go to the desk to inquire about it.. right? <br/>\nMike: Exactly. Then I tell you that your character sees that one of the desk attendants has a strange pin on, that one that's associated with the conspiracy that you mentioned in your character's "secret." <br/>\nFriend: Ah, I see, and then I have to decide whether I should run or press him about my luggage?<br/>\nMike: Yeah, or whatever you think is plausible and entertaining for the character to do in that situation. Then we just continue this back and forth. <br/>\nFriend: Cool, how often do you play? <br/>\nMike: well I have a game every Thursday night...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea. Basically actually play, but just co-opt them into doing so by telling them that it's just an "example" to illustrate. That way they can go into it with plausible deniability (they can feel that they would not have to say afterwards that they had played a RPG). Once they get it, they'll be too interested in all likelihood to need that excuse... you could even form your game around the character and situation you had created. But it allows them to be more comfortable going in that they're not joining the "cult," but just observing it's ways. Once they see it's not a cult, they'll probably be interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that's been my experience. I think that doing an exercize like the above, and answering questions asked by the potential player, is a far better way to introduce somebody to RPGs than to toss them a book. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143918/#Comment_143918" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T07:55:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideally, Jason, I'd like to both inform AND recruit.

I find RPG books fascinating even if I may never play or run them because I'm moderately obsessed with interesting ways to create and experience stories, and RPGs are that.  But if someone doesn't have that kind of interest, isn't really curious about them, or the actual text of the book isn't genuinely fun to read for its own sake (and very few, if any, RPG books are, frankly) it could very well turn them away.  I really like your idea of trying it in a very simple, quick way that still shows the core of the concept... that's really cool and not something I'd ever considered doing.  I usually end up trying to explain it myself (and generally doing a poor job) then trying to gently convince someone to actually come to a new game which is always a more serious time commitment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143927/#Comment_143927" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:14:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Poison'd</b> or <b>Contenders</b>, in addition to the others mentioned here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner" title="Books Burner"><img alt="Books Burner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/2913/avwg2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner">Books Burner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143928/#Comment_143928" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:16:27+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that the pool and others minimalistci systems are good for beginer.

GURPS as well, though its system is a bit more to bite off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143985/#Comment_143985" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T11:45:54+00:00" title="May 14, 2008 11:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think with most roleplaying games, the selling point is the setting rather than the mechanics.

Hook them with something they like and are interested in, then bring in the "game" portion. If they love pirates, find pirate-themed RPGs. Etc. And you are absolutely right. Not everyone is into sword and sorcery. But I have seen non-gamers react really well to having something tangible, like a mini, to hold in hand. It reminds them of a toy and gives them something physical to play with and to manipulate, to represent what is going on in their minds. <br/><br/>I've found one of the biggest hurdles to getting non-gamers into RPGs is getting them past that initial "lets play pretend" phase. Intro'ing it through something more familiar, like a board game, has helped me to get people interested in roleplaying who would have turned their noses in the air had I said "roleplaying game."<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144009/#Comment_144009" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T13:19:16+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  1:19PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I actually would suggest something like the most recent D&amp;D basic boxed set, which is closer to a board game with role-playing elements.

Everyone loves minis.<br/></blockquote>\nWell I think I phrased my initial post in a fairly generic way, and I meant to keep the discussion pretty general.  But it was sparked by me talking to a friend of mine at my university online last night.  She's an english major, like I was, and somehow (don't remember exactly now) we got onto the subject of general geekiness.  She said that she liked geeks but not the kind that love computers and computer games, and especially railed against WoW a little.  I said that my favorite hobby was probably even geekier and then talked a little about tabletop RPGs.  She said she had some idea what they were but said she didn't really understand and that I ought to bring her one to see sometime (hence the spark for my forum post).<br/><br/>Given that she hates WoW, I'm pretty sure D&amp;D with minis wouldn't interest her at all.  Given that she's an english major, in theory, she might be interested in something with more of a core concept of "We're all making a story together."  Beyond those two assumptions, I have no idea what might best serve to either "recruit" this person or even "educate" her.  She's a fairly new friend so I don't really know what kind of movies and books she likes.  Though she apparently just finished reading a book about girls at a prep school that she was enjoying so maybe...

And the game is framed in by something almost everyone is familiar with: television.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144169/#Comment_144169" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T08:48:35+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  8:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>Actually, you just echoed my argument.</blockquote>\nActually, you both just echo MY suggestion:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Which makes me think that, "strategically," I'd want to know what sorts of fiction or settings (or time periods, whatever) really interest the person, and then try to find a basic system for playing such stories.</blockquote>\n...which is, I feel, the best starting point.

Given that she's an English major, in theory, she might be interested in something with more of a core concept of "We're all making a story together."</blockquote>\nFor instance, I was an English major--my focus was semantic and diction. You couldn't guess my "lit" interests just from that, at the time or now. As it turn sout, "making a story" would be a good approach, as I also enjoyed creative writing. but I've know English majors would never would write a story and struggle with a paper on linguistics (which is their REAL focus).<br/><br/>So, again (for the fourth time) ask her about specific genres: movies, books (you've read), TV, favorite plays--whatever. THEN, maybe, I'd dig into her interest in proactive creation ("writing"), or strategic play, or reactive play. Even if she likes to write fiction, maybe she'd not want to do that when "relaxing" with a game? (Even Tom Sawyer couldn't convince a house painter to "play" Tom's whitewash-the-fence game.) Maybe she'd like a railroad plot with discrete, meaningful choices (Pick A Path To Adventure-style), for starters. (Yeah, yeah, BLASPHEMY! ILLUSIONISM!

To a lesser extent I would have this objection to Dogs (which while short compared to D&amp;D or a WW book or what-have-you, is still a significantly longer text than some indie games).  Since I'm dealing with someone who is, at best, currently only mildly curious, I'd want to stick with someone short.  Both "recruitment" and education would fail if she just said, "Ugh.  This is too long.  I'm not even going to look at it."<br/><br/>All in all, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that the people who have said giving someone a book is probably a bad way to both recruit and inform are right.  It really does sound like the only good way to do it is to actually try to play.  I have trouble imagining someone being completely unwilling to consider playing who could have their mind changed by just reading anything, and if someone is at least somewhat open to the idea, it shouldn't be THAT hard to talk them into trying a one shot of something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar" title="kleenestar"><img alt="kleenestar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.replayable.net/pics/kleenestar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar">kleenestar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144338/#Comment_144338" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T19:17:40+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  7:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done a lot of introducing non-gamers to play in the last few months, and I'm surprised no one has suggested my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> absolute go-to game: <b>The Mountain Witch</b>.  Depending on the potential players' interests, you can spin it heavily toward ghost story, samurai story, historical drama, or soap-operatic relationship stuff.  That means you only have to be an expert in pitching/explaining one game to hit a lot of potential players' interests.  The system is totally understandable and the back of the book provides really nice supports for play.  As a text, I've also found it very readable/accessible for new players.  In practice, it's been hugely successful - to the point where I've given away four copies of the book in the past year to brand-new players asking to take it home and show it to their friends.  Strongly recommended.<br/><br/>I love <b>Nobilis</b>, but it is severely intimidating to new players unless you are playing with an experienced group.  The rules are relatively easy to learn but getting your head around <i>what you do</i> is shockingly tough.  Again, this is my experience as a very active introducer-of-RPGs-to-non-geeks.  They love it, but it's not a book you can hand people without adding some social capital of your own.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144342/#Comment_144342" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T19:38:36+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  7:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this thread started by me asking what <i>book</i> i could potentially just hand to a non-gamer.

While I believe that it could very well be a great game to use to introduce new players to RPGs, I have serious doubts that it would be a good book to show someone who doesn't know anything.  When I first read The Mountain Witch I was pretty damn confused because it uses a lot of terms and concepts without ever really explaining them.  On the other hand, I suppose it's <i>possible</i> (though personally I doubt it) that much of my confusion was due to my trad RPG background and a total non-gamer wouldn't have those confusions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144724/#Comment_144724" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T08:48:50+00:00" title="May 18, 2008  8:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2008 8:50AM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, show 'em Dust Devils.

The rules are relatively easy to learn but getting your head around<i>what you do</i>is shockingly tough.  Again, this is my experience as a very active introducer-of-RPGs-to-non-geeks.  They love it, but it's not a book you can hand people without adding some social capital of your own.</blockquote>\nI would have thought that too. But I brought it into work once after I got it, and had the reaction chearns had, people wanting to know more. So I ended up handing it to people for them to read during breaks or whatever, and after about a week or two, I had 5 or 6 players making characters to play after work. They were all video gamers (its what you get at a video game company) but none of them were role-playing gamers. I was there to answer questions, and passed out the "So You've Been EnNobled" flyer, but I didn't have to put much effort into it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144918/#Comment_144918" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T13:05:39+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  1:05PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's super cool!<br/>But I don't have <i>Nobilis</i>, something that makes me very sad.
