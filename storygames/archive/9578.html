The things you're constantly thinking of...  <br/>Often-times players just don't realize the immensity of what you're actually DOING when you're GMing  (at least the way I GM).  The many many things you're referencing and planning in mind while seemingly sitting listening to a player's turn...  GMing can be a stressful "job" for people who don't like, aren't suited to handle, or just don't like dealing with a big handful of things coming at them at once.  I liken it to driving in heavy city-traffic... some people just can't *not* be stressed by it.  Some people (like me) don't even think about it... it's just how it is,  so it's not stressful  (though it is challenging)  to manage.<br/><br/>I love Game Mastering.... perhaps my mind is better suited for it that playing.  I'm not suggesting I'm any smarter, etc... but I do think my brain functions better with multi-tasking.  And to me... that's a key essential for a good GM to boarder on being a great GM.  Handling the variety of things that come at any given minute in an RPG session with grace and lack of stress so that your players don't feel any angst.  Do you know what I mean?  If someone walks into a room and they're just having a BAD day - everyone in the room can *FEEL* it... it brings a burden on the energy of the room.  Same goes for stress when gaming - and if the GM feels pushed sometimes that can reflect of the enjoyment of the game for everyone....  What I'd like to hear is your examples of what you multi-task in a given "round" of a game and thoughts on how you feel you display a certain amount of cool as to not stress your players...  OR do you have a breaking point?  Maybe even give examples of bad breaks when the GM version of "road rage" took over...  Here's my examples of an average "round" and one example of my "road rage":<br/><br/><br/><br/>ON ANY GIVEN ROUND...<br/>"okay... Top of the initiative, Eric... what does Egan do?..."<br/>As Eric begins describing his character's actions I am:<br/>-  listening for key points of his actions for rule interpretations<br/>-  while he's explaining his actions I'll grab my rule book or monster stat to look up the rule for my NPC's next power or action to reference<br/>-  considering how these actions effect and change my various NPCs<br/>-  I roll for any checks needed for the NPCs in reaction  (Fortitude Saving Throw = success!)<br/>-  I ask everyone for a spot check  (see below)<br/>-  considering how these actions require new description of the environment  (does firing his gun scare civilians/animals, or hit something in the background, etc..)<br/>-  after listening to his actions, ask for his "cool description" of his actions as well as any dialogue his character would say  (it is a ROLE-playing game afterall!)<br/>-  after he describes actions and dialogue Eric hands me a secret wipe-board telling me what the actual name of the spell he just cast was  (I like to keep it secret so others can...)<br/>-  I ask other's at the table to make a spellcraft check to maybe get a hint at what spell Eric's character just cast,  at the same time rolling for any NPCs as necessary<br/>-  meanwhile Adam has just handed me a secret wipe-board note for a question he wants answered so he can react on his initiative appropriately<br/>-  meanwhile Jason's just handed me another secret wipe-board to tell me what his invisible character is doing <br/>-  quickly glance at the initiative board to note  "Jason's character is up next"  so he is reminded to have his action ready to go on his initiative...<br/>-  I gather the appropriate Miniature (or counter) needed for the next NPC villain coming on scene<br/>-  from the spot check requested (above) I mention what characters "see" in the background that an NPC is doing that might effect their next turn<br/>-  cackling (in-character) I role-play the dialogue of the NPC villain spouting off:  "you fool, do your really think...."<br/>-  all the while listening and glancing at my iTunes playlist to make sure an appropriately actiony tune is playing for the battle<br/>-  when that new NPC is seen (with the spot check) sneaking in for an assassin attack, I quickly "google image" up the picture of an actor to give a visual of the new NPC on my TV screen for players to see<br/>-  grabbing my energy drink to sit back from the action....<br/>-  finally I describe any reaction from the NPC of the PC's action in "cool description"  -  "sand and cobblestones crack as the monster lurches back revealing...."<br/>-  NEXT initiative...  (and repeat!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the only times I hit my limits when dealing with all of the above in a "road rage" type moment came when:<br/>-  one player (who'd been snarking at my style and actions as a GM for the last 3 games)  said...   "...that's just stupid"<br/>I snapped and said - "what's your Fing problem man??  Why are you being such a jerk???"<br/><br/>To which I said - game session OVER.... noting that I just am not having fun with this kind of behavior...<br/><br/>The point came when I saw that a player for some reason was just not willing to try and have fun...  Making things difficult for me as a GM to deal with as well as making things unfun for other players at the table.  This has happened to me about 4 times in the last 10 years.  Twice I actually ENDED the session.  Twice I relaxed and talked it through with the player in question.  <br/>I'm usually fairly good about DROPPING the angst when in that kind of situation.<br/><br/>I try (as the "leader" of the group)  to actively show the willingness to be honest with my feelings and "forgive" any slight at the table.  I've often felt the angsty heat in a game from snarky comments or rule arguments and simply let the emotion happen to a point  THEN  step back and verbally say.... "okay... we're all here to have fun.  I apologize... I'm now DROPPING my angst.  Let's have some fun"  and strangely - once I say that it give myself (and the group) the option and ability to truly forgive and forget.  Saying it aloud helps everyone...  And sometimes  (I feel)  being the GM, it's your job to allow yourself to be the one willing to apologize so the angst can slide away.  It takes alot of confidence to do... some people just aren't willing to "look weak" and swallow their pride to admit being wrong......  But for me... it helps the game and the group.  That's one of the differences between being a good GM and a great GM - to me... leading by example.<br/><br/><br/>thoughts??<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212467/#Comment_212467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T16:25:58+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  4:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is tough! <br/><br/>I\u2019ll try to list what usually goes through my head. <br/><br/>Position myself farthest away from the loudest players, closest to the quieter players. <br/><br/>Am I talking too much?

I completely agree with your notion of repeating names and injecting elements.  I've seen GMs that don't attempt to "ingrain" in-game names and such into their players by repeating ...  but rather saying  "the fighter does..."  instead of referring to his name.  I've found this is even true with player characters.  If you (as GM) makes constant note to call them by NAME it really helps the other players get a hold of each other PC.<br/>I also make sure to write names on my "initiative board"  even if we're not in combat/action,  so that Players can SEE the names and glance to reference them when role-playing instead of stopping the flow to ask  "what was that guy's name"  and that's ONLY if you've pushed the group to "want" to call NPCs by name, etc...<br/>Another trick I tend to do for this is have different NPCs refer to characters in different ways.  Depending on the style of the NPC they may call a PC by their first name... or last name, or class, job, race, etc... and many times you can "show" the emotion of the NPC if they CHANGE what they usually call a character.  For example - an antagonist may generally call a PC by his profession  "Broker"  but when trying to manipulate them they may switch to first name basis  "Gundter"...  or the same in reverse...  they may show respect calling them "Mayor Boragrych"  vs.  showing disrespect and calling them by first name...  or even disdain in referring to their class in a derogatory way  "... foolish ranger"<br/><br/>All of this and the things you mention here really take a step toward flavoring the game toward a deeper story.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Don\u2019t ask questions that aren\u2019t questions.

It's my opinion that this type effort makes a good "story" as opposed to the players feeling like they're in an "adventure".  <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Why is this NPC the way they are?

Knowing the general flavor of the NPC can help you to be able to respond to almost any surprise and seem like a natural reaction that stays in-character and appropriate to the personality you're building.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Cut to the next scene when things slows down.<br/>Show don't tell!

Re-explaining likely won\u2019t make it more interesting.<br/><br/>- Maybe it\u2019s too complicated. Re-explaining assumes if I explain the same content just right it will work. Maybe the content is the problem. I may need a moment to re-examine if I need to simplify the details.<br/><br/>- Does re-explaining help? I\u2019m not sure what part is the problem because I don\u2019t have enough data. So I need to get more data. But asking for it directly may not work. Best thing is to move on to a situation where the information communicated is relevant and if it is not understood, it will quickly become apparent. At which point the players may become more interested in understanding.
