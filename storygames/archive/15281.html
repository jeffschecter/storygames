It'll be the first time I've run the game - or even played it, in fact. I've listened to AP podcasts with it and reread it a few days ago to prepare. I'm planning to do a fairly simple/standard/typical thing where the PCs start in a group therapy session for insomnia and then things start going crazy. I'll be trying on the fly to create Nightmare concepts for each PC and to tie those Nightmares together in some way, possibly attaching them to existing Nightmares from the game (in the interest of getting it all done in one night). Some of the players submitted character concepts ahead of time so I've been combing over them looking for common themes.<br/><br/>Any recommendations?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347201/#Comment_347201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T02:12:44+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  2:12AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just saw this, so I didn't get a chance to offer advice.

It's definitely a lot easier to run the game if the PCs have some overlap and interaction, but I don't think it's worth ditching 'What just happened?' and all the excellent situation that it tends to generate.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend jettisoning the book setting completely and working entirely with the situation and weirdness that the players generate through their Madness talents and starting situation. <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Oh, whoops, I wrote all that before realizing that you had already run the session! I leave it for postery &amp; other interested parties, and echo orklord's question -- I'm wondering how it went, particularly the starting-them-all-in-group-therapy part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347210/#Comment_347210" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T05:07:57+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  5:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2011 5:09AM by ivan.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [deleted because of.. ops wrong thread]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347226/#Comment_347226" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T09:11:27+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  9:11AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It went very well! The players came up with very cool characters. They had a little trouble getting their heads around the two-layer dice rolls (the concepts of which at first were causing the PLAYERS to experience Exhaustion and Madness) but they eventually started getting the gist of it. They had a lot of fun with it.<br/><br/>I didn't completely ditch the "What Just Happened to You?" aspect but stated instead that it was something that had occurred to each of the PCs in their recent past. The main reason I started them in a group therapy session was because it was a one-shot and I had five players who'd never played the game before (or anything remotely like it). While I'd have loved to spin each individual "What Just Happened..." moment into its own starting scene, there just wouldn't have been enough time. They all seemed to enjoy the opening of the game, though, using it as a convenient way to introduce everyone's characters to each other. (At the end of which the psychiatrist - who'd already been showing signs of stress and strangeness - went nuts, leaped through a door in the office that he'd claimed wasn't supposed to be there, and all hell broke loose.)  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347267/#Comment_347267" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T17:44:57+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  5:44PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great.
