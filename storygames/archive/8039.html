Regular updates are also in the pipeline, so check back often or sign up for our newsletter.<br/><br/>Our licenses are extremely simple. Each purchase allows the non-exclusive single use within one product. This is the barest baseline of use we could come up with, which allows us to give the cheapest possible price. Our filler and spot art is sold under a wider license which allows reuse within one product. Which seemed only fair!<br/></blockquote>\nAnyway, Jon posted this today on the Collective Endeavour and the Forge and I thought the design community here would be interested in this too.<br/><br/>I personally have worked with these guys before and know them. Their work has graced books from D&amp;D, Warhammer, all the way down to Dust Devils, Spione and George's Children. They are high-quality artists and the prices are designed to be affordable for an Indie Games Designer's budget.<br/><br/>I'll be using an image from the Deli for a forthcoming project with Epidiah Ravachol, and I hope you find something you like there too. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
