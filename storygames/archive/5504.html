So here I am.  <br/><br/>This year at Origins and GenCon I'm running Artesia: Adventures in the Known World.  The scenario happens to be a sequel to the game I ran last year, but no experience with the previous scenario is necessary.  <br/><br/>This is the current description:<br/><br/><i>Title: The Labyrinthine Path<br/>System:  Artesia: Adventures in the Known World<br/>Number of players: 4 to 6 <br/>Ages: 18+ (for nudity)<br/>rules taught<br/><br/>The everyday quiet of your farming village was shattered the afternoon you discovered what lurked in the neighboring forest - a malevolent portal to the Otherworld.  The townsfolk are in turmoil.  They want to summon help but from whom?  Priestesses of the Cult of Yhera, Inquisitors of the Divine King, vassal warriors of the local lords; all have been suggested but none called upon, for each group could bring as much trouble as they could safety.  A decision must be made before your friends and family decide to take things into their own hands.</i><br/><br/>It's a bit world specific since I mention the Otherworld, the Cult of Yhera &amp; the Divine King by name.  Since I'm always interested in introducing the game to new players, is that a detriment?  <br/><br/>I'd also like to add something about how I'm using The Book of Dooms (Artesia's Tarot) to add a story telling element to the session.  Anyone who played in Don's game at Dreamation will know what I mean.  At the start of each scene a card is drawn radomly and revealed to the players.  The scene is then framed around/influenced by an interpretation of the card.<br/><br/>I'm also on the fence with the 18+ label.  The Book of Dooms features a lot of nudity.  I wouldn't think anything of it if it weren't for what happened last year:  <br/><br/>A father and his son sat down at my game.  The son was 14-years-old.  Since I was using the cards, I asked the father if it was okay for his son to play.  I could easily run the game without the card mechanic.  <br/><br/>He said, "Nudity is fine as long as it's not male nudity."<br/><br/>I was floored.  There happens to be male nudity on a few of the cards, but I dealt them out anyway.  I just didn't know how to react to a man protecting his 14-year-old son from picturs of penises.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Any suggestions are appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123461/#Comment_123461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:09:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:09PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some of this post needs to go over to Knife Fight! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123462/#Comment_123462" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:10:50+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            His son might have turned gay!

I'd just use the 18+ as a maturity filter anyway.<br/><br/>Here's a less specific version...<br/><br/>You've found a portal to the Otherworld hidden close to your little village - and it goes both ways.  You need help!  But who will you call on - The Cult?  The Inquisitors?  Local warriors?  Each choice invites as much trouble as it solves!

I don't think they will confuse readers too much. You can pick up a lot through the context.<br/><br/>I do have to ask though: Is the portal itself really malevolent? Or is it what lurks in the Otherworld that is malevolent?<br/><br/>Based on the description, it seems that the scenario is going to be about deciding whether to call on the priestesses, the inquisitors or the warriors for help. Is that what you intended?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123469/#Comment_123469" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:23:43+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason - I haven't had a problem with teens playing.  In the case of last year, that 14-year-old was pretty cool to have in the game.   But I guess it's better safe than sorry.  I'll keep the 18+ for this year.<br/><br/>Thor - This particular portal is malevolent while what's on the other side isn't necessarily so.  And yes - the scenario is all about deciding which path to take and following through.
