I mentioned that in one of the books \u2014 <i>Casca: Panzer Soldier</i>, to be precise \u2014 our hero kills Hitler.<br/><br/>Yes, you read that correctly.<br/><br/>Anyway, it got me thinking about historical personages and how we do (or don't) incorporate them into our games.  For example: would you really put Hitler into your scenario?  Would you make it so that the player characters could kill him?  Or help him?  Or would the progress of history be immutable, such that he heads off to his ultimate fate regardless of how the PCs interact with him?<br/><br/>Maybe Hitler's an extreme example and we'd be better off working with someone a little less hot-button, like Winston Churchill or a young Francisco Franco.  In any of these cases there is an established history to these figures. Maybe players would like messing with that established history.  Would that be the sort of thing you'd encourage?  Would discouraging it render the inclusion of that person a waste of time?  I guess it has to do with whether the presence of the figure is meant to be a significant part of the game or just a touch of historical flavor.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where I come down on my own questions.  On the one hand, a game where the players get a chance to kill Hitler is one that's likely to be well-remembered.  On the other hand, it might just be a little too goofy for someone like me, with an historian's training and an attendant attachment to the Way Things Were.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249308/#Comment_249308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-01T08:44:14+00:00" title="January  1, 2010  8:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am of the opinion that you should readily mess with What Will Happen, and for that matter, what has already happened is up for grabs, too!

I think it is really fun to accept that things will change. I ran a long campaign that started in 1913 and all kinds of crazy ahistorical things happened, and famous people did surprising things, and it was very fun. Part of the fun, I think, was pimping people like Jim Thorpe and John Pershing into weird situations, and rocking out with some revisionist fantasy for guys like Ota Benga to make them awesome. This was a game where the active premise was that the player characters were world-changing heroes.<br/><br/>Contrast this with Grey Ranks, where destiny can't be avoided or postponed. Shit is going down and you can't stop it, or even influence it much. A very different, but equally valid, tone. One thing worth noting, though, is that even with the heavy framework of predestination, players are still carving out their own stories and making the delimited world their own. In one game somebody assassinated Oskar Dirlewanger and I thought "well, that didn't happen in real life, but it makes no difference, it was a cool goal and great scene."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249310/#Comment_249310" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-01T09:20:34+00:00" title="January  1, 2010  9:20AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My oft-run <b><i>Spirit of the Century</i></b> adventure <b>"Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars"</b> has evolved so that the players may meet Dolph Schicklgruber if they are captured and brought aboard Air-Baron Zevo's flying aircraft carrier-zeppelin the Zevodrome; he is one of Zevo's Futurian henchmen.

I don't set these personages up as targets. If I did set them up to be a target, then naturally I have to be willing to see them die, and deal with the fallout that entails. I'd make sure the players were on board with this too. If I put Hitler into an adventure, then yeah, if someone manages to cap him, well, there it is. I'd just treat it as a "What if?" and alt-history.
