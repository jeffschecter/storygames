However, 3 of those are in a state of "can't reliably make it every week", so I'd like to add another 1-2. Monday nights, 7pm in Mountain View. Starting tomorrow. If you'd like to give the game a try, but can't necessarily commit to something vaguely-regular, that's okay too--this week is one where all three of the abovementioned won't be making it, and IAWA seems relatively amenable to having players pop in and out on a session-by-session basis.<br/><br/>Anyone in?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130084/#Comment_130084" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T20:40:04+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  8:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, dang.
