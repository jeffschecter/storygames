Obviously I don't think everyone makes the same connection, but the important thing is, I didn't know what the game was about and I wasn't interested in something like that.<br/>When I read the pdf it was easy to imagine what kind of games I would play however. Everyone makes their own band! You do publicity stunts and weird shit in order to become famous! I can totally see myself biting off the heads of chickens on stage.<br/>I think that's what you got to zero in: What do the player do? What's great about the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244224/#Comment_244224" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T08:24:19+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  8:24AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander,<br/><br/>Ah, gotcha.<br/><br/>The book is \xa312, which is about $20.  It's a 74 page B&amp;W interior with colour cover.<br/><br/>There isn't a package deal as such.  I'm the kind of guy whop doesn't think that you should have to pay full whack for a PDF if you buy the book though, so if you buy a hardcopy directly from me I will email you a PDF if you ask for one.  Once the book goes to IPR and such, I will have to look at bundles there and see what I can do.<br/><br/>If you want to buy the PDF now, I will give you the \xa36 off as a discount on the printed book if you decide to buy that directly from me later.  The reason I do not advertise that on the site is that I do not know what the postage to the US will be.  I mean, I'm happy to offer people the \xa36 off, but you'll still be paying \xa312 + US postage - \xa36.<br/><br/>If you're in the US and worried about cost, get the book from IPR because shipping will be cheaper.  I have no idea when the book will be available there though, that all depends on the printers.  With any luck, I should have copies here in the UK before Christmas, although I cannot guarantee that (again, it's in the hands of the printers).<br/><br/>Feedback suggests that the game is very friendly to non-gamers.  It was always an aim to make the game easy to play for non-gamers.  At cons, for example, with players who've never played before or seen the book, I have spent 30 mins with players as they create their bands and play the first couple of scenes, then observed and answered questions for the next hour, then sat on my hands for the next hour and said nothing and the game has run completely smoothly.  So much so that I actually left the game I started at Conception in January and went to the bar.  Half an hour later I came back and the player hadn't really noticed that I was gone.  I'd left them a copy of the <a href="http://totl.net/Umlaut/Downloads/cheat%20sheet%20A4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cheat Sheet</a> to refer to and that was all they needed.<br/><br/>Play has a simple structure.  Players each create a Metal Band, then take it in turn to "Rock Out"; setting a scene for their Band, resolving any conflict which occurs and narrating the outcomes.<br/><br/>The basic mechanics are a simple card draw.  Your band's Ego, Hope and Fanbase scores along with the type of scene you're playing will determine how many cards each player draws, and the player with the most black cards wins the conflict at hand (because black cards are more Metal than red ones, right?).  Player with the highest card (regardless of who wins the conflict) get to narrate the outcome, so there are times when you "win" but don't get to describe how, and times when you "lose" but get to decide exactly what happens.<br/><br/>By default, you play for 3 hours and then trigger the endgame.  Once that's over, you'll know your bands' fates and will describe what happens to them in an epilogue.<br/><br/>(Anyone who's played Contenders will be right at home here.  The game started out as a Contenders hack, and while quite different in play and feel, it still shows it's origins fairly clearly.)<br/><br/>I'm happy to answer any other questions anyone might have, but I hope that shows you a bit more of what the game is about.  You can see a sample <a href="http://totl.net/Umlaut/Downloads/umlaut%20preview.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you wantto see what the game looks like.<br/><br/>Thanks, for your input and thanks for your time!<br/><br/>Rich                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
