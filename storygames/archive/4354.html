I don't know why but I'm already thinking and planning for it.  I think this time around I'm going to have a theme: Crime Games.<br/><br/>I recently acquired Dirty Secrets and I'm VERY VERY excited about it.  I'm hoping to get the chance to play it soon and it's DEFINITELY going on the schedule for the February con.<br/><br/>I've read a lot about One Can Have Her and I'm a little dubious about the "ratting" mechanic at the end of the game but none the less the setup excites me and it's single sitting assumption makes it great con material.  I will acquire this and in all likelihood put it on the schedule.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing.  I really like to have a third.  But there aren't any other crime themed games I'm super excited about.  The only two that I know of that come close to fitting in with the other two are Fae Noir or Mob Justice.  I know very little about either.  So here's what I'd like.<br/><br/>a) More information about either Fae Noir or Mob Justice.<br/>b) Links to AP reports of either game.<br/>c) Information on other crime/noir games similar to Dirty Secrets and One Can Have Her.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98377/#Comment_98377" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T23:28:23+00:00" title="September 22, 2007 11:28PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I recently acquired Dirty Secrets and I'm VERY VERY excited about it.

I will add a couple more links here to some game prep I am doing<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4351&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow">My local game</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/578#comment-2955" rel="nofollow">Furnace Game</a><br/><br/>Anyway some more info about Mob Justice and how it works. I'll put this here but it is basically a summary of the free downloadable that Graham pointed you towards.<br/><br/>The game world is modern day America where prohibition never ended and society has become rotten to the core. From the politicians in the white house to the soccer mums and deadbeat dads, everyone is linked to the mobs in one way or another. The mafia stil rule on high as lords of the underworld but everywhere are gangs looking to take a piece of the action: Mexican street gangs, Triads, Yakuza and many more are moving in on the Italians. Slowly they are losing ground as they are pushed further back into their bastion of Chicago and it looks like not even their friends in Washington are willing to help.<br/><br/>So there you have a brief idea of the world. I will give you a quick idea of what the game deals with roleplaying wise. The games main strength lies in the relationships that the characters form with the world around them. These relationships can be with other characters, NPCs or even particular moral codes and beliefs.<br/><br/>This is by using the following parts of the character:<br/><br/><b>Loyalties</b>: People or things the character is loyal to i.e. the boss of his family, his father etc.<br/><br/><b>Codes</b>: Things that define how the character acts in society i.e. I never hit a woman<br/><br/><b>Tells</b>: thinsgs that make him sweat under pressure, mannerisms that make him stand out in a crowd i.e. my family, my brother etc.<br/><br/>Note that under this scheme a given part of the character could be both a loyalty and a tell giving it more weight to the character.<br/><br/>Their are two stats that are important to the game as well<br/><br/><b>Reputation</b>: the publics perception of you<br/><br/><b>Stature</b>: The standing you have within a given organisation<br/><br/>The game uses a poker based mechanic to resolve conflicts so these two stats are rated from ace (low) to king (high). These stats show you how powerful and influential you are in the world and allow you to use story chips, the narrative currency in the game, in different ways. They also provide you with resources and networks you can turn into a criminal empire.<br/><br/>However they are also subject to rapid change. If a character breaks a code or betrays a loyalty, they take \xe2\u20ac\u02dcdamage\xe2\u20ac\u2122 to their reputation or stature. If this hit is not resolved by the end of the session it can be come a permanent reduction, reducing their power, forcing them to scale back their network and providing opportunities for enemies to attack them.<br/><br/>The game also encourages those with high reputation and stature to do more in the game, encouraging them to maintain theses social stats through action and involvement in the story if they want to maintain the power they crave for their characters.<br/><br/>This is what Mob Justice is about, balancing the craving for power and respect with the frailties that all human beings have and ultimately asks the question: How far will you go to get what you want?<br/><br/>Hope that has been helpful, any other questions I will be happy to answer them but I do encourage you to download the free preview as that has more info. than I can fit in a post!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98456/#Comment_98456" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T16:06:41+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  4:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Perfect is a crime game.

Tell me more.  Would you structure the Witch as some sort of crime boss?  Or MacGuffin?  I'm seeing the trees but perhaps not the forest yet.<br/>First off, let me say I haven't had a chance to play the game outside of the samurai setting. A couple of people have played the game outside of the Japanese setting, but as far as know, it's always still been about an assassination. I think switching the Witch out for some kind of McGuffin would work, hypothetically, but it's something I haven't tried yet.<br/><br/>Anyway, the easiest way to handle it would be make the ronin gangster-type hitmen, hired to kill some mob boss. You could then switch out Mt Fuji for some private estate... maybe an island, that would work well, I think. An option that might also be interesting, I think, would be to set the game in some mob-controlled town in the middle of nowhere (like maybe an early Las Vegas?). That might have a bit more of an "open" feel compared with the straight climb up the mountain.<br/><br/>You could set up the game such that the PCs must track down the mob boss, traveling from town to town as they pick up clues. But there's a danger, I think, of the PCs getting sidetracked and wandering around alot. If you were to do this, I would just make it clear before the game that the focus should be on finding the Mob Boss. The Massachusetts crowd (Vincent, Meg, Joshua, Julia, Emily) played a game where they were circus freaks traveling around Eastern Europe. Maybe one of them could chime in and comment on how that worked out...<br/><br/>Another option here, maybe, would be to make the PCs PI's or something, but you might lose the "honor among thieves" angle. I would have to think about how to switch the Witch for a McGuffin. An assassination makes for a very clear end point, and sets up clear "sides".<br/><br/>Off-hand, I think making the game about a group of hitmen hired to kill a mob boss in a early Las Vegas -esque town is cool.<br/><br/>Oh! I almost forgot---I would keep the Zodiacs and and Fate cards the same. *Personally* I would keep the idea of "fate" or "destiny" or "uncanny coincidence" alive in the game. The game doesn't need supernatural elements, but I (personally) think the idea of "fate" is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98943/#Comment_98943" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:25:51+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The best way to improve your crime gaming is not to read more crime games, but to read more crime fiction and nonfiction.</blockquote>\nQuoted for truth.<br/><br/>Personally, when I was starting to design <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, I sat down and read all Raymond Chandler's novels, most of Ross MacDonald's novels, and a couple by Dashiell Hammett.  I also watched <i>The Big Sleep</i>, <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, <i>Chinatown</i>, and <i>Brick</i>.  I'm currently watching <i>Veronica Mars</i>, which is a nifty take on the genre.

If you don't want to jump into an entire novel, I highly recommend <i>Raymond Chandler: Collected Stories </i>.  Lots of nice 20-40 page vignettes.

I'm also going to go out on a limb and suggest you read every damn Dashiell Hammett novel, with the possible exception of <u>The Thin Man</u>.  At least read <u>The Glass Key </u>and <u>Red Harvest</u>, they've both been liberally drawn on in Westerns, Samurai flicks and Noir cinema ever since they were published.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for newer authors, I like Charlie Huston's neo-noir novels.  I got into him because of his "vampire noir" books, but the mainstream crime fiction is pretty good, too.  And Michael Connelly's novel <u>Void Moon</u> is a great noir heist novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99064/#Comment_99064" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T15:14:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  3:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br><br>Sorry for the delay in responding to my own thread.  I don't mind the literary tangent I'm always looking for good material in this genre.  I have read Red Harvest and Maltese Falcon.  I haven't read any Chandler yet but I keep collecting his books fully intending to one of these days.  James Elroy is a modern master.  I saw the film L.A. Confidential and thought, "Jesus, I've got to read more of this guy."  Then I read Black Dahlia which is just about the darkest exploration of obsession I have ever encountered.<br><br/>As for the games I was really hoping to find something actually built for the genre rather than adapting an existing game.  Part of my personal agenda at cons is to showcase the games and how they tackle their subject matter.  I was really hoping to make this con about three games that do noir/crime dramas.  Although if I were to adapt another game Dogs in the Vineyard is high up on my list.  Sometimes when people don't get the pseudo-Mormon context I just say, "It's Red Harvest in Utah" and their eyes light up with instant, "Ah, I get it."<br/><br/>Perfect is an interesting choice.  It certainly fits the crime description but doesn't really fit the hardboiled aspect I was going for.  I will have to think about this.<br/><br/>Thanks for the info on Mob Justice.  Question though: Why the extended alternate history context?  Why not just a straight historical mobster game?  Does the game still work if I ditch the setting?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99070/#Comment_99070" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T15:31:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  3:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I don't mind the literary tangent I'm always looking for good material in this genre.</blockquote>\nRead Ross MacDonald.
