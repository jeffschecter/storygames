Like, if we were to start up our knitting group again, this same topic could come up. It's not about dice or characters, it's about people.<br/>That said, I have a bunch of questions about situations like that and I don't really know where to turn.<br/><br/>The specific issue for this thread is that we're gonna have a new player -- a guy -- in our regular game. That's <i>great</i>, we've been one short for a while, I've encouraged the other players to tell their friends etc.<br/><br/>But I'm scared, at the same time. We usually play at my house. What if he steals something, what if he's sarcastic, what if he's into Game of Thrones, what if he's violent, what if he uses the word "bitch", what if he's racist, what if he thinks I'm a bad DM\u2026<br/>What to do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443680/#Comment_443680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T18:30:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  6:30PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice:<br/><br/>Acknowledging that these fears are in your head is good, but taking them too seriously is not.  Several of them are unlikely to come up, and you should trust yourself and your group to handle them if they do.  I know it's easier said than done to simply shrug and say, "Eh, whatever," but that's what I'd be focusing on if I were you.<br/><br/>Sharing these fears with your group (hopefully in a calm and "no big deal" fashion, rather than a panic) would also be good, so you can distribute the burden of keeping an eye out.  Feeling like the sole guardian is much more anxiety-provoking than being part of a team.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443684/#Comment_443684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T19:15:45+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  7:15PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also probably worth trying to objectively examine some of those.

However, realizing that's coming from someone who has zero social worry I acknowledge that may not work for others.<br/><br/>My top advice to anyone suffering any form of anxiety issue is to seek counseling. It helps. Barring that, confide in a mate (as in friend, not necessarily relationship-wise). Point being to acknowledge the issues yourself and then share the burden with others.<br/><br/>I would also strongly recommend personal reflection on subjectivity (though this might rouse some disagreement). Bottom line of ANY preference or belief is that there is NO reality or objectivity beyond the self. Therefore it doesn't matter who likes what, or dislikes who. To each their own, always. In my experience 90% of people can accept this, and usually operate within it. Hence even if they have an issue with you (or you with them) they'll be able to move beyond or around it. <br/><br/>Finally I'd quote Remember the Titans: "Sometimes you just have to cut a man loose." You can be as healthy as anyone, and as open as possible, and there's still going to be oil to your water out there. Realize that not everyone is going to get along, and if you encounter a conflict without resolution there is zero requirement to continue the association. Just part ways for the betterment of all, no harm, no foul. There's seven BILLION people out there, you can find a replacement.<br/><br/>Good luck, hope it goes well for ya.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443874/#Comment_443874" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T07:02:34+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  7:02AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much as I don't disagree with any of the above advice, I do think it's inaccurate to trivialize the personal cost of making someone else feel bad by uninviting them.
