                    So, the other day over on his livejournal, C. W. Richeson, one of the folks who've reviewed Spirit of the Century started talking about how the RPG.net Gaming Index (a top-level link seen on every page of RPG.net) is a new, emerging avenue for getting your game visible.<br/><br/>He used Spirit of the Century as an example of the Gaming Index "working it".  At the time, SOTC was showing as 4th ranked among over 5000 registered games, and 2nd ranked among over 700 core books.  This blew me away, since I didn't realize we were ranking that well.  <br/><br/>It may be worthwhile to look at his first LJ post before reading further:<br/><br/><a href="http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/1690.html" rel="nofollow">http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/1690.html</a><br/><br/>Now, it's clear that Spirit of the Century's placement is due in part to some embarrassingly positive reviews (3 of them: 5/5, 5/5, 5/4), since those get weighted heaviest of all.  But we've had a number of other positive opinions going in there as well, which doesn't hurt.<br/><br/>Anyway, on the heels of Chris's post, I did a few things to promote awareness of the Gaming Index -- after all, if it's working well for my product, why not put some communal energy into it?  This is what I did:<br/><br/>* I mentioned it on my own Live Journal (linking to the rating page for the game)<br/>* I put it into my RPG.net signature (linking to the rating page for the game)<br/>* And perhaps most of all: I contacted the FateRPG Yahoo! Group and said "hey, this is cool! come rate the game!"<br/><br/>At the time, SOTC had about 11 ratings registered in addition to the 3 reviews.  Today, there are 20 ratings -- so we've nearly doubled the number.  And the end result?<br/><br/>SOTC is now showing as *first* among the core books, and *third* overall.  So my little bit of "Stephen Colbertism" -- mentioning a website to Evil Hat's fanbase and encouraging them to do something with it -- definitely had an effect on the game's position.<br/><br/>Now, as you may have seen in the above LJ post of Mr. Richeson's, Phil Reed had a few things to say about the validity/value of the ratings.  It'd be incomplete of me not to point at Chris's other posts on the matter, where he addresses that question and digs into the thought behind the ratings.  So here's his Gaming Index tag for his LJ posts.  Definitely all worth looking at:<br/><br/><a href="http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/tag/gaming+index" rel="nofollow">http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/tag/gaming+index</a><br/><br/>Regardless, I think that Chris's early point was a strong one.  While the Gaming Index may be a bit of a popularity contest, getting folks in there rating your game may help get you some free advertising.  I'm certainly feeling like a strong presence at RPG.net has kept sales for Spirit of the Century lively, and whether or not you engage in the general discussion there (I usually don't), staying on top of the forum posts about your game is a good way to get your fans to feel invested in your success.  <br/><br/>In that light, I see the Gaming Index as just another facet of the same stone: getting fans invested in your success, and promoting your game for you by offering their opinions.  Don't be afraid to ask them to say something about your game by using this tool.  <br/><br/>I'd love to see more story games (and small press games in general) climb up the ratings charts.  Hell: I'm excited about the prospect of getting unseated by getting a lower rating, or -- ideally -- by a small press game blowing us off the chart.  I'm sure we'll drop, eventually, as more ratings come in -- it's impossible that everyone loves the game enough to rate in in the 8-10 range ... but I think the ride will be fun while it lasts, and with luck, it'll even give our sales an extra boost.<br/><br/>So.  Check it out.<br/><br/>The Gaming Index: <a href="http://index.rpg.net/" rel="nofollow">http://index.rpg.net/</a><br/><br/>Spirit of the Century's Gaming Index Page (Come rate us!): <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=3441" rel="nofollow">http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=3441</a> </div>

                            There are some deserving games in the Top 10, but I know there are people going in there and rating Their Favorite Game a 10 and then giving a bunch of others they don't like (including some already on the Top 10) all 1's, whether they ever played them or not.                         </div>
