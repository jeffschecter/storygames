                    Heya,<br/><br/>So I'm x-posting this from the Forge - but I'm looking for anyone who may be interested in joining me in a playtest of my Game Chef 2006 entry, Countdown. It's a game designed only for play-by-email, so I'm looking for anyone who's willing to commit to, like, 10 minutes a day of writing some emails for this playtest. The blurb:
<blockquote>Countdown is designed solely for play-by-email, built to maximize the formats advantages and minimize its problems. Every game is a race against the clock to stop something horrible from happening. The unique situation and characters for each game are collaboratively created, and play covers 8 hours worth of email-timestamp-indicated sessions. </blockquote>
Anyway, if you have questions, please ask! If you're interested, whisper me or drop me an email at n-dot-d-dot-paoletta-at-gmail-dot-com.<br/><br/>P.S. - Andy, for every time you say that this isn't a good place to recruit playtesters, I will kill you a second time.                </div>
