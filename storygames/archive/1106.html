                    Over on the Forge (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20824.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20824.0</a>), Joshua BishopRoby said<br/>

<br/>
And he's right, my game would work better without a GM.  Since part of it is based on tarot cards (each action corresponds to one of the suits), I was thinking of dividing up the labors so that each player would take turns being the ruler of a suit and having control of that aspect of the world.  So the ruler of the suit of swords would run the jousting tournaments, while the ruler of the suit of cups would set up situations with the local church and run the inhuman monsters.  When your knight is involved in something having to do with the aspect that you are ruler of, then the ruler opposite of you would take over the job.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things that I can nail down in playtest, but I would like to have a better idea of the GM/player split before I try the game out this Thursday (knock on wood).<br/>
<br/>
Will the game be too confusing if everyone at the table is both a GM and a player at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
Ron Edwards topic on the Forge (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.msg216100#msg216100" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.msg216100#msg216100</a>) seems to help separate some of the layers of narritive powers for me already (thank you Ron).  I want the rulers of the aspect to have content authority.  Narrational authority will be up to grab each conflict.  Should plot authority be given with narrational authority or maybe they have to be declared as part of the stakes before hand ("If I win, I unmask the Black Knight and find out who he is" type thing)?  And what about situational authority; should the players have scene framing powers ("That's it, I'm going to challenge the Black Knight") or should the rulers have it ("After a night of dancing and rubbing up with the Baron's household, you find yourself on the road again when an arrow...")?  The first way seems more reactive while the second way gives more power to the rulers.<br/>

(It's ok by the way to say that I'm on the wrong track of thinking)                </div>

                            My game has all the players controlling a hero on the game board, as well as the obstacles and adversaries the heroes encounter (the traditional role of the GM). It's a competitive game, and there are mechanical limits on what the players can or can't do.  I would imagine a more improvisational story-telling game would be a bit harder to control in a competitive atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends if your game is like a <i>game</i> that people are plaing to <i>win</i> in which case you either need a good referee or well defined rules, or if it's less like a game and more like something else (Role-Playing Entertainment? collaborative story-telling?).  Is there a way to win/lose the game?  Does a single player win, or is it a team-win - and if so, what is the obstacle to overcome? (In a game sense, not a story sense - another player, randomness, the clock, etc)<br/>
<br/>

Short answer: No.  In fact, I think you'll be very surprised how well it works.<br><br>Longer answer: you can make this easier with a physical token to designate who's in charge of what.  Does your game design require all ranks of each suit to be in play?  If it doesn't, you can pull out the King of each suit and hand those over to the players, who keep them in front of them.  Then whoever has the King of Hearts is the current GM for Hearts-based stuff.  (Or use the Ace, or whatever.)  You wouldn't even need to call it the "GM for Martial Conflicts" you could just say, "You're the current King of Hearts."  Then, when you get into a conflict that you're the King of, it's a simple matter of trading cards with the player opposite you.<br><br>Follow-up question: how do you have scene framing working now?  Or did you have it fall under the umbrella of GM discretion, and now you need a place for it to go?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I don't think there is a right answer to your questions, but you're definitely on the right track in considering them. Each game can allocate these authorities differently, and making the mechanics text clear so that everyone at the table understands who has which kinds of authority in a given moment will be the key to seeing coherent play. Joshua's idea of a token to track who's doing what is a great one.<br><br>I could easily see you creating a means to allow a player to request a certain kind of scene for their character and then allowing the ruler of that subject matter to have situation authority. Narrational authority could be determined by the resolution mechanics like you mentioned. With no GM, plot authority is likely to be shared by the players, and the request for a type of scene could be an expression of that along with the power to narrate being tied to the ability to introduce new twists or events. I think I'd concentrate plot authority after resolution rather than as part of setting stakes; Ron recently had a compelling discussion at Gen Con about the problems of stakes and counterstakes resulting in zero-sum unfun play, and I'm inclined to agree. Content authority is a little tougher - you mentioned you want the rulers to have it, but do you want players to have the ability to assume director stance during their scenes? <br><br>The game I'm working on (The Committe for the Exploration of Mysteries) is much like the improvisational storytelling game Stuart describes - both competitive and collaborative. There is no GM, and players both get to play their characters and provide opposition for one another. I see the authority breaking down like so:<br/><br/>Content - completely shared, but with rules to constrain how it is done by allowing players to have ownership over particular story elements and having limited veto rights over events that can affect them<br/>Situational - divided between the active character's player and his opposition in a scene (the first defines location and the other defines the hazard to be faced there)<br/>Plot - completely shared, but with incentives to create a cohesive plot (currency is awarded for reusing story elements created by others)<br/>Narrational - divided between the active character's player and his opposition in a scene (the first has control over describing his character's actions and the final resolution of the scene, while the other describes complications along the way)<br/><br/>So that's an example of how one GM-less game divides things up. It sounds like you've got a good sense of where you want your design to go and how to distribute authority. I wish you luck with it.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </br></br></br></br></div>

True.  And I want a little bit of both.  I want the players to compete for goals inside of the game, little mini-type games like jousts and for the love of an attractive noble.  But I would like an over-all atmosphere of "we are all in it together".

The game has designated seating, so the player to the north is always the ruler of pentacles and so on.  I'm thinking of using an opening and closing ritual each game to re-enforce who is in charge of what.<br/><br/>I don't have scene framing now.  It used to be GM discretion before YOU made me rethink things and make things hopefully better.

Good point.  I'm using tarot cards for the game, the minor arcana for resolution and the major arcana for people, things, and relations that exist in the game.  I think using that division, I can split up content authority.  A ruler of a suit has content authority on the court cards of their suit.  Since the rulers change from fief to fief, those cards get recycled.  The players in game can invest in people, things, and relationships in game still.  Those investments represent more general archetypes.  So if I invested in the Lovers in fief A, in fief B I can compete for a lover and if I win I get the investment.  But there is competition in that another player might win my investment.<br/><br/>And I keep on hearing about Ron's stake discussion.  Has anyone written any of it down?

Yeah.  If there are three (as is likely with my first playtest) you combine two of the aspects.  If you have more, the four aspects sit at the cardinal points and the others can sit where ever they'd like.  When the role of aspects change, those who haven't been aspects get to be aspects if they want.  This also applies if you have players that don't want to be aspects (one of my problems with the PTA game that I tried to produce is that I had two players out of five that didn't ever want to frame scenes or have narritive control).                        </div>
