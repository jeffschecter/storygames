Unless they address advanced players (whatever that means). As such, most manuals need that section, chapter, or paragraph telling the reader what this game is about and what a roleplaying game is. The former is ok. Every story game is radically different from the other, so the "what is this game about?" question isn't to be taken for granted. The "what is a roleplaying game" question, on the other hand, tends to produce roughly the same answer, from my experience, so much that it's a paragraph I recently most often skim through.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wish there was a pre-constructed such paragraph that I could copy-paste on the manual instead of muttering the same old blah blah blah changing a word here, a word there, but without substantially changing the information I'm delivering.<br/>Of course there are radical differences between what, say, a Storyteller system game says and a game coming from an understanding of The Forge theory says. Of course in my case I'm referring to the latter, I'm prone to take it for granted. <br/><br/>Wouldn't it be cool to have such a paragraph pre-cooked for you, where you only have to change a bt here and a bit there to adapt to the game you're creating?<br/>..does any such thing already exist, perchance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302921/#Comment_302921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T00:58:43+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 12:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/tabletop-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/tabletop-roleplaying</a><br/><br/>Text is in the public domain.

'what is an RPG' could be thought of as an overview but in practice they don't really serve that function. it's more of a "oh god you bought this book and are going to try and play it without having the critical experience you gained from years of trying and failing to play DnD?" In a sense most rpg books are written to a very specific crowd of people, people who already play rpgs.<br/><br/>In trying and failing to play DnD people have learned the non explicit structures required to play an rpg 'what is an rpg' is an attempt to make these structures understood by a novice. board games avoid this because they rely on explicit structures, many story games do this as well. <br/><br/>I understand the desire for a copypaste 'what is a roleplaying game' section, but so long as a game has an explicit structure there is really no need for one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302939/#Comment_302939" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T06:54:56+00:00" title="December  2, 2010  6:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>the obligatory "Magic is not real" post/disclaimer.</blockquote>\nMust be a holdover from when Tom Hanks fucked up the image of our hobby <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302940/#Comment_302940" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T07:25:49+00:00" title="December  2, 2010  7:25AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I think we're best served by not continuing to insist that roleplaying games are something different and weird.<br/><br/>Instead of telling us what an RPG is, which is actually <i>totally immaterial to playing your game</i> (and may even be misleading if your game does stuff differently than  lot of other RPGs), why don't you tell us what your particular game is about and what players do when they play it?<br/><br/>That, I think, would be progress.<br/><br/>"This is a game about X, in which players do Y..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302941/#Comment_302941" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T07:36:09+00:00" title="December  2, 2010  7:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler &amp; Jonathan: Yes!

This advice is for your own protection. Inexperienced role players are far more likely to misconstrue the motives of their fellow players, interpret attacks on their issues as attacks on themselves, or abandon their fellow players when the going gets too tough. Conversely, an experienced role player can balance on the fine line that FMA asks you to walk between self-analysis and character embodiment. You are\u2014and you are not\u2014your character in FMA; and being flexible enough to flip modes when necessary is a learned skill that few possess intuitively.</blockquote>\nI thought it was both appropriate to the general subject matter of FMA (VERY adult, VERY personal) and a somewhat funny approach to that hackneyed tradition--much of FMA's core design to flip common RPG conventions on their head: character/player divide, the concept of a "character sheet" and "character history", common handling procedures (e.g. "don't touch my dice/character sheet/stuff"), and so forth--my foray into Looney Design.

For example, "At this point, you don't need to roll percentile dice to see if your character gains the information." I mean, why would it even cross their mind that it should? How would it be relevant that they wouldn't? Those players (utterly unfamiliar with RPGs) were concerned that "I was worried I would have to make up a story" and "I will be judged on my acting ability." <br/><br/>So, there's "How to play this game", directed at everybody and those familiar with roleplaying games and, optionally, "How this game differs from other roleplaying games you might have played" to try to mitigate habits brought in from other games, if that's necessary. Another analogy - MS Word went big time for "Word for WordPerfect users" for a while, but that information was separated and distinct from "How to use MS Word."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303145/#Comment_303145" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T16:22:22+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  4:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given the generations of players who have faithfully consumed similar "what is a roleplaying game?" chapters their entire gaming lives, it really should come as no surprise when they react badly to games that don't fit in that chapter.

They have something in common, they're roleplaying games. The bare minimum of "What is a roleplaying game" = same for all of these. A "What is a roleplaying game" text that applies to all of these games is two or three paragraphs that lays down the basics. OK.<br/><br/>"How to play this game" is usually found in a book under "roleplaying advice" or "gamemastering advice" and such, also burried throughtout the text. <br/><br/>The two have often been mixed or poorly structured or explained throughout history, in all kinds of games. <br/><br/>Do you play CoC the same way as Exalted? No. No you really really don't. "How to play this game" =/= for all of the above.<br/><br/>"What is a roleplaying game" in this context is a generalised statement that doesn't, can't and should't always apply to all roleplaying games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This is a bad assumption, or more exactly, a wrong assumption.

I think we could really learn something from say, boardgames here. Boardgames don't have "what is a boardgame" sections or "omg this is a boardgame but it doesn't even have a board!" disclaimers. It just tells you how to play, period. Then there can be no mistake of taking over practices from Monopoly to Carcassone.

I think just having a short intro followed by a several page example of play would be more useful. I know plenty of people prefer AP threads to reviews for determining what they're going to buy, so why not include some AP to show what the game is about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
