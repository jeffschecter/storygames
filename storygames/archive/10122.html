I only played it briefly, but while the high level stuff fired me up to try the game it never came up while we were playing it.<br><br>A lot of gear heavy science fiction games marry the tactical and operational fairly well, where the marshaling of resources to obtain or create more gear creates tactical subplots. I'm sure people could throw up a million examples - a Shadowrun game I played in came to mind where we took over a section of the Barrens as a hard end of a street gang and built out our underground lab. All the gear creation stuff in all of the books went into the game, and we worked hard to get the customers, materials and money we needed to complete our plans.<br><br>It strikes me that that sort of thing is pretty common in D&amp;D as well (Stronghold Builder's guide, magic items, etc.). A lot of campaigns center on a Lord of the Rings style war, and there is generally quite a bit of operational detail involved. In my experience, most of the games of that sort have only sort of grazed the strategic level, often heavily prodded by the GM.<br><br>Spelljammer involved all three levels, although without much support for the strategic level. Operationally you had a lot to take care of to keep your ship in top condition, and the rules supported it fairly well.<br><br>One of the treasures from a early module was an entire uninhabited planet. The strategic things emanating from that became a big deal in the game, which is interesting because I think I sprang exactly from the module the way the designers intended - precisely by having no support. Only the size, fauna and buildings were detailed. There was no mention of how you could populate it, who might want it, or how much you could sell it for. In reverse order those things induced us to keep it, have recurring villains try to seize it, and populate it from our home nations.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224811/#Comment_224811" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T01:22:13+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  1:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thanks for these, there are games mentioned that I would never have thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot having read or played most of the games mentioned (d&amp;d; excepted), do you think these systems include deliberate design methodologies which actively support play accross the three levels or do you think players simply generate these types of gameplay organically, and shoehorn the rules to fit what they want to achieve?<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan Stoughton mentioned Robin Law's view that specific systems for specific levels is the way to go and while this (probably?) produces the the most focused play, do you think that it is possible (or even desirable) to have a single dedicated design to produce a grand narrative from the strategic down to the tactical level?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224812/#Comment_224812" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T01:32:00+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  1:32AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read about the Dogs See-Raise-See conflict resolution being used to collapse all three 'levels' in a Star Wars game.
