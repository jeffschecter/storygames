Two of the guys are in shows (damned actors) and one just moved away, leaving us with a fairly small pool of reliable regulars. So, we have turned to the idea of one-on-one gaming to get our nerd-fix.<br/><br/>I came up with two ideas. The first was a solo game of <i>Vampire: the Requiem</i> in a made-up city of crime and blood called Nova City that was a cross between vampire private eye shows (<i>Angel</i>, <i>Forever Knight</i>), Raymond Chandler novels, and the gorier of Clive Barker's works. I'll detail that in a future post.<br/><br/>The second is called <i>Embark! The Sandpoint Chronicles</i>. At least it is in my head. It's a sandbox-style <i>D&amp;D</i> 4e game, centering around a small coastal town called -- you guessed it -- Sandpoint.<br/><br/>What I did was started by reading <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a>, which is something I recommend to all gamemasters of any stripe and any system. I read about what works and what doesn't in big, open, questy, player-driven, sandbox games. Then, I went to my FLGS.<br/><br/>I originally went to the store looking for a book full of encounter tables to give me a jumping-off point for making my own. Sadly, 4e has done away with the idea of the "random encounter" as something that's part and parcel of the core system. I say "sadly", despite having NEVER used a random encounter table before, because they always gave a really great sense of the ecology of an area, and they would've been damned useful to me -this time-.<br/><br/>I was unable to find such a product, but I did find Paizo Press's <a href="http://paizo.com/store/paizo/gameMastery" rel="nofollow">Gamemastery</a> products, which include a lot of adventure paths, and some really snazzy map sets. So I bought the map set for Adventure Path 1: Rise of the Runelords. This contains the map of Paizo's "Pathfinder Chronicles" world, as well as a variety of smaller maps of towns, cities, and specific dungeon locations. These maps include one which details the town of Sandpoint and another of its immediate environs. Perfect.<br/><br/>I traced the Sandpoint environs map onto a piece of graph paper and set to work dividing it into zones, like Robbins did in West Marches. I then assigned each zone a "target level", sticking between 1 and 10 at this point, and a few sample monsters/enemies for that zone.<br/><br/><i>This continues, but it's too long for here.
