And I wanted Compose a Satire to bring to mind the epic satires of Juvenal and Catullus, and the continual disparagements with the same taunts of Cicero.  Also the gross slanders of Suetonius or Procopius.  Even Caesar was taunted in the street for being the receiver in gay sex.  But Perform a Satire would beat composing one.<br/><br/>Plead a Case is intended for the <i>second</i> health track you get.  Once you've gained four points of Notoriety (and it will happen) someone can launch a case against you with the end result of Exile or even death - i.e. out of the game.  And getting back your social protection other than by pleading a case is very, very difficult.<br/><br/>And yes, you use the same stat to attack someone as for one of the means of persuasion.  While your ability to keep cool under fire (what Roman will admit to feeling fear?) is the same you use to turn an audience.  But I haven't quite got the separation of those two.<br/><br/>Edit: One more skin needed: the Spymaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416071/#Comment_416071" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T07:09:33+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  7:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I look forward to this Roman AW hack, something I already wanted! <br/><br/>I wonder if the oratory moves are too specific? Could you use something like "make a speech" and have satire and legal pleading as some of the effects? Then you could also include inspiring speeches, rabble-rousing, swinging views in the Senate under the move, and probably some other things I can't think of now. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the difference is between oratory and rhetoric. I feel like they are so close they should be a single stat. <br/><br/>I feel that the legionary is very notable in its absence from your classes, too.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416085/#Comment_416085" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T09:19:29+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  9:19AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make a speech would work I think, and I may be going too specific there.<br/><br/>And the difference between Oratory and Rhetoric is that Oratory is almost entirely pre-planned.   If you were up burning the candle from both ends it's Oratory - as it is if you published it in a book.  Not a distinction I'd make in most other settings, but the Romans seemed very fond of pre-planned speeches (and ones with scurrilous accusations at that) and published slanders and I want the mechanics to encourage people to do this.  So calling it out as its own stat, distinct from Rhetoric feels like the way to go.  (I don't want to make it a move based on mere Rhetoric because the game should be politic heavy and I'm trying to spread around the functions).  <br/><br/>The other option is to drop Oratory, and replace it with something more like Libel or Defamation (I'm trying to stick with Latin-root words for the stats - but can't off the top of my head think of the qualities associated that are Latin derived).  Whatever it would be would keep the Shutting Someone Down move.  <br/><br/>The big problem with Legionary is that I already have Imperator (who needs to be there) for the successful general.  And to put it bluntly, Legionaries were plebs - and I'm trying to avoid direct subordinates.  On the other hand there is room for Tribune as about the highest rank someone who started off as a Legionary can rise to (until you find the adoption papers with the ink still wet).  There's also room for Tribune as "Young, ambitious scion".  Actually this fits together nicely - either way they are outsiders (whether through having been adopted or through being young) with their main claim to fame being from the military and who don't have a secure personal powerbase - or even official leadership of their faction.  Hmm... can I fold Tribune of the Plebs into this skin as well, making it the "Ambitious Outsider" skin?  Or am I massively overloading this one poor skin?  I think the latter :-(                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416243/#Comment_416243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T21:15:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  9:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I take it the game is about the upper echelons of Roman society, then?

Tabletop RPGs are shows with only three or four stars.  Which means that they have to be more focussed on a very small cast.  And the Apocalypse World engine in specific is tightly focussed on a theme/genre - in this case politics and the attempt to become First Man in Rome.  Were I writing a much looser Roman Life game I'd use a different engine (probably Fate Core) and with much less tightly focussed skills and approaches.  The game has a working title of First Man In Rome for a reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416320/#Comment_416320" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T16:58:53+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  4:58PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got it.
