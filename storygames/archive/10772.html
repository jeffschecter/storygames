I see it as running a combat, or a puzzle, or whatevs. <br/><br/>Of course, in a game like <i>Baron Munchhausen</i>, naturally the challenges that come up against the players are all about being in character and stuff. But in a game like D&amp;D, or really any game in which the challenges are less relationship-oriented and more concrete/physical/tactical in nature, I'm of the opinion that "roleplaying" is sort of something that happens in the in-between spots in the game, rather than being the central thing itself.<br/><br/>It's like in an action-heavy movie - you might learn things about someone's basic moral code from how they fight, or spare hostages, or whatever, but you don't get much characterization this way. I see film and other media's "characterization" or "character development" as our genre's "roleplaying". <br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>p.s. Ryan, I wanted to say this on your blag but I took it elsewhere as per your entreaty ^_^                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238890/#Comment_238890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T11:28:23+00:00" title="October 23, 2009 11:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of (yet again) introducing a definitional rigor to a discussion, roleplaying doesn't require character embodiment at all. That is "acting."<br/><br/>I also don't think acting is the principle means to "develop character," but you've acknowledged that already ("might learn something about..."). I'd go further, though, and say that action-heavy is moot. Even a simple choice of adverb to modify how I describe my character behaving (i.e. third-person, Pawn Stance) can convey characterization (e.g. "My guy [brusquely | awkwardly | carefully | blindly] pushes past the pleading woman.").<br/><br/>And I think the opinion you express hinges on the presumption (a) that the game's mechanics enable tactics, action, etc and (b) you're sitting down to play, primarily, to engage those mechanics. How many times have we heard the old saw, "We played D&amp;D for six hours and didn't roll ONCE!" as testament to the ability of the "roleplaying" (acting, narration) to progress game play without engaging in the mechanics. Put another way, you seem to form the question such that there's only one reply that doesn't end up begging the question: your response/conclusion.<br/><br/>To my thinking, roleplaying includes:<br/>* acting (Actor Stance)<br/>* character embodiment, though not necessarily character monogamy (Actor or Pawn Stance)<br/>* fulfilling a functional niche in a diegetic group (Pawn Stance or Author Stance)<br/><br/>And note that I don't have Director Stance--I think one drifts from "vanilla" roleplaying when one is in a game in which one spends a lot of time OUT of those three modes of play; it become more like collaborative fiction writing (often combined with resource strategy or an ex-diegetic reward mechanism, e.g. praise and laughter).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238892/#Comment_238892" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T11:41:17+00:00" title="October 23, 2009 11:41AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, David. And I appreciate your introduction of rigor - I was trawling (notice how much that sounds like trolling) for someone else's definitions. <br/><br/>That being said, I am saying that it feels like there are games where "roleplaying" is what the mechanics encourage, and games where "roleplaying" is flavor text. I'm not encouraging avoiding mechanics - I'm declaring that some games provide X only if you avoid Y, or at the expense of Y. <br/><br/>I daresay action-heavy is quite relevant to a variety of media, given this topic: physical conflict arises either in a zero-sum game of action vs. <i>inter</i>action, or it arises to cap or climax the building interaction of characters. The example you gave, of a characterization hinging on your choice of adverb, is tangential to the "action - yes/no relevance?" question: as you said, I already acknowledged that how a character handles violence (to use the term broadly) can give us insight into the character.<br/><br/>Particularly because of the additional layer of interaction, that of players-to-players, really violent or action-packed games have a lot less depth of examination of character than ones with less - if your voice is being used to describe physical activity, it can be burdensome to "layer" witty banter at the same time. In film and books, characters talk all the time when they fight, and we get a fair (if not enormous) amount of insight from such "fight-chat". <br/><br/>I guess what I'm driving at is that the kind of social conflict I'm looking for competes with physical conflict for screen time, and that sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238895/#Comment_238895" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T12:24:49+00:00" title="October 23, 2009 12:24PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2009 12:28PM by David Artman.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I am saying that it feels like there are games where "roleplaying" is what the mechanics encourage, and games where "roleplaying" is flavor text.</blockquote>How about some examples of the former? (I can rattle off scores of examples of the latter.)<br/><br/>More so, try to name some games whose mechanics not just encourage but require acting or embodiment (I, personally, ain't gonna say, "roleplaying" again, herein).<br/><br/>[aside]This is why I prefer LARP to TT, these days: in LARPs, the social pressure to perform--to act in character--or not doesn't require a bit of mechanics. One group that's all about the combat might more-or-less portray themselves, just in a different setting; whereas another group that's into verisimilitude and immersion and embodiment and all that will subtly encourage (and pressure) players to stay in character, act and react in germane manners (often as guided by character traits), use period- or setting-appropriate diction, and even use accents (sibilance for snake people, harsh tones for orcs, Scottish for dwarves,... of course). If the group favor action, the heroic charge wins kudos even if you scream "Yippie Kie Yay, Mother FUCKERS!" in a fantasy game; if the group favors verisimilitude and consistency, then that yell will get you ignored at best or mock/warned at worst.[/aside]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238899/#Comment_238899" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T12:34:43+00:00" title="October 23, 2009 12:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question. I really don't have the chops to talk about games I've played, only games I've read, for the most part. At least, as far as indie games are concerned. From a one-shot of Spirit of the Century, I'd say that game does requires actbodiment by putting forth a personality-heavy, broad-spectrum definition of character traits/skills, and additionally by giving currency to players who wield their traits to some in-game disadvantageous effect ("too brave for his own good", for instance). <br/><br/>I want to say Sorcerer does this as well - at the very least, the bonus dice demand description and flavor and engagement, if not characterization per se. It looks like Hero Wars/Hero Quest does this too, given that IIRC traits are derived from social connections and personal identity. <br/><br/>To some extent, the Questing Beast game I'm in right now does this - not very well, mind you - traits are derived from the character's background and personality and such, and rather than determine efficacy per se, they enable control of the narrative. Things here are actually kind of split - you chuck a pool of d6's, and getting at least one 1 or one 6 means you get to narrate, while a result without 1's or 6's means the Guide narrates. At least one 1 means success, period, while at least one 6 without ANY 1's means failure, but in either case the player still gets to narrate the situation. <br/><br/>I think these cover it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
