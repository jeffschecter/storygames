                    Inspired by the science-fiction thread, this is the thread for the kinds of books that, for whatever arcane reason in the publishing industry, are classified as "Fiction" rather than romance, sci-fi, mystery, etc.  (You get the benefit of the doubt in crossover cases.)<br/>
<br/>
Some obvious choices:<br/>
<br/>
"One Hundred Years of Solitude," by Gabriel Garcia-Marquez<br/>
"Collected Stories," by Jorge Luis Borges<br/>
"Ulysses," by James Joyce (warning: secondary texts recommended; hardcore index: 8)<br/>
"White Noise," by Don DeLillo<br/>
"Wind-Up Bird Chronicle," by Haruyuki Murakami<br/>
"Man and Superman," by George Bernard Shaw (okay, fine, it's a play, not fiction)<br/>
"The Brothers Karamazov," by Fyodor Dostoevsky (warning: crazy Russians; hardcore index: 6)<br/>
"Collected Stories," by Mark Twain                </div>

<b>"Galatea 2.0" and "The Goldbug Variations" by Richard Powers</b><br>I read Galatea 2.0 first which is a wonderful light fun book which include a version of Powers as a character. from that I read Goldbug which may be the best book I have ever read. Like Pynchon but accessable. <br><b>"Gravities Rainbow","V" and "The Crying of Lot 49" by  Thomas Pynchon</b><br>Pynchon is the master of piling deep stuff on cool stuff, but sometimes the books get a little deep. Crying is a wonderful book that reads like I want my adventures to play. Cool characters do absurd things and are tied together by myth and metaphore. I have never finished V, for reasons that I cannot explain it seems to be the best of the books but I have become distracted all three time I have tried to read it.<br><b>"If on a Winters Night a Traveller" by Italo Calvino</b><br>A book about reading, this is a truely modern fairy tale that has wonderful insite into both story and cliffhanger as well as the divergent ways people read. (note- when people read different books we group them into GNS like categories but, because we do not read together it doesn't matter as much)<br><b>"The Name of the Rose" by Umberto Echo</b><br>Again Deep bet accessable.<br><b>"The Instance of the Finger Post" by Ian Pears</b><br>A wonderful tale of the English Civil War( do they just call it the Civil War in England or have we forced them to reffer to their own as the English?)<br>There is also a wonderful book I cannot remember the title of; I believe it is by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Vikram Seth</span> about Mosquitos, Indian gods and drugs. Double Plus Cool. I picked it up for a quarter at a sale on a whim and loaned it out till I lost it.<br>EDIT - The Calcutta Chromosome: A Novel of Fevers, Delirium &amp; Discovery by Amitav Ghosh                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Everytime someone asks me to make a list my brain goes blank. So here's what I can think of off the top of my head: <br/><br/><i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</i> by Michael Chabon -- best book of the new millennia<br/><br/><i>A Passage to India</i> by E.M. Forester<br/><br/><i>Gut Symmetries</i>  by Jeanette Winterson<br/><br/><i>Lord Jim</i> by Joseph Conrad<br/><br/><i>Midnight's Children</i> by Salman Rushdie<br/><br/><i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy<br/><br/><i>The Inheritence of Loss</i> by Kiran Desai<br/><br/><i>Lolita</i> by Vladimir Nabokov<br/><br/><i>Brave New World</i> by Aldous Huxley<br/><br/><i>1984</i> by George Orwell<br/><br/><i>Catch-22</i> by Joseph Heller<br/><br/><i>Heart of Darkness</i> by Joseph Conrad<br/><br/><i>Sons and Lovers</i> by D.H. Lawrence<br/><br/><i>Under the Volcanoe</i> by Malcom Lowery<br/><br/>And that should be enough for the moment. You should also check out like the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century, which is pretty much a must read list.                        </div>

                            Second <i>1984</i>, also Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>. I didn't "enjoy" either of them, as such, but they're books everyone should read because the ideas in them are very, very important.<br/><br/><i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen. A novel of character.<br/><br/><i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> by John Bunyan. For a couple of centuries, if a household had two books this was the second one (the first being the Bible, of course). A very rare early example of a radical Protestant writing a <i>story</i>, in what was, actually, quite a medieval style. He got huge criticism for doing it at the time. Wrote it while imprisoned for preaching while not being a member of the official religious establishment.<br/><br/><i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> by Mark Twain. Enjoyable by non-Americans although also quintessentially American.                        </div>

                            a bunch more: <br/><br/>{edited to say more than just the titles &amp; authors}<br/><br/>Life: a user's manual - by George Perec â€“ each of the 99 or so chapters tells a story framed by a different room in a Parisian apartment building. The writer generated the contents of the rooms, and stories, through lists of elements wrung through a 10x10 magic square, and the resulting vignettes are varied, sometimes prosaic, sometimes enchanting.<br/><br/>Journey to the End of the Night &amp; Death on the Installment Plan - by Louis Ferdinand Celine â€“ one of the most important wellsprings of <br/>modern dark comedy; helped make slang &amp; vernacular language acceptable in serious fiction<br/><br/>The Rings of Saturn by W.G. Sebald â€“ the narrator travels through Sussex and his slow paced musings on history and life are on point and touching. As close as possible to non-fiction as a novel can get.<br/> <br/>the Tunnel &amp; On Heroes and Tombs - by Ernesto Sabato â€“ psychological and existential crises brought on by meeting mysterious women. The longer book (heroes and tombs) also has a weird subplot about an imagined secret society of blind people.<br/><br/>City of Night - by John Rechy â€“ a male hustler travels America as the sexual revolution unfolds<br/><br/>Najda- Andre Breton â€“ â€˜love must be convulsiveâ€¦â€ Breton reacts to chance encounters with a woman and otherwise grabs meaning &amp; mystery from the places and things of ordinary city life<br/><br/>stories- Jose Luis Borges â€“ metafictions and modern myths<br/><br/>Light in August - by William Faulkner â€“ Faulkner in general wrote very very influential experiments in fictional form used to dissect race relations and mortality and other American fixations<br/> <br/>Great Gatsby- by F Scott Fitzgerald â€“ the American dream from several angles<br/><br/>Blow up and other stories &amp; Hopscotch by Julio Cortazar â€“ hopscotch is like a modernist choose-your own adventure; you can string together the sections of the novels in different orders and it still makes sense. The short stories are Borges-esque (from another Argentine writer)<br/><br/>Invisible Cities &amp; baron in the Trees - Italo Calvino â€“ invisible cities is too good to describe briefly; baron in the trees is based on a goofy premise but it totally works as a reflection on the enlightenment and emotion and nature.<br/><br/>Poor Things &amp; Lanark -by Alisdair Gray â€“ the first is gothic-influenced , the second sf influenced, they are both creative plus the author is a skilled illustrator. <br/><br/>Survival in Auschwitz - by Primo Levi â€“ the best fictional or non-fiction account about the holocaust, in my opinion<br/><br/>Under the Volcano- malcolm lowry â€“ the destruction of a life<br/><br/>memoirs of a gnostic dwarf- david madsen â€“ corrupt popes + gnosticism + a dwarf<br/><br/>the debt to pleasure- john Lancaster â€“ very funny and dark cook-book/mystery<br/><br/>unbearable lightness of being- milan kundera â€“ one of the most effective philosophical/personal novels   <br/><br/>sweet days of discipline - fleur jaeggy â€“ subtle novel set in a swiss boarding school<br/><br/>stories â€“ kafka- itâ€™s kafka<br/><br/>dubliners - James Joyce â€“ the place to start in reading joyce<br/><br/>stories &amp; lolita- vladimir nabokov â€“  <br/><br/>history a novel- elsa morante â€“ ordinary lives gets disrupted by the machinery of history: a novel that is effectively cliff notes to the big events of the 20th century<br/><br/>the girls &amp; chaos and night - henry de montherlant â€“ insightful and mordant books by a reactionary Frenchman <br/><br/>tropic of cancer - henry miller â€“ zest for life, less sex-obsessive than the sequels <br/><br/>the balkan trilogy - olivia manning â€“ detail &amp; rich characterization intersect history and diplomacy in an interesting time and place<br/><br/>magic mountain - thomas mann â€“ the big issues of life debated in a tuberculosis asylum<br/><br/>autumn of the patriarch &amp; stories &amp; love in the time of cholera - gabriel garcia marquez â€“ patriarch is the essential dictator novel and love is his easiest to read book and one of his most touching.<br/><br/>tree of man &amp; twyborn affair &amp; riders in the chariot - patrick white â€“ a troubled voyage of discovery + crossdressing/gender identity + race and religious visions and suburban prejudices<br/><br/>tin drum- gunter grass â€“ another one on how history toys with human lives, with great color and eccentric characters<br/><br/>johnny got his gun- dalton trumbo â€“ over the top but useful anti-war blast<br/><br/>nauseau- jean paul Sartre â€“ sartre was a better novelist than philosopher and as a bonus this book includes some philosophy and makes a tree root into something cosmically disturbing<br/><br/>darconville's cat - alexande thereaux â€“ a long, obsessive, brilliant book on academics and eunuchs and unrequited love and revenge and hillbillies and the dutch<br/><br/>far sargossa sea - jean rhys â€“ prequel to jane eyre<br/><br/>edited to add stories by Paul Bowles â€“ sinister tales of westerners abroad and in over their heads <br/><br/>exercises in style- raymond queneau â€“ 50 or 100 totally different ways of writing a few sentences about a dude on a bus- and yes, itâ€™s literature<br/><br/>I'd also recommend the Modern Library: the best 200 novels in english since 1950, edited by Callil and Tobib and any one of numerous guides to 20th century literature by Martin Seymour-Smith                        </div>

<i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i> by Audrey Niffenegger isn't really genre fiction. It's a meditation on love, waiting, and promises. I don't know that I've ever been more emotionally moved by a book .<br/><br/>David Mitchell's <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, may fool you on first glance. It is a series of Russian dolls that opens as you read it. Exquisite.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i> is far superior to <i>If on a winter's night a traveler...</i>.  It's probably my favorite book ever.<br/><br/>Anything by A.S. Byatt is brilliant.  She's forgotten more wisdom about stories than most of us will ever have.<br/><br/>Paul Bowles' <i>The Sheltering Sky</i> would be required reading in high school if it wasn't about blood, sex, and death.  It's along the same lines as Joseph Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, but written by an ex-Beat in Morocco instead of an ex-Pole in Africa. Gorgeous language.<br/><br/>Nadeem Aslam's <i>Maps for Lost Lovers</i> is terrific. He brings to life a British-Pakistani community full of honor killings, communists, and broken hearts.<br/><br/>Milan Kundera's <i>Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i> is a series of delightful vignettes on the same core themes.                        </div>

                            John Le Carre's book <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is a wonderful book. Le Carre originally wrote spy stories, and this has some of the feel of a spy story. It's about pharmaceutical companies exploiting Africa and, like many of his books, it has the ring of truth although it's fiction. It's startlingly beautiful and well-observed. I can't recommend it highly enough.<br/><br/>Also try anything else by Le Carre: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is great.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Ah! Other lists have caught up with me! I'm repeating other people more than I had thought, but what the hey. Huckleberry Finn is a <i>great</i> catch. Onwards:<br/><br/>Brand has a very nice list. I would definitely recommend Kavalier and Clay, and on finishing Lolita, I felt like I had been stomped on. By dinosaur-sized genius.<br/><br/>Working from my bookcases (which isnâ€™t ideal, as I lend out/lose a lot of stuff, and I have a blank mind when it comes to listing <i>anything</i>) I would say<br/><br/>Kurt Vonnegut, <b>Slaughterhouse 5</b>, which edges out Breakfast of Champions partly as I only heard it on audiotape, and donâ€™t have the confidence to authoritatively rate words I never saw on a page.<br/>John Irving, <b>A Prayer for Owen Meany.</b> This may be a sappy choice, but what the hey. Itâ€™s solid, thoughtful, well realised and god damn I cry.<br/>David Mitchell, <b>Cloud Atlas</b> â€“ although I need to seek out his other works as theyâ€™re supposed to be as good or better. Itâ€™s a little bit of a cheat as the book transcends genre by virtue of being vast and containing multitudes. Itâ€™s absolutely great.<br/>Dave Eggers, <b>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</b>. Maybe a bit of an obvious choice your side of the atlantic (I get the feeling heâ€™s pretty ubiquitous in the US lit scene now) but this book made me laugh my merry ass off and got in half a dozen solid gut-punches when I wasnâ€™t looking. <br/>Jonathan Franzen, <b>The Corrections</b>. Bitter and at times bitterly funny.<br/>Milan Kundera, <b>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</b>. I ought to go back and reread this; it blends philosophical musing with narrative in a way that I remember finding spectacular. Itâ€™s extremely well written and carries its heavy moral weight very well.<br/>Norman Mailer, T<b>he Naked and the Dead</b>. War plus.<br/>Charles Dickens, <b>Bleak House</b>. Really astoundingly good book; there are elements of the writing that feel shockingly modern (the alternating sense of narration, frâ€™instance, or the hypnotic opening closing in on Greyâ€™s Inn), lots of angry agitprop, amazing characters and a great story.<br/><br/>edit: Wallace Shawn, <b>Plays</b>. Bit of a cheat, but just reading them as written, they are, they are, goddamit but they are needed.                        </div>

                            Hilarious; everybody's got a favorite Calvino.  Mine is <i>The Baron in the Trees</i>, which is a top five book on my shelf.<br/><br/>A hodge-podge:  <br/><br/>I love Thomas Keneally - <i>The Playmaker </i>and pretty much everything he's written.  Christopher Priest's <i>The Prestige</i> is great.  Pretty much anything by <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/chesnutt.htm" rel="nofollow">Charles W. Chestnutt</a> is great - <a href="http://faculty.berea.edu/browners/chesnutt/Works/Stories/neckliss.html" rel="nofollow">Dave's Neckliss</a> is a good place to start, but know what you are getting into.  Roddy Doyle - <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.</i>  Umberto Eco -<i> Focault's Pendulum. </i><br/><br/>EDIT:  Forgot my favorite book ever, Richard Brautigan's <i>In Watermelon Sugar.</i> </div>

                            You know, I read "If On a Winter's Night a Traveler" and about half of "Invisible Cities."  Calvino just didn't do it for me.  I very much appreciate the conceits of the books--it's like Calvino wrote the books Borges only talked about writing--butthe experience of reading them, eh.  Obviously I'm in the minority though!<br/>
<br/>
"Candide" -- possibly the best book ever.<br/>
"A Confederacy of Dunces", by John Kennedy Toole, I'm surprised no one mentioned it ye<br/>
"The Plague," by Camus.  Wow.                        </div>

                            James - you are not really in the minority. After If on.. I got several others,: T-zero, Barron in the trees and the Invisible Viscount, Invisible cities. I couldn't read any of them. At the time I assumed I wasn't mature enough but I'm old now and I still can't read them. <br><br>I would second Focault's Pendulum but only for the ideas it will give you.                        </br></br></div>

                            Just a few of my favourites (because there are a thousand Great Books you ought to read):<br><br><i><b>The Master and Margarita</b></i> (Mikhail Bulgakov). It's a huge, rollicking story of the Devil in 1930s Moscow and a different take on the crucifixion. Genius.<br/><br/><b><i>The Great Gatsby</i></b> (F. Scott Fitzgerald). It's just about a perfect novel, crystal clear and not a word wasted. Short, too.<br/><br/><b><i>Post Office </i></b>(Charles Bukowski). This is not my favourite Buk novel, but it's his first and in some ways his most essential â€“ and every working  slob needs to read a bit of Buk. The cynical, downbeat voice of the underclass.<br/><br/><i><b>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</b></i> (Alexandr Solzhenitzyn). Speaking of working slobs, I admire the sheer tenacity Shukhov shows in this book. It's kind of inspiring.<br/><br/><b><i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i></b> (Thomas Hardy). Is there a character in literature more tragic than Michael Henchard? Poor bastard!<br/><br/><b><i>The Tin Drum</i></b> (GÃ¼nter Grass). It's still a great and terrible book, even if Grass is a bit out of favour at the moment.<br/><br/><i><b>Great Apes</b></i> (Will Self). This is Swift in the 21st century mashed into Planet of the Apes: a savage satirical take on human society.                        </br></br></div>

                            The Informers, American psycho, Lunar Park - Bret Easton Ellis. These must really be read in order (his other works can be inserted anywere before Lunar Park). The first is an amazing excersize in linked episodic storytelling (that sounds like games to me), the second is a gut wrenching attack on everything that you never held sacred, and the last is just an amazing shattering of the 4th wall as Bret himself becomes the main character in a world of crazed horror. One of the scariest books i've read in a long while.<br/><br/>Cold Skin - Albert Sanchez Pinol. If you like lovecraft stories, but can't really stand his prose (like me) this is the book for you. For somereason this isn't considered horror, or genre and is simply lumped into fiction. So maybe this one counts as a technicallity.<br/><br/>As simple as snow - Gregory Galloway. My new game is pretty much based entirely on this book. A great tale off loss and confusion.<br/><br/>The Cheese Monkeys - Chip Kidd. Essential for anyone who fancies themself a creative professional, artist, student of art, or simply has gone to or is in university.<br/><br/>Amerika - Kafka. He wrote a book about sailing to america and then trying to make his way in the imigrant ghettos of NYC without ever having been on a boat or stepped foot in america, and its a perfect portrait.                        </div>

                            Here's some fiction I've enjoyed recently:<br/><br/><i>A Hazard of New Fortunes</i> by William Dean Howells - Howells's reputation has been on the wane for a while now, but I got as much (or more) pleasure out of this book as I've gotten from its more illustrious contemporaries.  I guess I'd describe it as a pretty standard social novel/comedy of manners.  It isn't quite satire - it's too generous and Howells is too sympathetic to his characters' flaws - but it is pretty sharp in its depiction of the late-19th Century New Yorkers connected by their involvement in a brand new, Atlantic-like literary magazine.  I especially liked the "journalistic" parts of the novel: there's a long sequence at the beginning all about the struggle to find a suitable apartment in NYC that should be interesting to anyone who's had to brave that gauntlet more recently.<br/><br/><i>The Coup</i> by John Updike - I'm not sure if this is even in print anymore, but I found it pretty easily as a used bookstore.  It is a weird one for Updike, about the ups-and-downs of a fictional African dictator.  It suffers a little from the tendency of writers of that era (the 1970s) to drift into a kind of half-assed surrealism/fantasy, but in general it is engaging.<br/><br/><i>Norwood</i> and <i>The Dog of the South</i> by Charles Portis - Portis is best known for writing <i>True Grit</i>, but if you only know that novel from the John Wayne movie, these books might be a real surprise (as they were to me).  They're both comic picaresques featuring a somewhat out-of-it, somewhat immature, low class Southern everyman hero.  They're also both laugh-out-loud funny.  They remind me a little bit of Charles Bukowski's novels.<br/><br/><i>The Wishbones</i> by Tom Perotta - This is my favorite of the "twenty-something dude belatedly coming of age" novels that I've read.  It's pretty funny and touching and all that, but it also has some great scenes about the differences of making art for the public and making it for yourself that has some relevance to story-gaming.<br/><br/><i>Men at Arms</i>  by Evelyn Waugh - Funny and sad and quietly vicious in the way it treats the patriotic British response to WWII and military life in general.  It's weird to watch Waugh skewer all the pretentions surrounding WWII and its acts an an antidote to the nostalgia that nowadays comes with a lot of the writing about this "good war".<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed and would recommend Gore Vidal's <i>Burr</i>, but I don't really have anything to say about it.                        </div>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Davies" rel="nofollow">Robertson Davies</a>. Anything he wrote. He wrote in "trilogies", but the three books of a given trilogy don't usually tell a connected story as such, because a minor character or two in the first book will be the focus in the second book, while the major characters of the first book disappear. All his characters read like real people, though, with real flaws and foibles. <br/><br/>He's kind of sarcastic and superior in the manner of some academics (which is what he was) and this has put me off reading him recently, but he's still a great writer.                        </div>

                            Speaking of trilogies:  the Derby Dugan trilogy (<i>Funny Papers, Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies,</i> and <i>Dugan Underground</i>), outlining an imagined history of a comic-strip character through the artists who drew him from the yellow papers of the Gilded Age through the underground comix of the 60s.  If you liked <i>Cavalier and Klay</i>, this will appeal to you.  The author is Tom de Haven, who also wrote <i>It's Superman!</i>, a really nice novelistic re-telling of the Superman myth.                        </div>

                            I gotta second the recommendation for <i>Invisible Man</i>. And the comments on Calvino, both for and against. IOAWNAT starts off so so amazing and yet by the end I am getting a little tired of what feels increasingly like a game, and less like a beautiful and incomprehensible love story. Emphasis on incomprehensible.<br/><br/>I've bought two extra copies of <i>To The Wedding</i>. by John Berger, so that I can lend them out to people. It's about a young woman who has contracted HIV and her two parents, travelling from different ends of Europe to attend her wedding. Berger is an amazing writer who I first discovered through a book of his non-fiction essays (art history &amp; class politics.)<br/><br/><i>Night Train</i>, by Martin Amis, is one of the most tightly-written novels I've ever read. An existential noir that will fuck you up hard in under two hundred pages.<br/><br/><i>Middlemarch</i>, George Eliot. The impossible difficulty of human communication revealed through an extended personal &amp; class portrait of the English countryside. How can you tell someone what you want when you don't even know what it is?<br/><br/><br/>Better stop now. This is one dangerous thread. Maybe next we should do 'what should I do this weekend?' or maybe just 'read me a bedtime story!'                        </div>

                            Y'know, do comics/graphic novels count?  I guess they do, since I started the thread--they just have to be non-genre stuff.<br/>
<br/>
In which case:<br/>
"Maus," obviously.<br/>
"David Boring," by Daniel Clowes.  This has one of the best evocations of 'mood' that I've ever seen in a work of fiction.  And the title is sort of a misnomer--it's not boring at all.                        </div>

                            I'll be printing this thread.<br><br>Here's a couple not taken so far.<br><br>Painter of Signs, by R.K. Narayan.  Narayan is an Indian novelist, his stories are set in a fictional small Indian town named Malgudi.  They are wonderfully written, tremendously human and he is well worth checking out.  In this one a young painter of signs falls in love with Daisy, a girl who has dedicated her life to spreading government policies on family planning.  It is much better than that sounds.<br/><br/>Broken April, by Ismail Kadare.  Kadare is an Albanian writer and one of the best writers alive today I think, this one is about the Kadun, the law of the blood feud in Albania and is a meditation on the brutalities of that code and on living with mortality.  The protagonist kills a man as part of a feud at the start, and then knows in doing this that after a set period of days has elapsed he will be killed in turn himself to continue the feud.  Brilliant stuff, very powerful.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Candide is incredibly funny.<br/><br/>One I missed, the original novel Dangerous Liaisons, normally published with the French title Les Liaison Dangereuses even when it's in translation.  It's written by Laclos, the prose is sharp, funny and very wicked.  Forget the Glenn Close movie, the original novel is a product of a culture that prized wit and wordplay above all else and it shows.                        </div>

                            To jump in on graphic novels:<br/><br/>Dave McKean's <i>Cages</i> is still arguably the greatest graphic novel ever produced. It's a meditation on love, music, cats, God, art, and life. Partially autobiographic. McKean, who did all the Sandman covers and directed MirrorMask, is a virtuoso in this medium. Not to be missed if you love either fiction or comics.<br/><br/>I'd post other comics recommendations, but most of them are, to one extent or another genre fiction.                        </div>

                            I'll third the nomination of Candide.  Voltaire is awesome.<br/>
No one has mentioned Chuck Palahniuk.  Skip "Fight Club" and go straight to "Invisible Monsters," "Survivor," or especially "Lullabye."  All excelent, twisted stories about identity and family.                        </div>

<b>Shadows of the Wind</b> was a recent release, but a beautiful book which thoroughly defies catagorising, seeming at times to be a tale of magic, demons and/or ghosts, whilst being in fact simply a story about people.<br/><br/>Italo Calvino can drag a bit, but if you want something to pique your slightly science-geeky interests, try <b>Cosmicomics</b>, an endearing look at pop science from a wholly different angle. The story about the dinosaur, and the one about how the big bang happened are both eminently sweet.<br/><br/><b>Beloved</b> by Toni Morrison is a fantastic book, though at times extremely odd and disturbing, which was also made into a fantastic film if you don't want to slog through the many pages (seems unlikely for the people here). For all her talk-show crassness, Oprah Winfrey is an amazing actress once she gets on the big screen.<br/><br/>Oh, and I will always love Woody Allen's <b>Without Feathers</b>, though I don't know how well it fits here. A book of short scenes, perfectly capturing all the genius of Woody when he was fresh and young, meandering between set pieces like the Film Noir Detective exploration of "God is Dead" to the ever so odd Missing Dead Sea Scrolls.                        </div>

                            Comics!<br/><br/>Blankets is very very cool. David Boring is fantastic and on finishing that third issue I felt Clowes had risen to new heights.<br/>The Spiral Cage is a very powerful meditation on disability. EDIT:... which should really  be in the non-fiction thread as it's autobiographical. doh I even met Al at a comics talk on biography in comics. He seemed like an amazing guy.<br/>Concrete: Think Like A Mountain is only genre in the sense that "man trapped in rock body" sounds like supers stuff. But, it's really not. This is an amazing exploration of environmentalism and extremist ecology movements. The quality of information housed in the letters pages to the six issues are such that I'd be tempted to plonk it in the Non-fiction thread.                        </div>

                            Oh, hey, good point on plays, Meg.  <i>Scenes from an Execution</i> by Howard Barker is a powerful and disturbing look at art, patronage, free speech and the nature of embourgeoisment, set in seventeenth-century Italy.  <i>The Laramie Project</i> by Moises Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project is...  well, the most-produced play on college campuses over the last few years and also an HBO movie, but mostly an intriguing step into documentary-style playwriting on a difficult subject.  <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> by Edward Albee is the meanest little play I've ever read, although <i>Oleanna</i> by David Mamet is a close second.                        </div>
