It seemed to work just about the same with 2 PCs as 3.  The 2-player games did seem to have a relatively high number of scenes that were 1 player &amp; GM (MH characters seem to have a tendency to flee from one another, in fear or in tears), so we tried to be pretty aggressive about keeping solo scenes shortish or cutting back and forth between PCs just so one player wouldn't be sitting on their hands for long periods.<br/><br/>There were a fair amount of strings being placed on/given to NPCs, but I sort of assumed that was the way things were meant to work as opposed to an imbalance we were actively addressing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400971/#Comment_400971" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T11:45:27+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 11:45AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I summon <a href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">@Benhimself</a>, who had two players until I showed up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400972/#Comment_400972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T12:10:55+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 12:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two players is great. One neat thing you can do with two players is tailor the experience to them. <br/><br/><i>Do they like melodramatic romance?</i> If so, consider limiting the Skins on display to: Fae, Mortal, Vampire, Witch, Werewolf. Any combination of those is going to create an archetypal messy relationship. (Like, for example, with the Fae and Mortal you probably get a promiscuous dilettante and a "one true love" self-victimizer. What a mess!)<br/><br/><i>Do they like complicated "this town ain't big enough for the two of us" rivalries?</i> If so, consider limiting the Skins on display to: Angel, Chosen, Ghoul, Queen, Vampire, Werewolf. Any combination of those is going to create an epic struggle between violent creatures of different means. (Like, for example, with the Angel and the Queen you probably get a rebel loner who scorns the pack mentality while still recognizing how threatening it is for them.)<br/><br/><i>Do they like buddy stories that are punctuated by terrifying bloodbaths?</i> If so, there's probably a good combination for that. <i>Do they like murder mysteries and neo-noir high school investigatrix?</i> There'll be a good combination for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400974/#Comment_400974" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T12:18:22+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 12:18PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
