To do so I need to know that all of you would be willing to participate in a workshop on roleplaying games, whatever topic you deem interesting. And I need a short CV on each of you, with games and achievements that will convince an official fund-commitee that you are great guys to have over here for the convention. The official language of the convention is English, and it is pan-Nordic, so it is a great venue for you to make contact with Nordic gamesmiths.<br/><br/>I reckon that having you here will knit bonds between us that will have great effect on our mutual interest in developing RPGs as a form.<br/><br/>I am sure this may be done, and would look forward to our enlightened discussions on RPGs. Please contact me on "tomas DOT hvm AT c2i DOT net" and we will work out the details.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
