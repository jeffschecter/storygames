You could throw the cult at them any which way:<br/><br/>A PC's acquaintance or relative is involved in the cult; they either show subtle signs of distress, or na\xefvely attempt to recruit the PC as well. (Remember, you do not need to be able to defend a NPCs train of thought as "rational" or "sensible"; deeds of men and mice rarely are any such thing, even if some players try to hold their own characters to a higher standard.)<br/><br/>The cult stages a highly public display of power to cow the citizens and persuade the mayor to underwrite a declaration or ordnance of some sort.<br/><br/>The cult knows to fear the Guard, and they therefore specifically target any guardsmice who arrive in town publicly; their goal is to suborn one using subtle drugs, so as to send them to spy and sabotage Lockhaven later on as a Manchurian candidate.<br/><br/>The PCs find out that the local authorities have imprisoned a mouse on vague grounds, denying habeas corpus; the guard discovers that the mouse in question is a vigilante, long embroiled in fighting against the cult. Unfortunately nobody else belies them regarding the cult's existence in town.<br/><br/>The cult requires exotic ingredients for their rituals. A merchant complains of robbery committed by zombies nearby. The trail leads to a cavern outside town, but connecting to the town severs. Following the clues further leads to the cult base.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13" title="VALIS13"><img alt="VALIS13" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nHOXUE6FO675U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13">VALIS13</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418337/#Comment_418337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T04:25:43+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  4:25AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blimey Eero!

For all intents and purposes, the Re-Living are perfectly restored and normal. How could this be bad?<br/><br/>The Cult Is Not Bad Hides A Secret: the ritual is not perfectly repeatable; sometimes it works, and the Re-Living are restored to life; sometimes it is less successful. What does the cult do with these failures? Where does the underground army live? What dark vaults do they inhabit? And what if a secret inner circle of the cult decides that the best way to proceed is to ignore the mistakes, dis-inter decently buried Mice, and gift them with unlife to add to this burgeoning army?<br/><br/>The Secret Cult Army Achieves Autonomy: the secret inner circle of the cult discover that the un-living have formed their own secret circle of power and have fewer compunctions about what and whom they raise; and, of course, they have an alarming disdain for the living and a fundamentally alien worldview. A member of the inner circle decides that his move of last resort is to come to the Guardmice for aid before the Secret Cult Army overwhelms the land of the living.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418382/#Comment_418382" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T15:21:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  3:21PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is starting to sound like Mice in the Vineyard. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
