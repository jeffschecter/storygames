I'm a Story Gamer.  I live in Sacramento, California.  Thanks to a combination of two factors, I hardly know any other Story Gamers in town that aren't folks in my immediate play group:<br/><br/>1) Sacramento is a cliquish place.  Sure, on paper it's a diverse city (for those who don't know, it's population diversity is sufficient enough to make it a frequent test market for products), but it's got a cliquish atmosphere.<br/>2) Gaming is often a pretty cliquish activity.<br/><br/>Now, I know there are other Story Games folks out here.  Talysman lives three blocks from my place.  King Turnip lives in Roseville.  Patrick Sweeney of Firefly Games is out here, I want to say Citrus Heights?  (At least, if memory serves.)  I didn't know these people before I came onto Story Games (and Patrick I only met for about five minutes at Conquest Sac, so I can't say that I do know him).<br/><br/>Who else do I not know about?  Seriously, I would love to get together with other Story Gamers and start something cool together.  I see things like NerdNYC, NerdSocal and Story Games Boston, and have total city envy because there's nothing like that here.  Since I'm not planning on moving anytime soon and I'm not a fan of bitching &amp; not acting, that leaves me only one option: doing something about it.  Gaming activism.<br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Is there anything like this already in place?  Sacramento's pretty cliquish, so there easily is and I just don't know about it.  I want to meet up with other folks who want to check out <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em>, <em>My Life with Master</em> (which I've had yet to play), and all those other awesome story/indie/whatever-you-want-to-call-it games.<br/><br/>If there isn't something like this around here, I'm more than willing to do the heavy lifting of setting something up.  If I do, though, I'd like to have an idea of who's around right now and who might be interested in this idea.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
