The more I think how to do it right, the more I make it complex and unplayable. If I keep it very simple, it seems to rely more on players' goodwill and consensus than on mechanics and I miss some of the IAWA-like competitiveness I would like to see in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat games do you think do it right and are robust in supporting player vs player competition?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333722/#Comment_333722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T04:57:23+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  4:57AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1001 Nights by Meg Baker. <br/><br/>Good scene framing, especially in a competative situation, requires incentives to be engaging to other players and for them to be engaged. Otherwise you need to deal with folks breaking competition for the narrative or breaking narrative for unengaging but brutal frames (bang - does your character die from being shot or falling off the roof?). <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333725/#Comment_333725" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T06:01:04+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  6:01AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @wyrnwood<br/>\n<br/>\nI will definitely get it.

If you choose to decide how the scene ends, you don't get to decide how it starts.  This means that even if you try to frame scenes very favorably for yourself, you're giving up other control to do so, and your friends get a chance to retaliate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333843/#Comment_333843" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T08:22:04+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:22AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In 1001 Nights, there is an inner tale, told to the sultan which the characters take turns. Mechanically while telling the tale, and casting other characters within it, the tale teller is trying to get gems (the game's main resource). Players wager a gem by asking a question about the story - which when resolved gives both the asked and the storyteller a chance for the gem. This dual interest in the tale, where the teller must engage the audience and the audience must engage teller leads to balancing out the competative forces that would disrupt the use of scene framing. <br/><br/>In comparison, Fiasco has a great scene framing approach, but it falters if things get too competative - because there is no incentive to not disengage the other player with fictional positioning. Scene framing, as a technique really only works if it offers interesting decisions to others, but sharp competition is most interested in offering no meaningful decisions to an opponent.<br/><br/>As for getting 1001 Nights, <a href="http://www.nightskygames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nightskygames.com/</a> is Meg's page.
