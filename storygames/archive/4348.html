People make up interesting treasure and put it up for bid.  When you join you get a set amount of GP as fake money in your account to bid on stuff with, plus, when you put an item up and it sells, you get that GP. That's still not enough GP in the economy, and we want to encourage creativity, so there's a mechanism whereby you have some Creativity Points you can give to auctions you're browsing but not necessarily bidding on, and the creator of the auction/treasure gets that translated as GP, too. <br/><br/>When you 'buy' something from another user, it goes into your 'treasure trove'. You can either put it up for auction again, or you can leave it there for people to check out when they look at your profile. <br/><br/>It's like a fantasy market for fantasy goods. You get more wealth by creating more cool things to sell, but they have to be 'affordable' at least at first, so treasure of all types ought to emerge from it.<br/><br/>Whaddaya think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98090/#Comment_98090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T08:01:41+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  8:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of creating a marketplace of creativity - the end products being cool things anyone can appropriate for their own games.

Currency flows like this: (Money from an account startup) -&gt; (Buy something little) -&gt; (Oh crap now I need more money) -&gt; (List some awesome stuff) -&gt; (Get cash from sales and creativity points) -&gt; (Still not enough to buy cool stuff) -&gt; (List more items)-&gt; (Get more GP) -&gt; (Buy that Longship you've had your eye on in Kevin's trove - it's a Jacobson original that's been passed around the community). In the meantime, you get your weekly allotment of creativity points to pass out, so you go browse some auctions, even ones you don't want to buy, and give out some points, which translate to GP for the creators. If you haven't spent your CP by week's end, they go away but you get your new allotment. You can't save them up, or spend them on items you are the creator for.<br/><br/>Tricky piece is getting people to auction things for about the right amount of GP - then again, maybe the market will take care of that on its own. I'm not sure I understand the question "Is bidding regulated by the internal economy?" - can you explain?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>Got it.

If there's no real point to accumulating stuff (no endgame), chances are people will just bid on stuff they think is cool. Basically, the gold pieces are going to follow the creativity points. <br/><br/>Also, I may be too ambitious but I'd love for DMG-bay to feature a "Seller's profile" for each of the participants. Which would basically be a parody of basic D&amp;D character info. Maybe this info might even impacts on the game? <br/><br/>GPs: How much you can spend<br/>XPs (formerly creativity points): Allow you to level up<br/>Level: How many items you can create per week<br/>Class: How much cash you start with, what kind of items you can sell, a single special ability<br/>Alignment: How reliable you are as a seller, restrictions on items you can buy/sell<br/><br/>Yeah, probably too complicated but a profile would be cute. Plus it might actually give a frame of reference for an end game.

Of course, if you open it up to the whole community, there's theoretically more gold entering via those accounts, but that seems to encourage 'dummy accounts', which is a whole 'nother can of worms.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>"Treasure" is neat because it has a hierarchy, categories, and scales nicely, but you could totally set this up for other things as well, like situations.</blockquote>\nYeah, harder to economize those, but I see what you're saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98146/#Comment_98146" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T10:26:05+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 10:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            also, I think Martin's ideas about the profile are really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98148/#Comment_98148" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T10:32:35+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 10:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this has the potential to be a huge crossover application, Dave.

It's a closed economy, and there will always be money in it. Don't have enough to buy what you want? Then sell something cool to somebody who does have money. Sold a lot of stuff? Then spend your cash on other people's cool stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems pretty straightforward, really. No need for a secondary currency. You folks need to read your Ricardo (or even Smith). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, of course, assuming that there is no "win" condition. You can't do this with a win condition in, because that'll incentivize metagaming that will cause the economics to go wonky. At the end we'll all compare, sure, and we'll all brag about having the coolest stuff, and/or the most money. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you charge for items sent to auction - a generally good idea - the end result will be is lower and lower prices throught the cycle as money slowly drains from the economy. In fact, this could be a good way to play... play until nobody has money left to bid on anything, and then check for the cool troves. Eventually the game would end when the last object had sold (or no bids came in), and nobody had enough money to post any new items. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98171/#Comment_98171" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T11:38:48+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 11:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could borrow from games like Sega's NFL 2K series.

Minor invisibility effect. Some sentimental value. Highly sought after.</blockquote>\nAnd then when you win the item you get the full history and get to see you've just won the One Ring, find out all about Sauron's involvement and how it came to Isildur and yada yada yada.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99294/#Comment_99294" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T14:14:09+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  2:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I think that there's simply no "in-game" here... the "Gold" we're talking about is equivalent to what your game has called "scrip."<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
