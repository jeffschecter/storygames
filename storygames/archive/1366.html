                    Okay, people seem unable or unwilling to stop conflating two things, so I'm going to be very, very clear.  It probably won't work, but it will let me feel justified when I wash my hands of any obligation to explain <i>again</i>.<br/><br/>Pacing is how much story, conflict, immersion, octopus-wrestling or <i>whatever</i> you pack into a particular unit of time.  If you're going to meet in a tavern, journey through a random encounter, attack the overlord's castle and spend your loot on ale and whores, all in the course of four sessions of four hours each, that's your pacing.  If you're going to do all that same stuff in one four-hour session then you've sped your pacing by a factor of four.  If you're going to do all that same stuff in a one-hour session then you've sped your pacing by <i>another</i> factor of four.<br/><br/>Footprint is what size chunks of time your game is self-contained and complete within.  If you're going to spend four hours doing all of the stuff above, and that's going to be your self-contained unit-o'-game, then your footprint is four hours.  If you're going to spend four hours just chatting in the tavern, and maybe eventually thinking about going outside, and that's going to be your self-contained unit-o'-game, then your footprint is four hours.<br/><br/>Footprint and pacing?  <b>Completely independent</b>.  They have, quite literally, <i>nothing</i> to do with each other, unless you add some other assumptions into your mix.<br/><br/>Here's an assumption:  "I can't have a self-contained unit-o'-gaming unless it tells that whole story, from tavern to dungeon and back to tavern again."  If you make that assumption then, yes, saying that your footprint is one hour will have implications on pacing.<br/><br/>But, of course, that assumption is absolute bunk.  So don't make it.<br/><br/>Are we good now?                </div>

                            Tony, I understand what you're getting at, but I'm still not seeing a definition of 'footprint.'   Is it just synonymous with 'session'?  What is the criteria by which we determine that we're done with a 'self-contained unit-o-game'?                        </div>

                            Levi:  I like that definition, except ... the "put it away" seems to imply that you if you play two twenty minute games of Jungle Speed then your footprint is 40 minutes.  But the footprint is still twenty minutes ... you weren't committed to the second game, you just happened to play two in a row.<br/><br/>I wish I had a good phrase to recommend instead of "put it away," but right now my brain isn't dredging one up.                        </div>

                            Just to riff on the metaphor...<br/><br/>A footprint is the size and shape of a single "step", the smallest *whole* unit of discrete time that it takes to play "a complete session" of a game.  When talking about multiple sessions, you're talking about multiple steps, each leaving its own approximately same-sized footprint behind in the sand.<br/><br/>Footprints can be small (i.e., short) or big (i.e., long), and they can be wide (i.e., permitting little other social activity in concurrence) or narrow (i.e., cohabiting the same length of time with other social activities).<br/><br/>Thus, Jungle Speed, which requires utter concentration and not much social byplay while it's being played, has a short, but quite wide, footprint.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games tend to have longer footprints, but they can run the gamut from narrow (lots of out of character, potentially off-topic chatter) to wide (a strong focus on staying in-character and focused on the details of the game).                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>I'm not sure I buy your wide/narrow distinction here.  At least not as you're illustrating it.  It seems to me that the off-topic chatter and all that is, for some groups/people, part of the activity.  Just like walking around the course is part of golf.  It just wouldn't be as much fun without that extra bit, that extra bit is part of why you do this thing.<br/><br/>I also think that defining a single 'step' as a 'single session' is definitely off.  The payoff in a game of (say) <i>Diplomacy</i> doesn't come for me until the game ends.  I've played a couple of games that were split into two sessions of about four hours each.  The social footrpint of those games wasn't four hours, it was eight hours and two sessions (I think discrete meetings is an important measure in addition to simple time played).<br/><br/>So, a <i>D&amp;D</i> campaign might have a social footprint of 40 hours and 10 meetings.  That's 10 separate sessions, but you're not getting the full payoff of the game unless you play all the way through.  I also think that this applies to indie games like <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.  Sure you can play a one-shot and have a lot of fun, but they really shine when you play an entire season (in PTA) or a series of four or five towns (in Dogs).<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Ok. So I haven't read more than 4 posts into the other thread (cuz it's big and scary), but I guess when Tony says "self-contained unit'o'game," that translates to "reward cycle" for me. Cuz, thats what a reward cycle is - a chunk of complete game. Because otherwise "committment" and "payoff" don't make sense - I mean, you can take any game and say "lets play this for an hour", and then stop. But that's not Tony's talking about, because you don't get any payoff by <i>arbitrarily</i> playing for a chunk of time.<br/><br/>Am I even close?                        </div>

                            Joshua, everyone seems to have been using time (hours, periodicity, etc) as the unit for measuring the commitment of a footprint.  Can you clarify your first statement?<br/><br/>Depending on how a campaign is run, a footprint could very easily be one session.  It is for Mike Holmes' IRC Heroquest game.  Folks are welcome to hop in, play, and hop out when they like.                        </div>

I think it's more of a measure of commitment required than a unit of time.<br/><br/>Which is why, Fred, I think you're off, too.  A footprint is not a session; a multi-session RPG has a bigger 'footprint' than a one-shot RPG.</blockquote>
I don't find what you're saying consistent with Tony's representation, when he's the one pushing the term:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Footprint is what size chunks of time your game is self-contained and complete within. If you're going to spend four hours doing all of the stuff above, and that's going to be your self-contained unit-o'-game, then your footprint is four hours. If you're going to spend four hours just chatting in the tavern, and maybe eventually thinking about going outside, and that's going to be your self-contained unit-o'-game, then your footprint is four hours.</blockquote>
A footprint is, in fact, a session, in that a session is a unit.  A multi-session RPG is a multi-footprint RPG.  As presented.                        </div>

                            First off, Tony, if I'm mangling things, shoot me down before I go too far!  Fred's argument is pretty sound, too, so I may be full of hot air, here.<br/><br/><em>Edit:</em> Tony chimed in, so I'm striking bits that don't belong in the definition, so as to reduce confusion.<br/><br/>From where I sit, 'footprint' is all about how much commitment a potential player is considering when a game is proposed.  The commitment is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">perhaps most easily</span> measured in terms of time, but there's also effort, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">emotional engagement, social context (who you're playing with), and a number of other factors.</span>  It's the thinking that goes on after somebody says, "Let's play Game X."  You think: "Game X takes Y hours, and it takes Z amount of mental energy.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It's kind of intense, so I'd be signing up for Q units of catharsis, and that's not a little.  Plus, I'd get to play with R and S, but T is also interested, and he grates on me...</span>"  Footprint is like the counterweight to Fun when you're trying to balance out whether or not you want to play.  Examples:<br/><br/><strong>Smallish Footprint</strong><br/>"Josh, come play Bang!"<br/>"Well, that game takes like half an hour, and it takes all of my attention.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">There's very little emotional commitment, but it's got a big pay-off if I can pull off a win.  Oh, and it looks like Laura wants to play, and that'd be cool.</span>"<br/><br/><strong>Mediumish Footprint</strong><br/>"Josh, come play Dogs!"<br/>"Okay, that's four hours on the short end, six at most.  It might take two sessions to complete.  However, it's not going to take <em>all</em> of my attention, and I'll be able to socialize and chat in and around the game, too.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">There's a huge buy-in in terms of emotional commitment and caring about my character, but <em>Dogs</em> is pretty reliable in terms of catharsis.  Hm.... but Nicholas wants to play, and that's kinda disturbing.</span>"<br/><br/><strong>Largish Footprint</strong><br/>"Josh, come play an epic TSOY game!"<br/>"Shadow of Yesterday, hm?  Epic, eh?  That's weeks long at the minimum.  But it's way casual, I bet, so there'd be lots of gabbing and stuff.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Depending on how we do characters, I can probably just throw one together and settle into it over time, and keys will make it entertaining and I'll be able to change them as I go, so I'll get bang for my buck.  And Mark and Judson are in, so that sounds like a rockin game.</span>"                        </div>

                            I think footprints the way you're talking about them are operating at two levels.<br/><br/>I think Tony's level is "In the immediate, for the day I have planned ahead, if someone says, hey, we're gonna play X, how much time is that going to take me" (and with my embellishment added in) "and is that all we'll be doing while we do it?"<br/><br/>I think *your* level is "For scheduling and planning purposes, for the next month/season/year of activities in my life, how many days and how much of each day is that going to take me?"<br/><br/>While I totally agree that both are important to the landscape of gaming, they're both trying to address very different things, in terms of the evaluation of time investment.<br/><br/>The former answers the question, "given X hours, <b>is it even possible to do Y</b>".<br/><br/>The latter answers the question, "given the long-term commitment represented by X, <b>can I successfully incorporate this into my schedule</b>?"<br/><br/>IMO.                        </div>

                            To embellish further.  Your Mediumish and Largish examples both have the same Tony-Foot, but different Joshua-Feet.<br/><br/>You can have a session of dogs and a session of TSOY in about the same amount of time.  Same Tony-Footprint.<br/><br/>You can't have a "campaign" of dogs and a "campaign" of TSOY in the same amount of time.  Different Joshua-Footprints.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>A game's footprint is the total amount of time spent from the time you put the game on the table to begin play after saying "Hey, let's play __________!" to the first moment when you can put it away, and noone involved will feel that the game was incomplete.<br/><br/>They can still feel disappointed that there wasn't another game.</blockquote>I like this definition.  In a moment when everyone at the table can walk away with the sense that the game is complete you've hit the end of a footprint.<br/><br/><b>JBR</b>:  You're not mangling, but you're adding in a whole lot of things that, while footprint connects with them, are not part of footprint.  The whole "payoff" thing ... that's an answer to "Why would people feel that the game is incomplete if we stopped after X amount of time?"  You can answer that question by saying "Well, they came in expecting to get a certain catharsis in exchange for their investment energy, and so if they don't get that then they feel that the game is incomplete."<br/><br/>I'm agnostic as to the "Why."  I'm saying "If, for <b>whatever</b> reason, people would feel that the session is incomplete, then you've not yet reached your footprint."<br/><br/><b>Nathan</b>:  It is possible that "reward cycles" is, in fact, the only possible answer to the "Why" question.  I haven't thought about it seriously yet.  But even if there's only one possible answer, that answer is not built into the definition of footprint.  Long-term, that's just a question of semantics.  Short-term, it's a question of being able to tell you with precision "I know X, I know not-Y, but I do not know either Z or not-Z," which is important to me (if not to anyone else).<br/><br/><b>Fred</b>:  A multi-session game may be a multi-footprint game.  People may say "Okay!  That was cool, whether we play another session or not."<br/><br/>A multi-session game may also be one big, long footprint.  People may (and I think commonly <b>do</b>) say "Okay!  That was cool, as long as we're playing again next week so I can find out what happens to my clone-sister.  But if we aren't playing again then I'm unsatisfied."                        </div>

                            Thanks for the clarification, Tony.  I'll excise the emotional commitment / catharsis / social context out of the definition in my head.  We're talking about time and satisfaction only.  Yes?<br/><br/>I have one "yeah, but" and it riffs off of this:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><b>Fred</b>:  A multi-session game may be a multi-footprint game.  People may say "Okay!

This is what I was trying to get at by contrasting Dogs and TSOY in my examples.  If enjoyment of the right-here-right-now game is contingent on play continuing into another session at some later date, you're in "Largish Footprint" territory.  If you can end this session and be satisfied whether or not play continues later, that's in Smallish to Mediumish Footprint territory.                        </div>

                            JBR:  Sounds good.  Fair warning:  All the words like "satisfaction" and "completion" are ringing subtly wrong in my head.  There's a state that the game can be in that means "Yeah, if we never visit this again that's not any sort of travesty of justice and art."  Neither "completion" nor "satisfaction" nor (really) any word that I can figure out quite encapsulates that.  For the moment I'm left with approximations, and a deep frustration that the best I can muster is "I know it when I see it," which is an argument that I find unsatisfying.  Or maybe incomplete. :-)<br/><br/>Fred:  I definitely think there's some connection there, but it's not absolute.  Sometimes cliff-hangers are a legitimate place to end a story forever.  Sometimes resolution means that you have to continue.  Rarely, I totally agree, but sometimes.<br/><br/>I'm honestly not just trying to be contrary.  It's a big field, and there are lots of strange possibilities.  I <i>like</i> the edge conditions ... they point to different ways of thinking about things.  For instance, IMO, <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> is a complete movie.  I'd watch it, over and over again, even if the other two movies had never been made ... indeed, even if the other two <b>books</b> had never made.  What on earth does it mean that I can look at a movie which ends with as gigantic a set of cliff-hangers as Fellowship and say to myself "Yeah.  It's okay if that's all I ever learn about those people"?                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I've been mulling over the idea of investment this morning.  Could footprint have something to do with how much effort/energy/whatever that you invest during play and when that pays off?  In a lot of longer-form roleplaying I've done, I invest energy and emotional whatever into characters expecting that to pay off in a later session.  In a game of <i>Settlers</i> I expect to know the status of all my investments by the end of the session.<br/><br/>Maybe I lose, maybe I win, but I <i>know</i> where all that investment went.  I can account for it, and say, 'Okay, we're done.'<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>
