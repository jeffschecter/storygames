                    I've never been very keen on 'licensed' games (official or unofficial), and recently I've been put to the test on it. In the last few weeks/months I've been invited to play CoC, Dr Who and Serenity; also, Lankhmar was suggested for Burning Wheel. My reaction in each case has been 'Meh.' In the past I've also tried Star Wars and Star Trek and they too fell flat.<br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of enthusiasm on RPG.net and other forums for this sort of thing. Am I just curmudgeonly or is there a deeper structural reason for my lack of enthusiasm? What are other people's reactions? I know of the 'underbelly' technique, by the way, and that doesn't do it for me either.<br/>
<br/>
It could be suggested that it's a matter of 'other people's settings', but I played happily in Glorantha for years and I still would be happy to play in that setting. My off-the-cuff diagnosis is that Glorantha is a setting designed from the ground up for gaming, while eg Star Wars is not. I wouldn't mind probing more deeply into this.                </div>

I have the same reaction.  I think that part of the problem (historically speaking) is that licensed material cleaves very close to 'surface' of the license (the Color, if you will), while the mechanics and the themes of the settings are never really explored in any depth.  One of the few exceptions was the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> game, which was brilliantly done and evoked the <i>spirit</i> of the movies.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the games often have some fantasy-heartbreaker house system backend.  I mean, what about Unisystem screams <i>Buffy</i>?  What about the Icon System screams <i>Lord of the Rings</i>?  Nothing, really.  Hell, you can't even model the characters in LotR correctly in the RPG that bears its title.<br/><br/>I've heard good things about the original Dr. Who game - I don't know much about it, though.

It's true that you can 'hear the dice rolling' in the background of some settings.  I was forced to sit through <i>Alien v. Predator</i> the other week, and that setting definitely has gaming potential.  Same with <i>Chronicles of Riddick</i>.  I don't think that means the other settings aren't gameable - I just think that you have to approach them from a very non-standard systemic POV, which may not sell well with 'the masses'.  I've suggested a couple of times that <i>Dogs</i> is perfect for <i>Firefly</i>, for example.                        </div>

Are you a fan of either one?<br/><br/>I'd play a <i>Firefly</i> game with Twilight:2000 if that's what it took.<br/><br/>If you are a fan, ask yourself this: Do you think that the games won't live up to expectation?  Is it the group or the game?                        </div>

<code>Are you a fan of either one?</code><br/>Not really. I can take or leave either one. I <i>am</i>, however, a big fan of Fritz Leiber, and the thought of playing in Lankhmar gave me the same reaction. That's actually when I began to consider this as some sort of problem.<br/><br/>It's a problem because it cuts down even further my range of options, and I can't seem to make anybody understand--thus, hurt feelings etc. I'm starting to wonder if there's anybody even here who will get it.<br/><br/>Andy, I understand quite well why pitching a game of this sort has significant advantages. The guys I play with were all salivating at the thought of the Serenity game. I was just... meh. I can't see the <i>point</i>.<br/><br/>I'm off to play <i>Dogs</i> tonight. I am filled with anticipation. But if Vincent himself was running a Lankhmar game, I doubt I would be interested.                        </div>

                            I also don't get the thrill of playing in a licensed setting but given how well they sell, I'm obviously in a minority.<br/>

I'm all about playing in a setting that is inspired by literature, a movie, etc.<br/>

But playing in a setting firmly based in a book's setting...I get a case of the meh's.                        </div>

                            I rather like using settings from TV programmes. I ran a crossover LARP recently based on All Creatures Great And Small and An American Werewolf In London. It went well and the setting worked very well. I'm doing a Terry Pratchett LARP later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's immensely important not to be precious with the setting, though. Some groups, when using these sort of settings, are so restrictive that they it makes it hard to tell stories. You need to take risks with the setting: to twist it and throw it in new directions.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I played very briefly in a play-by-post Dr Who game. It was awful. The players spent a lot of effort being the characters (as they were portrayed on the TV) and none creating adversity or new characters. Terrible.<br/>

                            The important thing, when doing a game based on a TV or movie, is not to take characters and situations directly out of the source material.<br/>
<br/>
If you're playing Dr. Who, then the Doctor and any companions you care to name shouldn't be PC's.  We know, for example, that there are at least three renegade timelords, at the time of the sixth doctor (Dr. Who, The Master, and The Rani) though the eighth doctor maintains he is the last of his race.  Why not a fourth?  Timelords are also known to travel together (Key to Time series) so why not three?<br/>

That's the key, really.                        </div>

I'm not sure how to put it into words.  I like collaborative setting design, making the setting together or at the very least adding to it together and licensed settings often feel more like a straight-jacket to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how else to put it.<br/>

                            I like the idea of a 'serial numbers filed off' setting, since the characters don't have to compete with stuff that someone else has already done.<br/>
<br/>
Like Star Wars: there's just no point for me in playing during the time of the (worthwhile) movies. If I were to play, it'd have to be some other era, which is pretty much the same thing as playing an 'inspired by' game anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Firefly, at least prior to the events in Serenity, has a lot of room available for heroes, since the stories in the series aren't really all encompassing. But eventually I'd be like, crap, I'm gonna run into Mal, and he's cooler than my guy.                        </div>

I think you try to emulate the themes of the story. <br/><br/>For example, many Buffy episodes are about the issues people face growing up, but transposed into a demon-infested universe. So you could so something about that.

<p>Graham is 100% on.</p>
<p>The problem with licensed games is that often they concentrate too much on the details of the setting's technical or census data as opposed to telling you how to get the same feeling and themes out of the setting that the original media did.</p>
<p>With that said, there was a very interesting discussion at I-CON I was in where it was stated that licensed games sell well because they cross-over to avid fans of the original media who want that data. The original Star Wars game, as well as the Guardians of Order anime guides were both mentioned, and the proof bears out - if your gaming material is the only place hard-core fans can find out how big the Millenium Falcon really is, then you'll sell plenty to non-gamers.</p>
<p>But, honestly, that's fucking lame.</p>

                            I'm not opposed to licensed games, I like them.  I just don't think there are very many good ones out there.  <br/>
<br/>
Buffy is one of the good ones, IMHO, and I've spent a fair amount of time playing it and even ran a game once.  There are actually several features of the RPG that make it well-suited for the Buffy material, most notably the Drama Point mechanic.  <br/>
<br/>
What I was trying to do when I ran it was to explore some of the themes and dynamics of the Buffy TV show in a different setting, with different characters, to see what came of it.  Basically, the setting was the Rust Belt, Gary Indiana, and the characters were (mostly) street kids and orphans, and the Watcher figure, instead of an idealized father figure, was an unreliable drunk who'd been fired for sleeping with his previous protege.  There were never any characters or events from the Buffy canon, because I wanted to avoid any fannish obsession over accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
I see that as exploring a given, very narrow genre, not as trying to bring the TV show back to life.  Sure, I could have tried to do the same thing by generically trying to start up a game about a bunch of misfit kids who fight monsters while struggling with their issues -- but it's a lot quicker to just use the B-word.                        </div>

                            A few various things: <br/><br/>I have a fair number of friends (most of whom are not in the same RP scene as I am, and whom I only know because of other RL things) who play in liscenced games (Buffy and Star Wars being popular) who get around the whole "what about the stars" issue by playing the stars. If you play Buffy then one of you is Buffy, one is Willow, one is Xander, and so on. At that point the game becomes about getting to be the character you like most, and seems to have a similar attraction to fan-fic (either to celebrate or confront, to shake it up or do it right). <br/><br/>Heck, I know one group that did a whole cycle where they pretty much replaced the Timothy Zahn Starwars novels, with the PCs being the Jedi-Master Luke, Mara Jade, Senatorial Leia and so on because they thought that Zahn did some interesting things with situation but fucked up the story he'd set up. Last I heard from them they were going with what Paka had talked about -- doing the latest trillogy right, with PCs as Qui-Gon and Amidala and such. <br/><br/>As for how/why that is interesting... well I'm going to make some guesses based on things that they've said. The interesting comes partly from the thrill of getting to be a character you've fantasized of being, from the difficulty of doing the character right by the standards of your community, and by the creativity of expressing new situations through a familiar focus. We all know Buffy, right, but what would Buffy do here? Can you be as cool? Will the others at the table accept your choice as showing real insight into the character? <br/><br/>Also, the point about the familiar focus goes in with what Andy said -- if you already know a character you don't have to create, you just have to act. It's worth noting that a lot of these folks don't have the long background in "making this thing that thing" that a lot of RPers I know have. You read Conan books, like Conan, know you can't just play Conan, and so make Fangor the Barbarian to play. As you grow up/get better at that the characters move further away from simple standins and allegory -- but the focus often stays on taking elements of character and situation and reimaging them into something new. These folks, otoh, never really did that -- so when they want to play Conan they just play Conan. At that point their primary mode seems to be more that of the actor than the director/writer that we, the Story Gamers, tend to focus on. These guys author in much the way a method actor does -- by putting their interpretation upon an extant character through the foucs of their own emotional world. They get from it what an actor gets from playing Hamlet. He certainly won't be the first, he won't get to change the play, but he can bring that character out differently than anyone else has. <br/><br/>Now, that said, the majority of "standard RPers" that I know from "the scene" don't really approach liscenced settings like that. They seem to get into the game by being excited about the setting -- not the situation nor the game it will make -- but the sheer neatness of the setting. I know that <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/brandrobins/weblog/86.html" rel="nofollow">I do this sometimes</a>, where part of my geek brain thinks that because I think the setting is just so cool that the game must be just so cool too! Some folks probably even have the skills to make it so, but I don't... and so I've become quite burned out on pre-generated setting in general at this point, and licensed setting doubly so. <br/><br/>(As a note: those who talk about sticking close to the theme of the show without recreating the actual show are showing one such skill. I still might be interested in someday playing <a href="http://randomencounters.blogspot.com/2004/10/save-last-slayer.html" rel="nofollow">Save the Last Slayer</a>. I do see a point in making new situations that mirror other themes.)<br/><br/>Of course, I wonder if, on a Story Games forum, we're going to get a lot of positive responses to this that bring out the reasons why folks like liscenced settings. I mean a lot of folks have tried (and Andy's point is solid) -- but with the Nar/Do it yourself/I'm a designer vibe around here I think we're going to end up missing the point simply because it isn't for most of us. <br/><br/>I mean, I'm not meaning to hash on you guys -- I'm worse than most of you -- but really, it's "Fucking Lame" because it isn't what we want, not because there isn't a point to it.                        </div>

Interesting.  I tend to go the opposite route -- I emulate the setting and to some degree characters, but come up with new themes.  The last two campaigns that I've gamemastered in have been licensed: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and James Bond 007.  I did similar in my mid-nineties Star Trek campaigns.  <br/><br/>The advantage to me of using a licensed setting is precisely that you have the setting determined.  In Buffy, I don't have to explain what vampires or werewolves are or what they look like -- everyone knows that from watching the show.  If I 'm doing a generic modern magic game, I have to explain all that from scratch.  <br/><br/>But I don't want to repeat the themes of the shows.  I want my game to go in directions that make it <i>different</i> than watching the shows.  The game also functions as commentary on the original.   This was especially true of my Star Trek and James Bond 007 games -- they brought new perspectives on the background, creating new themes from the same material.  For example, several times in my Star Trek game, the PCs came upon worlds that the Enterprise had visited years earlier.  (Some of the players referred to this as "cleaning up Kirk's messes".)  My game was more about politics than ethics, and that made for interesting questions.  <br/><br/><b>Clinton R. Nixon</b> wrote:

Well, to my mind, the problem I see is simply repeating the original material rather than adding to it.  So, I can see value in game stats for creatures and characters, as well as timelines, maps, and so forth -- and especially on mechanics or techniques that convey aspects of the background.  On the other hand, simply describing characters and other elements in the show is pointless.  It's wasted space for those who have seen the show, and paper-thin imitation for those who haven't.  <br/><br/>I like methods for getting similar feel -- but generally ignore material on getting the same themes, since it's not a goal I'm interested in.                        </div>

So a good licensed setting gives you a kind of kit, with all the different game elements you want, from which you can pick the bits you want.<br/>
<br/>
Play Buffy, in the Buffyverse, except now she's thirtysomething, with a kid in middle school and a husband who drinks too much.<br/>
<br/>
Play Buffy, angsty highschooler, except instead of battling vampires, she's dealing with an invasion of Deep Old Ones.<br/>
<br/>
Play not Buffy, but Jodie, who's not an outcast, but a popular cheerleader who has to balance vampire slaying with a full social calendar.                        </div>

                            I think so, but then I'm part of the kitbashing game-tinkering subculture.  I think that gives a licensed game a lot more replay value, once the thrill of playing the RPG version of your favorite show wears off.  <br/>

Let's face it: the ultimate reason why the Buffy RPG exists is the same reason that Buffy t-shirts exist: it's product people will buy.  EDEN studios makes money and publicizes Unisystem, Joss Whedon's company makes money and gets free advertising.  True Fact: I never watched Buffy until I played in the game, then I went on to buy the DVD sets of Buffy and the other Whedon shows.                        </div>

I agree.  Is that any different than non-licensed RPGs, though?  I mean, the reason why there's a Warhammer RPG, or an Exalted RPG, or a HeroQuest RPG,  is because it's product people will buy.  <br/><br/>Are there key differences between gaming worlds and non-gaming worlds?  For example, Glorantha was originally created for a boardgame.  Does that make it different than Middle Earth, which was created for the story of The Hobbit?  I think role-playing works tend to be more complex in differences from our own world, because for campaigns players will spend more time learning about the background.  There's considerable overlap, though.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>There is a huge difference between Glorantha and Buffy. Glorantha is the vision of a single man who has worked and sweated and given his guts for it. Buffy is the shill of mass market producers who are trying to use their market position to steal our money that they might bathe in the filthy lucre. <br/><br/>That was sarcasm, btw. Though I'd bet money that something of that sentiment that at least partly informs the differentiation in many minds between "a setting made by one of us" and "a setting made for something else by one of them" (especially if you move away from cult favorites like Buffy and into things like Stargate or whatever doesn't get the geek love but does get the geek dollar).<br/><br/>The only thing I would honestly say is different between some RPG designed world and some licensed games is that the RPG games are developed for games, while the licensed games often get stuck in the uncomfortable gap in writing a sourcebook for fans of the license and in writing a book that works well for playing a game. Of course, you will probably quickly counter that is just a matter of quality and that the best of both types serve equally wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and you'll be right. I just see a slightly better tendency towards coherence in middle tier RPG designed worlds than in middle tier licensed worlds.                        </div>

                            I think I'm with John and DannyK on this issue: if I were interested in a setting that came from other media, it wouldn't be for the themes; it'd be for the cool crap that's in the setting and for the fact that the setting is already fleshed out and detailed.<br/><br/>Having said that, my interest in a given setting depends very much on how "played out" the setting is, within the existing canon. For example, I can't imagine wanting to play a Star Wars or Middle Earth game, because those settings have such strong stories that anything else you could do with them would either be overshadowed by those stories, or would basically undermine the original stories themselves.<br/><br/>I'd contrast this with other settings which have been used as the background for interesting stories, but where the entire fate of the setting doesn't get sewn up in a world-encompassing epic. Lankhmar doesn't begin or end (at least up to the last book in the series, which I haven't gotten round to finishing), it's just this place, y'know? And Fafhrd &amp; the Grey Mouser may be great heroes, yet they aren't colossi standing astride Nehwon--in fact they've got their own masters, sort of.<br/><br/>So I think of it in terms of open vs. closed settings.<br/><br/><i>NausicaÃƒÂ¤ of the Valley of the Wind</i>: awesome setting, but totally closed. There's something big going on that determines the fate of whole world. Once it's resolved, you might be able to piddle around but any new "big thing" undermines the "happily ever after".<br/><br/><i>Macross</i>: You'd think it's closed after watching the first series/movie, but the sequels point to ways that you might be able to reuse the cool stuff.<br/><br/>Elric/Stormbringer: I haven't read the books but given what I know, it sure seems closed. (Nevertheless I think the Chaosium rules set itself is nifty in a stripped-down BRP kind of way.)<br/><br/><i>Star Trek</i>: totally open, especially if you ignore the later series and crappy movies. (I don't expect to get a lot of understanding from people under 30 on this, though.)                        </div>

                            Elliot, <br/><br/>Now that you mention it, I do sometimes run/play in Howard's Hyborean Age. Mostly, I think, because its easy to avoid Conan, adventures in it are set up to be punctuated, periodic, and picaresque, and Howard set it up as a big sketch with lots of room to be filled in with fabulous color based around his personal oeuvre. Really, due to its position historically its become a genre as much as a setting -- and thus something I will exploit for short-run and one-shot games where I want a "genericish" fantasy setting that none-the-less carries a strong set of tones and assumptions.<br/><br/>Though, I don't play with the Mongoose game based on the license. So, once again I've managed to marginalize myself.                        </div>

                            Yes, I suspected as much although  I've near read a single Howard story.<br/><br/>Here's an interesting tangent: Lieber and Harry Fischer developed a Lankhmar game back in the 1930's which was the basis for <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4025" rel="nofollow">the boardgame</a> published by TSR in the 70's.<br/><br/>Lieber was a pioneer of fantasy wargaming/proto-RPGing. He wanted a world that was "open" for play. Glorantha had a similar history.<br/><br/>HÃƒÂ¢rn, although lacking the "other media" incarnations, has an important philosophy behind it: all game modules provide information about the history of their subject up to a specific time (I believe it's 720 in the general reckoning) and no farther. I believe this is a promise on the part of the publisher. Basically, there's an explicit space for expanding the world's history through play, in your unique group.<br/><br/>Edit: more info on the Lankhmar game <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Lankhmar-TSR-unpunched_W0QQitemZ8782559312QQcategoryZ2531QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">here</a>, at least until the listing expires.                        </div>

                            As I understand it, Glorantha was first created as the love-child of a single man, then made into enough of a world to make a board game, and then created through play by a group. Much, btw, like OTE -- which got that weird because of things that folks did and thought up in game. <br/><br/>Which is a different experience than that one had by those who play to discover the world created by those other folks. <br/><br/>Buffy's also a weird one, as Buffy was partly created to tell stories of Buffy, but as it's both a thematic show and a show set in the "our world but with monsters" setting of so much of modern horror (deliberatly in Buffy's case, part of the point was playing with tropes), its much less specific than say... Middle Earth. <br/><br/>Now Middle Earth I can very much see the point in not playing in. Sure you could play rangers in the North, but THE STORIES (Simarlion, Hobbit, Ring) have pretty much been told. The point of the setting is done, and I know why its a problem to play there if you're not doing some kind of Sim agenda.                        </div>

I'm not sure I see that.  Many RPG-designed worlds seem pretty incoherent to me: i.e. the World of Darkness, the Adventure/Aberrant/Trinity universe, Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, Traveller, Deadlands, and so forth.  <br/><br/><b>droog</b> wrote:

As for not existing apart from Buffy -- the setting is used for two television series (Buffy and Angel) as well as a number of novels and comics, such as the futuristic comic "Fray" written by Joss Whedon.  Now, it did indeed start with a film script, but I question the importance of this.  (See below)

Well, but aren't many fictional worlds created in the imagination before they see literary form?  How do you distinguish the ones which were imagined this way?  Is the original intent of the author that important?  From what I hear, Tolkien did imagine Middle Earth as a setting prior to the story of the Hobbit.  But does this make it fundamentally different from Howard's Hyperborea or Le Guin's Earthsea?  I think the original intent isn't as important as how the setting develops over time.                        </div>

                            I'm going to take one of Elliot's points and run with it a bit, with the 'open' v. 'closed'.  I think that one determining factor is the prevalence and relative strength of the narratives and characters that have been detailed within the diegesis.<br/><br/>Star Wars has to live up to the expectations created by the movies.  The Buffyverse was created to showcase Buffy, and more to the point - Buffy is *unique*.  Well, there's Faith, but you get my drift.<br/><br/>Star Trek is more open, firstly because there's no strong central narrative.  Yes, things like the Borg happen, but they're not Earth-shattering (so to speak) events.  And more to the point - the Enterprise is <i>not</i> unique.  Yes, it's special as the Federation flagship, but there's a whole crapload of other ships out there doing the same kind of work - even other Galaxy-class starships.  <br/><br/>Glorantha is playable because there's no strong central narrative, and no central, unique, figures or features to the setting.  Forgotten Realms suffers a bit from Elminsteritis (and the Time of Troubles).  It's also why LotR and Dragonlance are hard to play in - the events of the fiction are so central to the setting that any other play is simply ancillary.                        </div>

Forgotten Realms suffers a bit from Elminsteritis (and the Time of Troubles).</code><br/><br/>I love Glorantha as much as probably anyone -- but I do have to say that there are times when Glorantha suffers from Elminsteritis, even in some of the published plot books. However, you're right that it has nothing as bad as the Time of Troubles. <br/><br/>Eliot, you said:<br/><br/><code>&lt;i&gt;Brand, Jonathan Tweet has partly disclaimed the idea that most of OtE was improvised during play.</code><br/><br/>True, and I didn't think all of it was made up in play. But a good chunk of things happened in reaction to play and to things players did. People in that game were partly exploring the world, but partly creating it. It's still different than those that want to fully explore and not create. <br/><br/>And P.S. I'm not on the wave of genius vs corporate either -- which is why I was being sarcastic earlier. I do have a thing about creator ownership and vision, but that is not inherently the same argument as the liscence vs. non-liscence nor corporate vs. individual. <br/><br/>John, you said: <br/><br/><code>&lt;i&gt; Many RPG-designed worlds seem pretty incoherent to me: i.e. the World of Darkness, the Adventure/Aberrant/Trinity universe, Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, Traveller, Deadlands, and so forth.</code><br/><br/>Heh, true enough. All of those were also developed over time, and mostly by writers, rather than in one go by an individual or through play by a group. I was thinking more along the lines of things like Midnight, Eberron (though its incoherence is growing rapidly), Arcana Evolved, Agone, and so forth.... However, at this point I have a feeling I'm shifting from discussing "liscenced vs orriginal" and into "supplements make a game incoherent vs supplements add posibilities"... so I'll just say I don't think we're really disagreeing in a substantive way and let it drop.                        </div>

                            Elliot, I'm not sure we're reading that paragraph in the same manner:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.jonathantweet.com/gamestaxis.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.jonathantweet.com/gamestaxis.html</a><br/><br/><i>Notes<br/><br/>Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lotÃ¢â‚¬Â: There's an idea in indie RPG circles that almost all of the background in Over the Edge was invented through play. In fact, most of the setting was dreamed up and prepared ahead of time, in the standard world-creation style. A lot of it actually came from Robin D. Laws. A significant amount of material, however, did grow spontaneously out of play, a lot more than is typical for a campaign. In fact, the setting was designed partly to allow just such improvisation. As others have pointed out, I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do much to show GMs how to improvise their own material. This rant is a small step in that direction. </i> </div>

                            Judd, for me there are three key parts:<br/><br/>1) Most of the setting was dreamed up ahead of time.<br/>2) The setting was designed partly to allow just such improvisation.<br/>3) The published setting includes a significant amount of the fruits of the improvisation that occurred in playtesting.<br/><br/>What's most important to me isn't whether the published material was produced "ahead of time" or "in playtesting", but whether it still leaves room for development &amp; improvisation. If OtE doesn't leave room then I'd see it as a closed setting. If it does, then it's an open setting. Obviously, it'd be a bit more open if Tweet minimized the material that came spontaneously from play. And it'd be even more open if Tweet didn't provide any background at all--maybe he'd just slap some hype in the intro about conspiracies and tell people to read some Burroughs, Phillip K. Dick, and <i>Illuminatus!</i>.<br/><br/>In short, for me, the attraction of a pregenerated setting isn't that it tells you exactly how your game is supposed to turn out. Apparently that <i>is</i> what some people have gotten out of such settings in the past--based on what I've heard about <i>Vampire</i> and <i>L5R</i>, and possibly also <i>Deadlands</i> and <i>Freeport</i>. Frankly, I disown all that "metanarrative" stuff. If it can't be disentangled from a setting, then the setting is correspondingly of negative interest to me.<br/><br/>But lack of a "metanarrative" is a quality of "open" settings. If we can agree that pregenerated settings can exist without strong metanarratives, then what is their attraction? Why <i>not</i> just write some stuff about theme &amp; color, and point to a few inspirational sources? I think it's because an "open" setting both contains points of attraction for its audience (the cool crap), and because it provides just enough "grip" for the wheels of creativity...for that audience. And importantly, I think, the audience wants enough pregenerated "hardness" to the setting to support the illusion of reality, which is necessary for many kinds of immersion.<br/><br/>(And on a different point...Brand, even though you labelled it as sarcasm, I completely missed the point of your comparison of Glorantha vs. Buffy. I get it now, though.)                        </div>

Why do you think that sex is so popular in fanfics? It's sure less intimidating than writing erotica about characters you made up yourself and for whose smut-filled existence you are solely responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly with licensed RPG settings - sometimes you don't feel like slogging through making a setting or a character when you know you and your group will emotionally respond, in a postiive way, to an already existing character, setting or plot.  It's nothing more or less than that.                        </div>

(As for why sex is popular in fanfics, I would say that's because sex is popular -- and sex is especially popular in anonymous circumstances.)  <br/><br/>I think that fanfic is more than just an easy or safer way out of creating original material, though.  So, for example, the common trope of homo-erotic Kirk/Spock stories isn't just using Kirk and Spock as stand-ins for original characters.  The stories are a commentary on the original (and a fairly radical one).  Fanfic is very much about reinventing and changing what the material is in people's minds.  It's taking what is normally passive consumed, and actively messing with it to make it your own.                        </div>

There's a downside to that, however - a confinement to the spirit/look-and-feel of the original material.  No, you don't have to create everything from scratch, but you also can't take am existing character and go off in a radical new direction - new and interesting fetishes (wingfic!?) not withstanding.  This also, I think, misses the boat when talking about original settings - cribbing from extant material is a time-honored tradition.  I played an entire campaign as, essentially, the fantasy analog of Jean-Luc Picard.  Not that I told anyone at the table that.
<blockquote>Why do you think that sex is so popular in fanfics? It's sure less intimidating than writing erotica about characters you made up yourself and for whose smut-filled existence you are solely responsible.</blockquote>
It also handily avoids writing analogs of your friends and local-area desirables who might find your filth!                        </div>

<p>I can't stand fanfic. I don't buy (tv/movie) licensed games either! Perhaps there is truth to this.</p>
<p>Confession: After I saw Episode III, I was <em>so totally</em> gonna rush out and buy Star Wars d20 and whatever Episode III sourcebook Wizards had <em>obviously</em> released. I probably wouldn't have ever played it, I was just itching to look new Extended Universe stuff.<br/>
Fortunately for me but strangly for them, Wizards had discontinued support for the SW RPG, favoring the collectible minis line instead.</p>

                            Absolutely you can crib to make original settings, there's no bright line between my Jade Empire fanfic in which none of the original characters appear but the general mythology, geography and history are used, and a generic wuxia fantasy story, and a 14 year old boy's fanfic in which Dawn Star makes it with the Princess. It's a broad spectrum and tastes differ as to where on the spectrum is the best/easiest/most effective place to be.<br/>

                            Hey, Droog, I'm at least 50% on board with your dislike of licensed settings. Where I remain puzzled is why you like Glorantha but dislike the idea of playing in Lankhmar. (I'd toss in Star Trek but if you're not an old TOS fogey like me, then I imagine all the Borg-dominated continuity of TNG might get in the way of enjoyment.)                        </div>

Even though, I must say, I'm not entirely crazy about Glorantha per se, just as I'm not entirely crazy about HÃƒÂ¢rn per se. Just that, since I see both as "open" settings, they seem like reasonable playgrounds for RPGing.                        </div>

In Glorantha they originally bugged me a lot. Later I realized that Glorantha had all kinds of silly stuff and you just have to let it all wash over you and accept it.                        </div>

<code>Hey, Droog, I'm at least 50% on board with your dislike of licensed settings. Where I remain puzzled is why you like Glorantha but dislike the idea of playing in Lankhmar. (I'd toss in Star Trek but if you're not an old TOS fogey like me, then I imagine all the Borg-dominated continuity of TNG might get in the way of enjoyment.)<br/></code><br/>Elliot, I'm not sure myself (which is why I started the thread). I'm open to the possibility that the reason I like Glorantha is simply that I've been using it for so long (I make it about twenty-four years now). Certainly there are no other published worlds I can think of that interest me. In a real sense, Glorantha is mine in a way no other RPG creation is. Perhaps that's why the snippets of fiction about it generally bore me. <br/><br/>Lankhmar--and to take an example even closer to my heart, Earthsea--is inextricably connected in my mind with the work of the author. Earthsea exists for the purpose of telling Le Guin's stories about life and death, men and women. Lankhmar exists for the purpose of telling tall tales about Fafhrd and the Mouser. These worlds have a unique texture made up of the writer's style, ideology and taste. To step outside that feels hollow; like pastiche, hero-worship, imitation.<br/><br/>It goes back to what I said on Joshua BR's thread on fantasy. It's not the form that matters, it's the substance.                        </div>

                            Yeah, but Droog... Lankhmar is, itself, pastiche, hero-worship, and imitation.<br/>
<br/>
Zelazny LOVED the idea that people would play a roleplaying game set in his world.  If he didn't feel like having a thousand clones of Corwin running around in peoples' heads were going to cheapen the character, why should I?                        </div>

                            Well, V., I'm not trying to tell you how you should feel about it. I don't care about Zelazny and Corwin, perhaps because I haven't read those books. Suffice it to say that I don't see Lankhmar (Nehwon) as pastiche or imitation. That goes double-triple for Earthsea.                        </div>

                            "If I have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants."<br/><br/>Originally said by Isaac Newton, oft quoted by creative people ever since.<br/><br/>Imitation isn't a binary condition.  Every creative work ever produced is, to some degree, an imitation of works that came before.  There are only so many plots.  There are only so many character archetypes.  There are only so many emotions.  There are only so many combinations of story elements that will resonate with the human experience.<br/><br/>The fact that you don't see them in that light may just be a matter of never having been exposed to the works from which they're derived; you've never seen behind the curtain.<br/><br/>I see the F&amp;GM books as SEMINAL works from which adventure roleplaying is derived.  If you're playing in Glorantha... as far as I'm concerned, you're playing, to some degree, in an imitation of Lankhmar.                        </div>

<br/>
EDIT: Whoa, I may be wrong about that. The copyrights in the collections often attribute various stories to names other than Lieber, but info I'm getting from elsewhere says he wrote everything except for part of one story ("The Lords of Quarmall," if memory serves). OTOH, Wikipedia reports that Faf &amp; the Mouser were based on Lieber &amp; Fischer, so I'm going to go with that as support for Lieber being a proto-gamer at heart.                        </div>

<code>I think the fact that Lieber accepted a large number of F&amp;GM stories into the canon which he himself didn't write is relevant. That sort of multi-perspective and willingless to let others play with your toys shows a kinship with RPG world-design.<br/></code><br/>As far as I'm aware (and I have all the <i>Swords</i> editions of the stories, published by Granada), that's not quite so. Leiber's friend Harry Otto Fischer wrote a considerable chunk of one story, 'The Lords of Quarmall', but that seems to be the extent of it.<br/><br/>But that's not exactly my point, anyway. I just don't think Nehwon has any life apart from the stories. When I steal from Leiber in the middle of a game, as I have, I steal his wit and humour. What else is there to steal? Set dressing? Nehwon is about a millimetre deep.<br/><br/>I'm not making some sort of moral judgement on people who play in these settings. Please don't get defensive on me, guys (I don't mean you, Elliot).                        </div>

                            Droog--yep, my error. See my retraction above. I don't know about your books, but mine have copyrights and acknowledgments from many different names. Imagine my feelings about the fact that I liked a lot of the non-"Lieber" stories better than the "Lieber" ones.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Nehwon isn't very deep. And personally I'm not eager to run a campaign set in it. Yet it would work for a campaign as long as the players didn't keep meeting F &amp; the GM. Or if F &amp; the GM just didn't exist. I mean, up to the point I've read, they've never done anything that fundamentally altered the world, or conversely, they've never prevented anything that would have made the world unsuitable for other adventurers to kick around in and get themselves killed. Extract the main characters from Middle Earth and you've got a world where either somebody else (most likely the PC's) has to step into their shoes, or the world is going to be changed to the point that it loses its basic attraction.                        </div>

                            Here's an article by M. John Harrison I just remembered that has some bearing on the way I think about this issue:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/show.html?ey,viriconium,1" rel="nofollow">What it might be like to live in Viriconium</a>
<blockquote><i>The great modern fantasies were written out of religious, philosophical and psychological landscapes. They were sermons. They were metaphors. They were rhetoric. They were books, which means that the one thing they actually werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t was countries with people in them.<br/><br/>The commercial fantasy that has replaced them is often based on a mistaken attempt to literalise someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s metaphor, or realise someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rhetorical imagery. For instance, the moment you begin to ask (or rather to answer) questions like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes, but what did Sauron look like?Ã¢â‚¬Â; or, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just how might an Orc regiment organise itself?Ã¢â‚¬Â; the moment you concern yourself with the economic geography of pseudo-feudal societies, with the real way to use swords, with the politics of courts, you have diluted the poetic power of TolkienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s images. You have brought them under control. You have tamed, colonised and put your own cultural mark on them.<br/>...............................................................<br/>What would it be really like to live in the world ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦?Ã¢â‚¬Â is an inappropriate question, a category error. You understand this immediately you ask it of the inscape of, say, Samuel Beckett or Wyndham Lewis. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it asked (and I certainly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it answered) of Viriconium, so I made that world increasingly shifting and complex. You can not learn its rules. More importantly, Viriconium is never the same place twice. That is becauseÃ¢â‚¬â€like Middle-EarthÃ¢â‚¬â€it is not a place. It is an attempt to animate the bill of goods on offer. Those goods, as in Tolkien or Moorcock, Disney or Kafka, Le Guin or Wolfe, are ideological. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ViriconiumÃ¢â‚¬Â is a theory about the power-structures culture is designed to hide; an allegory of language, how it can only fail; the statement of a philosophical (not to say ethological) despair. At the same time it is an unashamed postmodern fiction of the heart, out of which all the values we yearn for most have been swept precisely so that we will try to put them back again (and, in that attempt, look at them afresh).<br/></i></blockquote>
<br/>Come to think of it, it's a lot more than 'some'.                        </div>

                            What I find interesting is that I agree with M. John Harrison's essay to a degree about what it is doing, but I don't see why that's bad.  Yes, writing in a world is taking ownership of the material and putting your personal mark on it.  That's true for adapted works in general.  This colonization happens all the time in collaborative works.  That's true when you direct a play or film based on a script.  The director takes control and puts his mark on the script by the casting, staging, acting, and so forth.   <br/><br/>I think that this colonization is good.  It is exchange of ideas.  For example, John Gardner's <i>Grendel</i> was colonising the world of <i>Beowulf</i>.  Interpretation and adaptation are good things.  <br/><br/>And it is equally true in role-playing games.  By role-playing in a setting, I am putting my cultural mark on that.  Rather than passively consuming the original, I am exploring beyond what it written.                        </div>

                            I guess it comes down to ideology and aesthetics.<br/>

EDIT: And before anybody says 'Duh!', I mean that I think there may be wider issues of approaches to art here. For instance, I generally dislike film adaptations of books, and the more I like the book, the less I like the film. Whereas I've noticed many others looking forward to forthcoming film adaptations, I tend to feel that the best flims are not adaptations.                        </div>

                            Sometimes its nice to go to a restaurant and have a pre-concieved meal brought to you to consume.  Sometimes it's nice to work up a recipie and cook a great meal in your own kitchen.  Sometimes it's fun to do a buffet/dim sum kind of "cobble together a custom meal based on a range of pre-existing meal modules."<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I'm just about always up for soul food, barbecue, or Thai, I'm occasionally in the mood for Greek or Chinese, and I pretty much never ever want to eat Indian if I can help it. <br/>
<br/>
There are some ideas in roleplaying that I feel that I never want to deal with.  I'm not particularly interested in games that are heavy on player vs player conflict.  And I'm not a huge fan of intense exploration-of-deep-character-psychology-within-a-highly specialized-crucible type games, whether they're explicitly or not designed as roleplaying exercises.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to get to that level of exploration of character in a slower fashion, and within a more conventional plot structure.  Which probably makes me kind of old fashioned/simplistic in a post-Forge world, but oh well.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, some of these choices for me break down into a fairly hard "Want to do mostly always/Don't want to do mostly ever" dichotomy, but some, like licensed/adapted setting vs. built-as-a-game setting vs. created by me and my friends from scratch setting, are more a matter of mood, energy level, the personality of the potential players, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm playing in a scratch built world (superhero pastiche), my previous game was Star Wars, the game before that was a game-built world (Exalted), and before that another scratch-built world (pretty hard science fiction), before that another game world, before that a game world heavily modified/added to, etc etc .  It's all good.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure I'd want to place value on creation.  Because it seems like there's a mild implication that creation is superior  to consumption, and I'm dubious about that within a practical "this is a hobby for me, not a career, and the fate of the world doesn't rest on how I approach it" context.  I mean, when I'm reading Dumas (Dickens, Melville, LeGuin, Morrison, whoever), I see no reason to feel guilty that I'm not writing a book instead.  <br/>
<br/>
The hobby can be approached as an act of creation, obviously, in fact I reckon all gaming will have some greater or lesser degree of creation activity within them. But ultimately I'm here to have fun with friends, and I'm not necessarily using how much of the experience we created as a measure of the fun.  While I've had tremendous fun creating worlds and game systems with friends, every meal I enjoy with them doesn't have to be cooked up by me (or us).  <br/>
<br/>
(It's funny how loaded the word "fun" is to me nowadays, when it comes to gaming discussions.  it's all glowy and radioactive in my mind.)                        </div>

As for the former, I feel that adapting a work is still creating something new.  I do value originality, but often, great works come from progressive refinement.  For example, many (if not most) of Shakespeare's works borrow setting and plot from earlier works.  For that matter, there have been plenty of good works adapting Shakespeare.  As far as films go, feature films are inherently collaborative works that are usually thoroughly colonized.  While occaisionally you have writer/director/stars who take a film from beginning to end, most of the time a film passes through many hands.  I'd say about half of my favorite films are adapted from other media, like <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, <i>Bridge on the River Kwai</i>, and <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>.  <br/><br/>As for the word "colonisation" -- well, it's not a term that I would have chosen myself.  I'd prefer "adapting" or perhaps "re-interpreting".                        </div>

                            John, as far as I'm concerned you're still talking past me. It's not really a matter of 'how creative you can be'. It's the 'category error' that Harrison writes about. Read the posts where I'm stumbling towards articulating this.<br/><br/>There are some interesting trends here as to what sort of games people prefer compared to their overall approach to art and life. This thread has helped me work out what it is that irritates me about licensed settings, and maybe some other people too. It's also helped to clarify why I often find myself alone among other roleplayers. I always work best through discussion.                        </div>

                            Personally I don't really see anything wrong with "fanfic role-playing" per se. One of the very best game sessions I've ever been in was a Firefly game at a convention where everyone got into the series characters perfectly. I'm not at all worried about not living up to the series as long as it's fun, which in that case it was in spades. The main reason I'm not all that into licensed RPGs? Even though my friends have similar tastes overall, there are vanishingly few titles that everyone likes enough to want to do an RPG thing with.                        </div>

Keith just pointed out the contradiction of me posting this some years ago and now I'm playing in a Forgotten Realms campaign.  Suck it, Senkowski!

For me, it is about playing in a setting that we are all invested in and while doing so, I get to tinker with ebay-purchasing of old AD&amp;D supplements on the cheap and read old FR supplements with both an eye to be inspired for the campaign and a critical eye thinking about how to convey rich settings through supplements.                        </div>

This makes me think it's a matter of implementation.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised that no one has brought either of them up so far.</blockquote>
Agreed, Bret.  MG, BE and Burning Sands: Jihad are amazing examples of licensed games that work for me.                        </div>

I think neither MG nor BE were published when I started this thread. In fact I now have MG, but not BE. I bought the trade hardback of MG at the same time as the game.<br/><br/>My feeling about MG is that it's a great system, but I'm not particularly excited to play in it. On the other hand, I think that the comics are actually pretty thin, and there's a fair bit of scope for doing something new. However, I'd still rather play BW.                        </div>

No, you are right, it is not a license.  It is an homage or a game inspired by Dune or Dune with the serial numbers filed off.                        </div>

                            I enjoyed mouse guard and would love to play it some more. having encountered it before burning wheel i think it gave me some appreciation for how the mechanics fit the setting and not so much how mechanics were adapted to the setting.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the game we played set in firefly, despite the cortex system, i think that universe is rife with potential for gaming, eastern, western, low/high tech space zombies, psychics, lots of great material to work with.<br/>
<br/>
i would love to take a stab at making a new star wars game, the kind of story telling shown in those movies, everyone acting as if they are pulled along by some kind of fate, as if some large man with a beard and a plaid shirt were controlling them. that is the kind of story telling that should work wonders as a game.                        </div>

                            Fully Disclosure: I've never really gotten the appeal of licensed properties from novels, TV or film either. I'd rather be working from scratch.<br><br>That said, an observation:<br><br>I've noticed a distinction between pre-bought settings that people have referenced -- and have different reactions to.<br/><br/>In one type (Buffy, Star Wars, Firefly) we have a clutch of characters that are the focus of the setting. All the mythology and setting and stuff actually takes a back seat to the social interactions of the characters. (Which is true, by the way, of almost anything we call a story.)<br/><br/>In the other type (Glorantha, Forgotten Realms), what we really have is a setting with a null set for protagonists. There are <i>characters</i> of course, but they are the swirl of the environment. Not protagonists.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, a setting where the focus of the setting was really the characters, I'm not really interested at all in doing that setting. Because, ultimately the setting worked because of the characters -- and we're going to be making up all new characters. As Graham wrote: "If you do what they did--well, it's been done. If you don't, why not any somewhat-generic SF setting?"<br/><br/>But a setting as setting, waiting for character to arrive, that has appeal to me. And that distinction seems to be at play for others on this thread. That's my guess, at least. By being "first in" with the protagonists in a setting-as-setting and no story having bee told, the tale is open to the social interactions between the player made characters as a fresh and novel experience. And that's where the juice is.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            most star wars and firefly games i have played in were far away from the characters those properties are known for, we interacted with a few known supporting characters or antagonists but thats all.<br/>
<br/>
we did play the first adventure in mouse guard with the primary mice from that series, and thats a fun way to learn the game.<br/>
<br/>
i think it's nice to have some common ground to fall back on or use as a starting point. not to say licenses don't come with some down sides but i think worthy games can come of it.                        </div>

No, no... not at all. I just wanted to make it clear I wasn't saying you or other didn't have fun in license settings, nor that it was impossible to do so. I just wanted to make sure you felt no need to defend the fun you've had. At least on my account.                        </div>

                            Having played some badass Mouse Guard games and enjoying a number of fanfic-y hacks (Avatar: The Last Airbender, New Mutants, etc.), I actually think there's plenty of room for doing the character-based stuff that Christopher is talking about in a way that's much more effective than most Star Wars RPGs have done.  I think the real problem is that most games don't help you create characters that are as interesting and compelling as the Star Wars protagonists and put them in situations as interesting and compelling as the core situations of Star Wars (trapped in a trash compactor! about to be thrown into a sandworm's mouth by an ugly alien crimelord! fighting your own cyborg father on the scaffolds of a floating city!).  But Star Wars RPGs don't actually tell me how to do that in play, right?  So you end up playing second fiddle to the Star Wars stuff that IS really cool, unless your group has a GM or players who totally get it and make it happen, despite the lack of support from the game.<br/><br/>However, Mouse Guard and AW and Danger Patrol and a bunch of other games are great at showing you how to create badass, compelling protagonists and dropping them right into compelling situations.  It's just that licensed games typically handle their properties very carefully, with gloves on, without really digging into the meat of them and showing you how to get at the fun.  But if you're willing to dig deep into the property, as a designer, I don't think there's any reason licensed games can't do the same thing, as Mouse Guard and Burning Empires demonstrate.                        </div>

You must make a goal oriented person who found their way into the service of the guard. it's limited and directed to give exactly the kind of experience i wanted from mouse guard.                        </div>

                            Wow, blast from the past.  <br><br/>In the past four years, I think I've tended more towards using pre-existing settings rather than original world-building.  For me, I find that original world-building is good as: <br/><br/>1) Introducing major elements that contradict existing genres and settings.  For example, if I want a world where humans are a minor race, I have limited choices.  <br/><br/>2) Conveying a feeling of the setting being strange, alien, and/or unfamiliar.  For example, I ran a campaign set on a strange fantasy world where the PCs were children from our world who had crossed over - in the genre of Oz or Narnia.  The setting being original was important for the feeling of strangeness.  This may blend into <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> as "sense of wonder." <br/><br/>3) As an end in itself - enjoying the creation of a setting and collaborative detailing of the setting.  <br/><br/>For most of my games, though, I find that these three haven't come up much as priorities.  If I just want to focus on characters, then original world-building doesn't have much pay-off for me.                        </br></div>

                            Interesting that this thread should get resurrected just when three very interesting licensed games are coming on to the market and possibly doing some very new things:  Smallville, Leverage and of course the Dresden Files.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>In one type (Buffy, Star Wars, Firefly) we have a clutch of characters that are the focus of the setting. All the mythology and setting and stuff actually takes a back seat to the social interactions of the characters. (Which is true, by the way, of almost anything we call a story.)<br/><br/>In the other type (Glorantha, Forgotten Realms), what we really have is a setting with a null set for protagonists. There are <i>characters</i> of course, but they are the swirl of the environment. Not protagonists.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, a setting where the focus of the setting was really the characters, I'm not really interested at all in doing that setting. Because, ultimately the setting worked because of the characters -- and we're going to be making up all new characters.</blockquote>
You know, I should be agreeing with this one hundred percent, and yet I have to say, I am quite curious about the upcoming <i>Leverage </i>and <i>Smallville </i>games. <br/><br/>However, I should point out that I made it through one and a half episodes of <i>Leverage </i>before saying to myself, wow this is sexist <i>and</i> boring. Whereas <i>Smallville </i>took me six episodes to finally accept that it was too repetitive (so far I had been doing ok with the sexism in it, but sooner or later it would have become too much I'm sure).<br/><br/>But, a game to do cool heists? Or another one to do teen superheroine melodrama? Those seem super cool, if they are done right. <i>Smallville </i>is the one that risks too much to focus on the setting, which would be a shame, because rules about how to properly create an interesting small town  would be way more useful, whereas <i>Leverage </i>shouldn't have any important setting information from what I can gather.<br/><br/>And if there was a <i>Buffy</i>, <i>Firefly</i>, or <i>Star Wars</i> game that had interesting mechanics, I'd probably be interested in those as well. But, yes, games with a huge setting dump, pictures from the property, tons of property character stats, and rules that could just as easily be found in any other game, those are a waste of my time.                        </div>

                            Man, it would be interesting to see a Star Wars game that helped you make <i>your own</i> Star Wars, <i>your own</i> Darth Vader, etc. Like stripping the formula for success out of Star Wars and giving it to you to play with. Because every Star Wars game I've ever played was, indeed, about carefully avoiding the stuff that the Star Wars stories were about, and playing in whatever space remained in that playground.<br/><br/>Just like how Lady Blackbird is kind of a variation on Firefly. <br/><br/>Is there anything out there that does this?                        </div>

Remember JDCorley's Law of Licensed Gaming:<br/><br/>Bad source material means good gaming.<br/><br/>This is because source material you don't like has something about it that you think could be better - characters, setting, attitudes, etc.<br/><br/>That is where your own play comes into its power.<br/><br/>If you like source material, you like it because of the combination of everything that it has, so your gaming has to accommodate that combination, which limits it (sometimes in very fruitful ways, but still.)<br/><br/>I can't stand Buffy, I think it's garbage, but I love the Buffy RPG and Buffyverse as a RPG setting for <i>exactly that reason.</i><br/><br/>Bad source material means good gaming. Remember that.                        </div>

Yes, this is what I was trying to say. I like the Buffy show, but the rpg does nothing to help me get a game that teams up an ultra-privileged authority figure with marginalized teens who possess magical powers (and non-marginalized teens who don't), in a random small town, fighting demonic forces that are actually metaphors for teenage life. I don't want to play <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, if I want to experience that I can rewatch the series. What I want is a rule-set that helps me create what I find cool from Buffy.                        </div>

I think this brings up a good point.  For licensed setting with prior stories like Buffy or Star Wars, there can be many different ways that one can relate back to the canonical stories.  The setting itself is different than the narrative structure of the original stories.  For example, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are in the same setting, and have many similarities.  Still, they are also quite distinct.  It sounds like Dan's game ("Final Hour of a Storied Age") would not be useful for a game that was more like The Hobbit.  Similarly, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea is a setting for a number of different kinds of stories.  <br/><br/>While I use licensed settings regularly, I rarely try to reproduce the story structure of the canonical stories without significant changes.  So, for example, I played the Buffy RPG for several years.  Our game was patterned as a television series full of life metaphors, but it wasn't about teenagers (unlike what chearns is looking for).                        </div>

                            Having not read every response I'll throw my two cents into the hat.<br/><br/>The biggest issue for me with licensed RPGs is that they're almost always given to a publisher that has some major clout, and that publisher has a tendency of just using their system for it. Wizards of the Coast using d20 for Star Wars is a perfect example. Margaret Weis Productions using Cortex for Supernatural and Serenity is another example. Luke Crane using Burning Wheel for Mouse Guard even. Now d20 and Cortex are bog standard generic systems, and Burning Wheel is actually quite interesting, I still don't see how it does Mouse Guard. I can see how BW is great for Lord of the Rings, and in fact I'd love to see Luke get the opportunity to work on that license, as it would be really, really, appropriate. But most of the time a license goes to a publisher who will slap the license setting onto their inhouse system, and it most likely won't be appropriate. As a big Supernatural fan I took a solid read through the RPG. I really liked the content, the writing style was even appropriate, and the examples of play were excellent, but the system was just boooooring. I can't remember anything useful about Cortex, other than if you've played d20, GURPS or the like you've played Cortex (for all the importance any mechanical differences from those 2 systems have).<br/><br/>What I'd really like to see is a licensed game that actually takes the setting and designs a system from scratch to fit it. Now that happened with Dragon Age, although there was a great deal of arguing about whether it actually hit DA well or whether it was just a good RPG but quite different. I still haven't gotten around to playing the actual DA:O CRPG so I can't comment on that, but at least we have an example of at least once a system being designed for the setting. If we go back far enough, WEG did that with Star Wars too - given it has a mechanics stat - it actually treats mechanical aptitude as an attribute along with agility and strength. I understand the D6 system was already around before that, but you can see at the very least some customisation at the base level of the mechanics.<br/><br/>If I see a licensed RPG, I want the system to be unique, and well suited to the license, not a situation where using something different actually nails it much better. <br/><br/>PS: BESM sort of straddles the two, it was an explicit anime RPG so it made sense having the licenses go on top of it, and certainly for the time when it was popular it was an appropriate system, but at the same time <i>none</i> of the BESM licenses ever interested me in the slightest.                        </div>

                            Actually, it was not wanting to bolt a license onto a generic system that drove my decision-making for SMALLVILLE and LEVERAGE's versions of the Cortex System. I knew I wanted to overhaul the rules anyway, and in both games there are some common (but new) mechanics, but each game has been designed specifically to model the genre/premise of the license.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think SUPERNATURAL works great as-is, but then it's a monster of the week action-horror game with shotguns, sneaking around, and stuff. You could do something less traditional with it, but you don't need to.<br/>

                            It's not as if the Cortex system is bad, but it's just nondescript. I'm far more interested in seeing what Dogs in the Vineyard can do with Supernatural.                        </div>
