<blockquote><cite>Judd posted</cite>"My last regular game was a FATE supernatural western for Fred, Rob, and their posse, in which they all played hanged criminals brought back from the dead to work for the Devil."<br/><br/>This demands its own thread.<br/><br/>Sounds awesome.</blockquote>
The bit in quotes within the quote was made by Matt Gandy, a friend of mine.<br/><br/>His game, Covenant, was as he describes.  Pretty awesome -- he made use of an earlier version of Fate than is coming out in Spirit of the Century, and I'm afraid the game got derailed by all of the growing pains that went into getting the new version of Fate put together.  But the mood of the thing, the use of multiple different colored fate points in order to achieve different effects, gave me a really nice feeling about how it went, for as long as it lasted.                </div>
