The thread collecting links for all of these posts is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2866" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The reason for this is fairly straightforward: while not everyone agrees with this assessment, it is my belief that most RPG rulebooks are essentially teaching texts and/or workbooks or unconsciously modeled after them. In short, an RPG rulebook's essential task is to teach the game to the person reading it.<br/><br/>As such, being aware of some of the rules of instruction and learning can help you deliver your game into the minds of the players as clearly and painlessly as possible.<br/><br/>This particular post focuses specifically on teaching the player how to perform a Task.  Throw out RPG jargon and think in terms of teaching a skill: the process of character creation is a Task with a number of Sub-tasks.  Conflict Resolution is a task.  Each section that discusses a new Task that the player needs to learn is, in essence, a Lesson.  You're the teacher.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Structure of a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Lesson\xe2\u20ac\x9d</span></b><br/><br/>Delivery of material in a lesson follows this flow:<br/><br/><code><br/>[Introduce the \xe2\u20ac\u0153thing to learn\xe2\u20ac\x9d] -&gt; [Present the Content] -&gt; [Give them something to Do With It] <br/>      -&gt; [Monitor Performance] -&gt; [Provide Feedback] -&gt; [Summarize what they just did]<br/></code><br/><br/>In short: <b><i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Say what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going to tell them, then tell them what you mean to tell them, then summarize what you just told them.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i></b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>How to break down a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Lesson\xe2\u20ac\x9d or Topic</b></span><br/><br/>State the Objective<br/>* State the task we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going to learn how to perform, including what material we need to do it.<br/>* Identify what should be produced out of this process.<br/><br/>Prerequisites<br/>* Review any prerequisite material required to start the current task.<br/>* Define (or repeat the definition of) any new tasks.<br/>* Provide a glossary of terms or a bibliography of resources (often simply references to other areas of the game text).<br/><br/>Benefits<br/>Explain why the task is important<br/>* Benefits that are gained if the task is performed well.<br/>* Discuss problems that may occur if the tasked is performed poorly.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>* Identify how this part fits into the overall game.<br/>* State the purpose of this task and how it relates to similar tasks within the game.<br/>* Explain when the task is performed.<br/>* Explain where the task is performed.<br/>* Explain who performs the task and who else can be called upon for help in performing the task.<br/><br/>Provide Task DETAIL (see also: Explaining Tasks in Detail, below)<br/>* If they're are sub-tasks in the Task, List and explain each sub-task, specifically.<br/>** If the procedure involves 3 or more steps, lay out the explanation so that there are \xe2\u20ac\u02dcmini-reviews\xe2\u20ac\u2122 of the material (via examples) throughout the procedure.<br/>** Include any cautions, or tips for successful completion.<br/>** State who will monitor the output of the task: the GM, the other players, everyone, or the individual players themselves.<br/><br/>Summary of the Lesson<br/>* Cover how the group leader (GM or what have you) will recall the key points of the topic.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b><i>Explaining Tasks in Detail</i></b><br/><b>1.</b> All sub-tasks and tasks should have examples, if possible.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> Make examples as realistic and game-like as possible, with all the real-life warts on.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> When giving directions for tasks:<br/>(a) State why the task is important.<br/>(b) Describe what the players should do.

There are a dozen ways that someone can "State who will monitor the output of the task," to stay with your example.  Doing it explicitly is one.  Doing so via examples is even better.<br/><br/>What's important is that <b>the person writing the text be aware of the step, and know how they're addressing it</b>.  They can be all sneaky and subtle about it, or they can really lay it out there baldly -- it might be obvious to the reader, or they might never consciously realize it's even been done -- but it does need to be done.  (My personal method, which isn't the most efficient, is to 'just write' the basic Thing That's In My Head, then go back and check it against these steps to see what I haven't covered; get that creative burst out there, then hang it out on a framework and see where the holes are.  Starting with the structure and writing TO that structure can mess with the creative joy and fun for some people -- I'm one of them, for sure, and that's okay.)<br/><br/>As an litmus test, grab one of the RPGs you think of as really really strong -- something that clearly communicates the system to the reader, and gets them confident in their ability to play and maybe even excited to do so.   See if they do this stuff (I'll bet they do) and take note of how.  My personal favorite test for this is Dogs in the Vineyard.  Vincent teaches his game in some very subtle ways, but he hits these steps; almost every one.<br/><br/>And that's another thing:  you don't have to hit every step.  Not EVERY step.  Some steps you don't really get to skip, but some you can.  However, even if you skip them, <i>especially</i> if you skip them, you should know exactly why you did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65171/#Comment_65171" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T20:05:49+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  8:05PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if it fits entirely within this section, but I was trained that it is often better to teach a skill in reverse order so that you can anticipate what the outcome should be. An example from my Kinko's days: if you are teaching comb binding start with everything punched and ready to bind. Then explicitly tell them how to put the comb on. Then have them tell you how to put the comb on while you do it. Then let them tell you while they do it. Then you back up to the step before, say punching the paper, and go through the show/tell back/do steps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65176/#Comment_65176" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T20:46:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  8:46PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that goes along with "If a particular task or subject is very complicated to understand, cover it early and revisit it frequently throughout the text."<br/><br/>It's a tricky thing -- I can say it, but it's hard to see how to do it, sometimes -- how, for example, do you introduce Bringing Down the Pain early in the TSoY text and revisit it often with more and more complicated examples?

I've no experience with them, though.<br/><br/>I think Dogs is great at teaching the game, and it's interesting to go through and look at that text and the list of things to do when you're explaining a task to someone.  Another good example is Primetime Adventures, and you can draw connections from the lists I've posted to the things Matt does with the rules -- also of interest: the first 50 pages are clearly mapped for teaching, then we get to Creating an Episode and it gets a Leeeeetle muddier, but he turns around and provides a whole appendix with more conflicts in it, thus covering that possible problem. <br/><br/>But that's sort of me picking at low-hanging fruit for the answer:  let me go through some games and see if I can't find a surprise example.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'll grab one and point out the stuff it did AND didn't do.  Something.  That'll take a day or two, but I'll give it a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65309/#Comment_65309" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:21:00+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doyce</cite>Delivery of material in a lesson follows this flow:<br/><br/><code><br/>[Introduce the \xe2\u20ac\u0153thing to learn\xe2\u20ac\x9d] -&gt; [Present the Content] -&gt; [Give them something to Do With It]<br/>-&gt; [Monitor Performance] -&gt; [Provide Feedback] -&gt; [Summarize what they just did]<br/></code><br/><br/>In short:<b><i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Say what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going to tell them, then tell them what you mean to tell them, then summarize what you just told them.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i></b></blockquote>\nWoah, wait.

That's exactly what Vincent's doing.  Look at how Mortal Coil structures the section on creating the Theme Document: "Here's is what you do. Here is are some examples. Now you do it.  Got it?  Okay, next task..."<br/><br/>My comparison of those two phrases above may be flip, but "tell them what you mean to tell them" is a broad term that encompasses (if you want it to) things like giving them something to do, monitoring that, and giving feedback (or telling them how to give feedback to each other).<br/><br/>The book all by itself is a fine thing -- it can teach a lot on it's own -- but we're allowed to use 'instructions to the group about to play this game (or in the process of playing it)' as part of the teaching.  We're allowed to treat a book-directed group activity as part of the teaching process.  Groups teaching themselves/each other as they learn is one of the best tools around.  It's one of the best, most appropriate tools to use, really, given what we're teaching them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65320/#Comment_65320" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:52:00+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, but in my experience, "tell them" means "tell them." It means nothing about monitoring, activity, feedback, or anything but simple transmission. I've met lots of teachers who tell kids all kinds of things day in and day out, giving them both intro and wrap-up, and it's awful. Compressing a monitoring/feedback loop into the phrase "tell them" doesn't cut it for me.<br/><br/>Even when a book tells me, "Go do this and then come back. Did you do it? Go do it. Ok, let's keep going," I usually don't, and I'd imagine that most other readers don't as well.
