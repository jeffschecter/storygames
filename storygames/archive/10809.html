Christian's comments resonate with me. I didn't have/play GTAIV (but had and played all the others in the series; only completed Vice City and III thanks to cheat codes), but for me this was "Final Fantasy 12 aka XII". Beautiful graphics, probably the best for that console. I even liked the combat and levelling mechanic. However, the characters had no interesting parts to them whatsoever (save the bunny girl-Chewbacca analogue, who had this whole Exile story going on that was addressed), the story had not only plot elements lifted from Star Wars, but entire FMV scenes that look like they came out of one of the trilogies. Finally, I don't remember anything about the antagonists save that there was a lame twin brother plot thing. And the setting was a vanilla shlock fantasy blaaaah.<br><br>Gorgeous graphics.<br>Great gameplay.<br/>Great voicework/"acting".<br/><br/>Uninteresting setting<br/>Bland and uninteresting characters<br/>Character, monster design was uninteresting (note: Here I am actually comparing the game to FFX or FFVII, both of which had far better character design, concept design, etc)<br/>Forgettable antagonists<br/>Everyday overarching plot, no surprises<br/><br/>I ended up pushing through the damn thing, cause I'm obsessive like that. But instead of being all OCD and collecting all (or any) secret powerups and maxing levels and stuff, I just hit my "boredom point" then drove a straight red line into the heart of the game until it was Over, then never touched it again. When this game comes up on Gamers With Jobs (it's a website with a feel similar to Story Games, but focused on video games), pretty much everyone chimes in with, "Yeah, I didn't think it downright sucked or anything... It just didn't keep me interested long enough to complete it."<br/><br/>Contrasting that to my experiences with Final Fantasy X/X-2, which suffer from the opposite problems for me: I think the gameplay is wonky and cumbersome at times, unintuitive, slow, unreflective ("its done this way because that's the way it was in all the previous games"), aimed at obsessive shut-ins. But every other element hits me in the sweet spot: Characters, antagonists (save Seymour's name), world setting, world and character design, unique ("confusing", even?) plot... I've played FFX through from start to finish 3 times, and the International version once as well (which boasts a refined experience system where choices actually matter). And right now I'm on my second replay of FFX-2, 30-some hours in (play a few hours a week).<br/><br/>I'm wondering what the RPG Analogue for this observation would be? Loving Exalted for the setting, but then giving up because of the rules?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX" title="EnricPDX"><img alt="EnricPDX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX">EnricPDX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239734/#Comment_239734" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T07:21:10+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  7:21AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 7:23AM by EnricPDX.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>The reason people don't finish games is not because they're too hard, but because there are too many games and not enough time.</blockquote>\nJust to add another data point, this actually is the case for me. I'd love to finish more games, but I don't have nearly enough time. As someone who loves open worlds, emergent gameplay, and personalized experiences, but doesn't have sixty hours to invest in a game, I frequently find myself wishing more games were short but dense with content. If I could finish a game in six or eight hours, but knew that there were alternate storylines and whatnot that I hadn't experienced, I'd be substantially more likely to come back to that game in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239740/#Comment_239740" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T08:08:11+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  8:08AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 8:08AM by T-Boy.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I laugh bitterly when I see this, and remember Yahtzee Croshaw and his assertion <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/6340-Extra-Punctuation-Call-of-Juarez-Bound-in-Blood" rel="nofollow">that hardcore gamers are those who get it</a>.\n<blockquote><cite>Ben "Yahztee" Croshaw, that fool, said that, <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/6340-Extra-Punctuation-Call-of-Juarez-Bound-in-Blood.2" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</cite>'Hardcore' doesn't mean 'Halo-playing twitchy fourteen-year-old douchebag.'

Do I want to spend another 20 hours collecting 200 coins/stars/dealybobs to open up another level?  Maybe not.  Is shooting 50 guys in a minute much different than shooting 30 guys in a minute?  Maybe not.  This is the kind of stuff that's easier to put in a game than either another unique level design, new gameplay mechanics, or extra story.<br/><br/>RPGs have the benefit that you're not forced into pre-designing all of your content- you can alter it to better fit what everyone's into, and that's assuming you're not playing a game that has people doing that as part of play anyway.  Typically, though, when people -do- lose interest, the campaign "falls apart" AKA people stop playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239767/#Comment_239767" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T09:23:25+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  9:23AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often find the early stages of games are more exciting.

Because, unlike an RPG book, I can't even derive any pleasure from simply reading the text and looking at the pretty pictures. I feel like many hours of product are being willfully withheld from me, and that pisses me off.<br/><br/>Last game I just let slip away was COD4. Got maybe a third of the way into it, and it was just sort of meh. I hammered through Ghost Recon 2 but the ending was a huge letdown -- but the fact of the matter was, I really wanted to see the endgame.<br/><br/>That may be, for me, the takeaway: How do you build in, and then deliver on, high expectations for your game's endgame? That question remains completely unaddressed in many RPGs. I don't know that simply having an end necessarily means expectations have been set high for the endgame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239777/#Comment_239777" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T10:13:03+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 10:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 10:13AM by Andrew Kenrick.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The recent Alone in the Dark game on the 360 was innovative in that you could skip scenes, or entire chapters, and the game would fill you in on what you'd missed ("previously on...").

I mean, as developers, we want you to get to the end, because that's the only way you'll see all the cool stuff we spent money/time making. Those of you who wish you could make it to the end of games, but run up against the natural limits of your ability to wrangle a controller, do you make sure you're playing on the easiest difficulty level for games that offer the option?<br/><br/>Adaptive difficulty is a cool feature, but it doesn't map smoothly to every game, and it's also a tricky thing to do, something that usually needs to be designed for early on in the project. It's not something you can, nor should, put in every game.<br/><br/>Nintendo actually is working on games that will just play themselves for you, that you can choose to interact with when you like, but otherwise leave on autopilot. Maybe this will be the greatest thing ever, although it certainly doesn't map to my personal predilections. If it proves popular, this would essentially open up a market of gaming consumers quite different from anything that exists right now. Exactly what experience that group is looking for, and how best to cater to them would have yet to be determined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239832/#Comment_239832" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T13:34:55+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  1:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Here are all the chapters.

I don't mean just in terms of repeat playability but I mean to be steady sellers.  A game is considered "dead" from a business model perspective six months after it's release.  We aren't thinking in terms of building games that will still be selling two years from now steadily.<br/><br/>Part of that is the increased emphasis on graphics and the way that advances in technology push that such that games simply begin to *look* old.  But that isn't the whole story.  A lot of it has to do with just not thinking about game play and business practices in terms of producing a durable product that will still be fun to new people in a year after its release.<br/><br/>I'd love to work for a studio focused on producing a steady of stream of smaller continuously selling games.  Something that worked more like a board game company rather than the more Hollywood like multi-million dollar "project" based approach focused on flash-in-the-pan summer blockbuster mentality.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239846/#Comment_239846" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T15:13:55+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  3:13PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To put it another way, EVERYONE that plays Peggle finishes a game of Peggle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239868/#Comment_239868" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T18:51:47+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  6:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't get very far in Bioshock either.

That was true when I was at Sierra ten years ago, and it's true today.  Sierra called putting a lot of effort into a dynamic ending for a game "leaving money on the table."  With many companies making longer games (say 40+ hours of gameplay), the ending is what gets short shrift, in part because...yeah, see above.  And because it's often coming together toward the end of the dev cycle.  There's a feedback loop in operation there.  Less compelling ending...fewer compelled gamers.<br/><br/>The drop-off in SP completion isn't happening because of too many games, though it may be impacted by the prevalence of huge timesuck MMORPGs like WOW, where the social dimension makes up the primary crack-addicting ingredient.  I suspect the behavior has more to do with a fatigue level that creeps in after a certain amount of time on a game, maybe because many games, the longer you play them, distill down to a flatter experience.  Put another way, once the novelty wears off, the game's charm wears off, so that increasing difficulty level transforms into a barrier rather than motivation.  Some players, maybe the die-hards or players for whom that game's experience really resonates, may continue on regardless.<br/><br/>Have there been any studies on why people quit games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teplin" title="Teplin"><img alt="Teplin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teplin">Teplin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239972/#Comment_239972" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T01:42:16+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  1:42AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy<br/>I didn't have/play GTAIV (but had and played all the others in the series; only completed Vice City and III thanks to cheat codes) </cite></blockquote>\nThis.  <br/><br/>I'm not a hardcore gamer, and  I don't buy a lot of games, but I complete pretty much every game I buy because if it's taking me more then a couple tries to get past a mission/level, and I'm getting frustrated, then I'm online looking for cheat codes or walkthroughs.

Are most people really willing to shelve a game rather than use cheat codes to get on with it?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>"Here are all the chapters. Play them how you want."</blockquote>\nYes!  Because it's usually not like this, I have to make a ton of savegames just so I can go back and replay a part of the game that I particularly enjoyed.  It would be so much easier to just pick the part of the game I want to play.  I don't see any downside to having this as an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239975/#Comment_239975" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T02:33:52+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  2:33AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A recent game, Demon Soul promote itself as a "hard" game, this aspect of the game attracted the attention of many game reviewers.<br/>BrainyGamer posted some interesting observation <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2009/10/tough-sell.html" rel="nofollow">about it</a> and about <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2009/10/thank-you-sir-may-i-have-another.html" rel="nofollow">game difficulty</a> on his blog. Later he talked also about how <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2009/10/easy-does-it.html" rel="nofollow">easy games</a> can be also interesting.<br/><br/>There was also a lot of interesting discussion about the new Prince of Persia, how Ubisoft removed player dead from the game and how it changed and influenced the game experience.<br/><br/>For my part I enjoy hard games and I would feel cheated if every games needed to accomodate players who prefer to walk through games. Nearly all games already feature a "easy mode" that let you finish the game pretty easily. I consider myself a average gamer, I dont consider myself "good", but just "ok on average", I can't really compete in player vs players games and I managed to finish many games considered hard on the "normal" difficulty level. Often I find games too easy. Sometime I find some part of a game more challenging but it will usually not stop me from playing and from overcoming the obstacle. <br/><br/>I understand that some games could be designed for free exploration where you browse around chapters (and it would be interesting), but I really don't think that all game need to aim for this. Challenging game are fine and usually offer a great gaming experience. <br/>Personnaly I find challenging game quite rewarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239988/#Comment_239988" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T08:12:02+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  8:12AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teplin</cite>Are most people really willing to shelve a game rather than use cheat codes to get on with it?</blockquote>\nThere are lots of things cheat codes won't help you with.

I would prefer that they design games where you don't need to do those task or to be challenged by those tasks (when they aim for a specific target audience).<br/><br/>If they have to tune down the difficulty of a challenge to the point that you have to offer the players the option to remove or bypass this gameplay, maybe they should simply remove this gameplay and focus on something else. <br/><br/>Or I would prefer that they offer a alternate route that challenge something else instead of saying "well, let just ignore this part or this aspect of the game". I mean when you talk with your friend in tabletop rpg, this must be what you are idealy doing, you modify your gameplay experience instead of removing a part of it.<br/><br/>Anyway, in a video game, do you find it satisfying to skip some stuff when you have the option to do it? Bypassing stuff, like using cheats dont seem very fun or satisfying. <br/><br/>But I agree that a game that would let you browse it chapters and choose the chapters you want to play could be interesting. But maybe you will now have the problem that most peoples try every chapters but only finish 30% or 40% of them.  <br/><br/>I imagine that the problem is also about audience targeting and audience expectation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Only 30% finish GTA4 - Page 2 - Story

Virality is the big one, and installation resources. Although the biggest of all is genre. WoW was made for MMO players to play an MMO. Farmville was made for Facebook users to play a casual game at work, at home, from a phone, wherever they can get to Facebook.<br/><br/>WoW: To play WoW you need to purchase the game (in a story or download) for $30+, install and patch it (which can take 1-2 hours or more if your connection sucks)<br/>Farmville: You can play Farmville by clicking on a link of a friend who just played Farmville.<br/><br/>WoW: The basic unit of accomplishment is a quest, and takes about 5-10 minutes.<br/>Farmville: The basic unit of accomplishment is a crop, which you plant (and harvest a pre-planted crop) in about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>There are casual games that do the hero's narrative (or at least anti-hero's narrative) that are close to, or bigger than WoW. Mafia Wars and other Wars titles. There are others that add more gamey elements, even maps and graphics and they are decidedly smaller.  Game players don't care about graphical richness and less so world depth (something as a writer of Facebook games, hits home every day). Although I think you are right that the social aspect is something that's ready to be tapped into to a greater degree than Little Big Planet and Spore did, or attempted to do (and better than Uncharted 2's much maligned Twitter <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spam</span> announcements).<br/><br/>I think there's already been a game that's blended richness of graphics and the world with casual gameplay. The Sims. 100 million copies sold blows WoW and any facebook games out of the water.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240249/#Comment_240249" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-03T08:05:36+00:00" title="November  3, 2009  8:05AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play a lot of games, compared to the average Joe.  I also buy a lot of games.  I do not consider myself particularly hardcore, but I like some videogame time to myself in the week.  Plus my other half works weekends, so it's not hard for me to put in 20 hours of videogames over a weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI own (or have owned) 7 out of the 9 games listed on the "% of gamers who finish the main campaign" graph.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played Fable 2 (because I didn't like Fable 1) or BF Bad Company.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have finished 5 of the 7 games games I own.  That is, played through the campaign mode at least once.  Usually exactly once.<br/>\nThe two I have not completed are CoD:W@W and R6:V2.  These were both because they were bad games, with what I considered serious design flaws which detracted massively from the gameplay to the point where I didn't enjoy playing them.  Only R6:V2 was actually too hard to be fun, which was one of it's design flaws (IMHO etc etc).  W@W had shitty AI which ganked you, so maybe that was a "too hard" issue as well, I dunno.  I was still making progress, but not having fun, when I gave up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt comes to me as no surprise that over twice as many people finish GoW/Gow2/CoD4/Halo3 than GTA4.  Regardless of the quality of GTA4, the length of the game is the main issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat down with GoW2 and finished it in one weekend.  Basically about 6-7 hours.  It was fun, but short.  Likewise CoD4 and GoW.  Halo 3 was nearer 11-12 hours, but that was me being anal and going back for skulls and secrets and whatnot and I also played some co-op with someone I knew from work.  We did the whole game on Ultra Hardcore Nutter Mode (which isn't so hard when there are 3 of you playing)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 360 version of GTA4 has an achievement (which is considered hard to get) for finishing the main plot in under 30 hours.  I don't know exactly what my play time was but IIRC it was something like 50-55 hours when I completed the campaign.  So, in the time it took me to finish GTA4, I could have completed all of the top 4 on that list put together (and probably something else to boot)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat all the pundits are missing is the time it takes.  It's like comparing how many people who've seen one Star Wars film have seen all 3 to how many people who've seen one episode of Star Trek have seen all 700.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240315/#Comment_240315" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-03T15:12:24+00:00" title="November  3, 2009  3:12PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, guys!
