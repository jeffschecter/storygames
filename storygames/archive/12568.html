It's not specifically for three players but based on my experience with the game I'd say three is a fairly ideal number, especially for a multi-session game. The dice mechanic is extremely simple, so no problem for online play. It might serve as a nice bridge towards GM-full games as well, since it does still have a fairly strong GM-player dynamic -- the roles simply rotate -- while also including crucial input from the third+ player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282289/#Comment_282289" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T02:45:06+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  2:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's not specifically for three players</blockquote>\nMy experience of Shock is that it specifically requires four players. Each player has an antagonist created by an opposing player at the table (which is played by a fixed person). Adapting the game to occlude that purpose is the kind of thing I'm reluctant to try. Now, having said that, I haven't read the book. I was instructed how to play by Gregor Hutton and Joe Prince (wow!) at Conpulsion 2010 this year. They might have got the game wrong, of course, but I think they (or Malcolm anyway) has played this with Joshua Newman, so they probably got it right.
