<p>No, seriously ... when you drive your character toward death, how do you want it to happen?</p>
<p>These days I want my character to die as he lived.  I don't really care about the consequences (did his death have meaning, do people care) but I do want to make sure that if he was a big fat honking coward then he dies because he meets the monster he can't outrun, whereas if he's a big dumb barbarian he dies because he hits the monster that he can't outfight.  Switching those around would be goofy.</p>
<p>I <strong>used to</strong> want my character deaths to be big and meaningful.  I wanted the character to be deeply misunderstood, and to have everyone hate him, and then he would give his life in one spectacular act of redeeming heroism, and everyone would gather around his body and lament that they had not realized what a spectacular hero he <em>always was</em>.  Oh, and also, for the women, that they hadn't gone on dates with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a little disturbing in retrospect.</p>
<p>I genuinely wonder whether I'd have been in trouble if anyone had <strong>ever</strong> acceded to my requests that they view my character suicides as admirable and redeeming.  Luckily for me they mostly said "Damn, Tony!  Why'd you try to shield my fighter from the dragon-flame with your body?  I've got a ring of fire resistance, and your mage had ... what ... two hit points?  You're an idiot!"</p>

                            Fuckers, you always take all the good answers. <br/><br/>Um, all I can add to the above is that I want my character to die as a result of something that I did, not the results of a GM forced plot or random roll. (Random rolls that came because of something I choose are fine, of course.) <br/><br/>I also want there to be enough build up of character, and situation, and emotional investment that when the character dies I feel it. Killing off a character I don't care about, that doesn't have me in the gut yet, is just like killing an NPC when I'm the GM -- its a little nifty, but not what I want when my PC bites it. <br/><br/>Finally, and this is my selfish part, I want the death to get the other players. Not in the "oh my god the misunderstood hero!" way that Tony outlined, but in the "fuck! that was hard core!" way. Which is funny, because just like Tony I used to have a big thing for the explosive death of the misunderstood one -- and it never got the other players.                        </div>

<p>Oooh ... I didn't even realize the sheer brilliance of such a ploy, in terms of annoying people.  Figure out a question that has one or two absolutely primo answers that everyone will gravitate to, list them, then say "So what do <em>you</em> think?"  Then everyone has to choose between (a) not saying anything, which is impossible for internet-addicts such as myself, (b) saying something obviously derivative or (c) saying something lame.</p>
<p>It's GENIUS!</p>
<p>EDIT: Except that, of course, everyone always thinks of better answers than my lame ones, so it's not a ploy <em>I</em> could try.  Still, genius for somebody!</p>

<p>I'm not sure I want to know how my characters die. Which means it's hard to answer Tony's question about driving toward death...</p>
<p>Once I am done with them, I want to leave them alone to live out their sunset years as they see fit.</p>
<p>But if I was doing as Tony is, then I would want my character to die because his principles pushed him there -- there isn't room in the world for this thing and me, so we will fight until one dies of it.</p>

                            I have a very hard time thinking about the deaths of my characters.  Not because it's unacceptable to me for my characters to die, but because...character death is  an emotional blind spot?  I don't find character death very interesting.  Not my own, not those of others.  <br/>
<br/>
The "I want to go out in a blaze of glory"/"I want to go out in a way which drives home to my survivor friends how wonderful me and my sacrifice were" were just never very interesting roleplaying moments to me.  And "how would my character approach death...I don't think my characters think about it themselves.  And I'm not sure I'm wired to think about it, except as a series of reactions in the moment.  That is to say, I can play one of my characters dying, but it'll be a surprise to them and a surprise to me, or the logic of the moment will play out with little or no philosophical input from me.<br/>
<br/>
 My characters, and the characters in the games I play, very very rarely die.  I honestly cannot remember the last time one of my characters died in a game, and I can't remember the last time anyone died in a game I played, and in fact, I cannot remember any deaths in games at all.  I mean, ever.  In all my roleplaying.  Don't remember the deaths.  They don't impact my memory, if they happened. I remember some deaths as narrative/status/game mechanic transitions for the character (character is now a ghost, keeps playing, character is resurrected as a cyborg keeps playing, character reincarnates as a dog, etc), but that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
This only applies literally to death itself .  I remember people taking big risks that lead to changes to their character (physical disfigurment, insanity, loss of precious objects, severe alteration/destruction or relationships or social status), but not deaths.  Does my brain just close off those files and eventually empty the recycle bin on them?  I don't know.  I don't know.  If I substitute "death" for "action which brings large change, probably painful", then the answer is I'm pretty utilitarian. I take the action, I make the choice, because it's the thing that's necessary at the moment, and perhaps because it will hurt me less to make the choice than for the burden of it to fall on someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Some gamers I've known, or at least read about, obviously see character death as a potential dramatic pinnacle, or at least a logical aspect of character existence to consider and in some cases embrace, but for whatever reason the concept has never gotten it's hooks into me emotionally, not in a roleplaying context anyway.  Projecting into a theoretical future, I reckon my characters either die of old age, or they die of cancer or heart disease, or they die in auto accidents, or they die in battle, they die in the various typical ways death happens.  "But that is another story", as it were, not the one I'm reading/writing/hearing around the campfire.                        </div>

                            Narrativist answer:  I want my characters' death to reflect back over his storyline.  The most satisfying character death I had was doing something totally out of character (a little wormy bastard faced down the evil he was serving and got eaten by it), but because it gave focus to everything he'd done previously, and that was really cool, because he was a cool character.  Whether this is how he lived or a forceful rejection of everything he once stood for is beside the point.<br/>

                            I'm not a fan of character death.  Like Vaxalon, I like to think of my characters keeping bees in Sussex.  I don't mind having my characters beaten, maimed, humiliated, whatever - but I don't like for them to die.<br/><br/>That said, there <i>are</i> two kinds of character death I can really get behind.<br/><br/>The first is the death that comes from the character's own story.  I want my character flaws to catch up with me in a very Greek-tragedy sense.  Whether the character is cruel, arrogant, thoughtless, lazy, whatever, that's what should get them in the end.  Their death should flow out of their inner nature.<br/><br/>The second is the no-good-reason tragedy, a character who has everything to live for but, well, doesn't get the chance.  I played a character once who, early in the game, promised her life to the gods for a chance to bring her lover back from the dead.  She spent the rest of the game <i>knowing</i> she was going to die, it was just a question of when the god in question was going to call her chips in.  Playing someone facing a heartbreaking doom was, well, heartbreaking for me too.<br/><br/>In my current long-term <i>Ars</i> game, I think we'll be playing my character all the way to her death, whenever that is.  I'm hoping for a deathbed-with-descendats-gathered scene, but as my GM is evil I suspect I'll get something very different (but highly satisfying nonetheless!).  So perhaps there'll be a third type of character death I discover I like, once we get there.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Len, i think i'm the exact opposite of you: i tend to remember the deaths of my characters more lastingly and with more detail than any other part of my games.<br/>
<br/>
However, this is probably mostly a symptom of the type of games i've played - the character's dying scene is the one with the most power in the game, whether it is a no-good-reason tradgedy or exaltation of the character's flaws, or the flaws within hir strengths.<br/>
<br/>
I guess i'm the type to let the situation develop, pushing for death when it seems most appropriate to me. Kinda macabre now that i say it... ;)                        </div>

                            In my early gaming years, most of my characters died by the dictate of the GMdice. This taught me to enjoy the story and be distanced to my characters.<br/>
<br/>
When I GM'ed I learnt I didn't like to be a dicetator, and tried to keep everyone's characters around so they weren't distracted by death and pc generation.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I think each PC will show their potential for bees or burying during the game. I hate to have some one keep my character alive for nothing that's in game, but I don't want them to die as well.<br/>
<br/>
One of my characters went to be a servant to the forces of magic once, which is quite bees-in-sussex-like. Others sit in long-forgotten folders waiting for sessions and wrap-ups that won't ever happen. Those are the character deaths I like the least.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to find one of my characters to live on in the songs and stories of the generations afterwards, wether they die or live.                        </div>

<p>Oh ... I just <strong>totally</strong> figured out how I want a character to end, someday.</p>
<p>I want there to be lively debate about whether the story of their death was actually true, or whether it was faked.  "No, man, they examined the dental records, that really was the Crimson Cowl," "Are you crazy?  He wouldn't have gotten himself killed like that ... My cousin's friends sister was rescued by the Cowl down in Nightshade just last month!"</p>
<p>And that's, honest to God, where I'd want to leave the story ... never having resolved whether the guy is alive or dead, but having made it <em>infinitely</em> clear that it <em>does not matter to the world</em>.  That the legend the person has made is such that neither death nor life can change it now.</p>

                            As an aside, this was a question asked of players at the beginning of character generation for 7th Sea.  I always thought it was kind of brilliant because, well, I love Dumas, and the death is as important as anything else for a Musketeer.  The answer was just some useful fodder for the GM - it gave him something to foreshadow and tease the player with, and it worked out pretty damn well.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I just want to end the character's story well.  If that's death, I want it to be an expression that death was preferable to letting some other thing come to pass, so that it's a final choice.  In a swashbuckling game it should have flare, and in a cyberpunk game, it should hardly matter at all, but it should end things.  I'm much more low key about it now as i discovered, as Tony has, that it's much harder to jump in front of lethal bolts 'o doom than movies might lead you to believe.<br/>
