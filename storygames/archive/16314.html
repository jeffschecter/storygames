It seems to me that requiring lords of their domains to act like adventurers "because D&amp;D" is the exact sort of preconditioning that one would wish to let go when playing an old school game that promises to be about more than just a string of combat encounters. Modern D&amp;D tells us that to play the game is to adventure, but the older forms are much more ambivalent on this, leaving it up to fictional positioning and player desire to determine whether a character participates in an adventure or not. Part of the method is, after all, to seek fictional challenges with open eyes. Why couldn't domain-level play work as a reason to play in itself, rather than being just a framing device while we're waiting for an excuse to go into a dungeon?<br/><br/>If I had a high-level character securely on the throne, I would totally leave him there and start a character stable of up-and-coming adventurers who <i>do</i> have that unfulfilled hunger for adventure and acclaim. My main man would just finance the expeditions and play favourites among my stable of low-level wannabes, and if the GM wanted to engage him, then it's up to the GM to think up some true-to-life reason for him to get off his keister. A war, perhaps, or some spiritual thing, an opportunity to appease a king's existential yearnings now that he has everything he ever needed. Or maybe he could fall in love, that makes a man do crazy things. The default state would be passive, though, and we wouldn't play the game with the presumption that this particular character <i>has</i> to be played right here and right now. A bit of patience and a willingness to play things loosely, and I'm sure that sooner or later the campaign would stumble on one of those classical elements of royal challenge, familiar from myths, legends and history: kings have plenty to do, after all, once you start to think about it.<br/><br/>What this kind of play looks like in practice is that it is specifically not mission-oriented, and specifically not GM-directed; domain play is not possible without a sandbox campaign structure. What you do is, you start a game session by simply talking about what the player characters have been up to. When the characters are homeless murder-hobos it's probably not very significant, but when they have on-going interests and political stakes going, then it's easy for this initial discussion phase of play to extend over an entire session as the players deal with all sorts of fictional events and conditions and preparations and consequences that are not adventures per se, but rather exploration of the condition of kings. Then at some point a proper adventure emerges and play starts to drill down through the strategic scales, until we've established who is adventuring, where, why, with what resources, and so on. Sometimes players specifically create new characters that fit the GM's adventure material, so as to get into a practical adventure from a seeming dead end. Sometimes what emerges is not an adventure at all in the low-level dungeoneering sense, but rather something that might be termed political or social struggle; I still don't have enough experience with this level of play to say what it is in detail - perhaps later.<br/><br/>In our campaign we don't have anybody on a throne, but we have had remarkably successful characters in financial and social terms. The trick has been that we play through the easy times and situations the character can avoid and pre-empt with his strategic resources on the strategic level, not wasting time on them. An adventure is only an adventure if a character needs to engage it on that level, otherwise it's just an anecdote or vignette, with perhaps a dice roll attached. We only go back to the full dungeoneering procedure once we've established that there are, indeed, player characters with a dungeoneering interest here. Sometimes a character is too successful for him to want to adventure anymore, at least not without clear and present danger to his own cozy life. We call this character retirement, and it's not the enemy the "I have to play this same character forever" guys paint it to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372542/#Comment_372542" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T10:46:28+00:00" title="April 12, 2012 10:46AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +2 bret                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372544/#Comment_372544" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T11:02:03+00:00" title="April 12, 2012 11:02AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the general idea is that, you become lord of a big tract of land or whatever, and your vassals are like, "Milord!

Right?<br/>\n<br/>\nFind threats that threaten PC stuff at the domain level. Bring these threats in both in the form of abstract happenings (Sir, they have taken castle Kriegerstein!) and in the form of various named, semi-believable NPCs (The Gold Queen has sent the drunkard messenger Claptrap to parley. Your advisor Fancybridges is about to have a heart attack!). Prep a faction/individual relationship map along with the geographical map you already have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get to the point where the PCs' domains cannot be feasibly challenged (bringing in outside threats is possible but is awkward), then yes, the game is more or less over - you can congratulate then on winning it, even. But if that happens the second that the PCs get a domain at all...

That is, there are a certain number of more important characters (diplomats, fighters, mages, etc) associated with the kingdom.

Each session revolves around some important event for a season, and different characters are going to be more or less suitable to deal with it.<br>\n<br>\nMy other feeling is that to make these games work well, the kingdom, not the characters, needs to be central to the game.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372835/#Comment_372835" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T08:57:43+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  8:57AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would look at Ars Magica.

In a game as slow-paced as the D&amp;D variants, I've rarely seen that sort of thing materialize.<br/><br/>Yeah, I've been looking at 'grand storytelling' elements such as this for my game in development. In it, the game world is the major focus of play, or rather creating/expanding it. So to facilitate this larger sweep, it will employ a 'grand storytelling' focus, with loosely coupled characters. Aria had a lot of this too, in creating entire nations, eternal lineages, and playing things out in 'Aria' time. etc.<br/><br/>This stuff could focus well into a Game of Thrones style cutthroat political maneuvering system, where loosely coupled character's is a good idea, since they are likely to get done badly. Or even a Dune style great houses fighting. <br/><br/>I believe more high level, shared authorial power with some enhanced methods of play would work well, what I am looking to build with my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373144/#Comment_373144" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T18:27:11+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  6:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In actual ACKS play at conventions: <br/>- people want to play high-level characters; the King rounds fill up the fastest<br/>- what they want to do with them is go into dungeons; options that might involve a monster-filled hole in the ground are universally chosen<br/>- having henchmen to send into dungeons, and lots of interesting-sounding-to-me things to do that involve domain management, do not alter this picture<br/><br/>I don't see this as a problem per se.
