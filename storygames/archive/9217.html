Some people like to define genre according to common thematic or dramatic elements. However, it's also perfectly valid to define genre simply according to color.<br/><br/>A classic example of this divide is <i>Star Wars</i>, which color-wise is totally SciFi, but thematically is closer to Fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203822/#Comment_203822" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T08:54:51+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  8:54AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2009 8:55AM by Doyce.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never have trouble explaining Magical Realism, as long as you don't mean the Literary Theory version of the label, which I think is hopelessly tied to specific time and place in the history of literature.<br/><br/>Explanation: "Read Neil Gaiman."<br/><br/>Longer explanation: "If you have something that book store people want to call Urban Fantasy, but it's not Urban, or really Fantasy (in the Tolkein sense of the word), just "weird" and "modern" day?

Unremitting horror simply won't fly in an RPG, because almost every player will reach their "that's enough now" point and disengage.<br/><br/>Horror is something you do for about five, maybe ten minutes at a time. Then you need to segue into something else, or the effect vanishes like mist and you've wasted your time. But if your timing <i>is</i> right, the impact of those 5-10 minutes will be much greater than a similar amount of time spent in parlour intrigues, or investigative magical realism, or whatever it is you use to cut your horror with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204045/#Comment_204045" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T02:47:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  2:47AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Slightly off-topic: I've heard Dread does a half-decent job of psychological horror, because the jenga tower facilitates the sense of building anticipation.</p>\n<p>Of course, if I were running such a game, it would probably still fall flat, as I don't have much of a real grasp on what makes horror work.

If you want to understand it, you can't read just the good ones, you've got to survey it, read the good, the bad and the parody. Read a range from the most chaste to the most explicit. It's best to randomly pick books for a while, just survey the genre. Be persistent. Some books write for those already familiar with the genre, playing humorously on people's knowledge of the cliches, much like gamers often do with high fantasy, so you may feel like an outsider for a bit.<br/><br/>Jane Austen - it all starts here, but pick a book other than Emma to start.<br/>Danielle Steel - Don't start here, either.<br/>Nora Roberts - about the biggest name today, but avoid her romantic suspense (sometimes published under J.D. Robb)<br/><br/>Really Intelligent Romance - doesn't get released under "Romance," it gets released as "Literature" because the romance genre has such a bad reputation. I'm told by those who have been reading longer than I that Julie Garwood is about as smart as romance gets before it has to switch to literature.<br/><br/>Paranormal romance and romantic suspense may look like a way to ease into it, but beware. They work completely different from most romance, much more like a rpg, with characters defined by what they are, not who they are, and resolving their problems with violence and superpowers, not romance. I'd argue many of them are not romances at all, but not-so-good urban fantasies or thrillers with some lust thrown on as decoration.<br/><br/>If you want to understand the genre, you've got to get into the historical (including regency, highlander, etc.) and cliche stories (including businessman, pregnancy, soldier, cowboy, etc.). <br/><br/>I've noticed that non-Harlequins tend to vary more in character design but be very formulaic in plot structure (no-yes-no-no-yes-no-yes), while Harlequins tend to be very stereotypical in character design, but slightly less so in plot structure. Both can use the formulas/stereotypes sometimes, so you have to read a few before you can really spot the variations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204098/#Comment_204098" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T06:48:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  6:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like there are a couple of different ways people are looking at this issue.<br/><br/>1) Genres that are hard to explain/define to anybody (i.e. a "general audience").  (Or genres whose redeeming features are often overlooked by these audiences - i.e. Romance novels, so-called "torture porn".)<br/><br/>2) Genres that role-players have a hard time grasping (non-D&amp;D fantasy).<br/><br/>3)Common traps role-players fall into when thinking about genres (focusing on trappings rather than the genre's "core").<br/><br/>3) Genres that haven't  been emulated/expressed that well in role-playing games (Jonathan Walton's point about fight stories).<br/><br/>4) Genres that seem underrepresented in role-playing games.  Like, where are the "Midlife Crisis" games?<br/><br/>Matt Snyder talked about the difficulty of explaining the genre of <i>Nine Worlds</i>: that difficulty seems to me to be case <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  If the fiction from the <i>Nine Worlds</i> games I've played in were turned into a novel, there would be no question that it would be a Fantasy novel.  But in RPG-land the label "Fantasy" tends to mean "like D&amp;D", so all those other kinds of fantasy get pushed to the side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204133/#Comment_204133" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T08:51:43+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  8:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a big difference between gamers playing an RPG in-genre and genre authors.<br/><br/>Gamers celebrate, showcase and build mechanics around the tropes of a genre; we use them as handholds and anchors and aren't afraid to hammer them in.  (Actually, almost every genre-based mechanic in a story game is an example of a constraint, but that's for another post.)<br/><br/>Authors--with the possible exception of romance or pulp novelists--are constantly striving <i>not to write within genre.</i>  They want their books to be considered crossovers into "real literature;" they struggle to avoid tropes, because, well, indulging in clich\xe9d developments is Bad Writing 101, and they know they'll get made fun of.  Open any genre mass-market paperback with a few pages of blurbs at the front and you'll find at least one saying that "[This book] is an achievement not just as [genre], but as <i>literature.</i>"<br/><br/>Most story games emulate the improv-style method of creating story off the cuff.  Trope mechanics make that a lot easier and more fun.  Shock: is pretty much the only game on the market that actually tries to model the process of writing a story (though I suspect Hydra will cover other aspects of that process), because writing is more difficult, slower, and less fun to do with other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204146/#Comment_204146" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T09:14:46+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  9:14AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the top:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>In another one of the Story Games patented "point-counterpoint" threads, what genres that need substantial explanation?<br/></blockquote>\nTranshumanism.

Never before have I heard of a Cthulhu game where the PCs so eagerly jumped into the death spiral and embraced both sanity-draining implanted tech and mind-destroying sorcery, barely staying alive by burning through their SAN, POW, and MP at a rate normally reserved for cultists.  One PC performed the Unspeakable Oath in the penultimate session, pledging himself to Hastur (win!); another, cybered-up in just the right way to be an awesome magic user, used a spell which trades permanent POW for temporary MP so much that she burned herself down from 17 POW (a promising sorcerer) to 2 POW (can't win a game of Candyland). The only character that came out of the experience with any sanity left was the dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks, cyborged-up thug, and that because he was too stupid to understand what was happening around him (and even to him).

I have been thinking about this for many hours now. My initial response was "Oh jesus how could someone be so embarrassingly wrong about something so obvious".  That has softened. I can understand how someone could be so wrong about this and it is not embarrassing or obvious, because this thread and perhaps we in our own hearts are smushing the word "genre" around.<br/><br/>A couple of thoughts.<br/><br/>I - Games Where Genre Is On You<br/><br/>D&amp;D was never intended to be a genre piece. It was originally a wargame bolt-on, for god's sake.  What D&amp;D did with genre was use it to enhance the experience of the game.  An evil vizier? A giant snake? Well, okay, that's something you'd see a lot in a sword and sorcery novel, but does that mean a module including those things is trying to tell that kind of story? Not at all.  Usually they are pulling elements from those familiar places to take advantage of that familiarity.  You know what an evil vizier is like! Fighting giant snakes is cool!  And so on.<br/><br/>D&amp;D gives you a broad range of sword and sorcery elements (as well as a lot of other elements, some Tolkeiniieieanean, some Moorcockian, blah blah blah) to pick and choose from in creating your story and that is why I've always said it's a strong story game, because play groups have a really evocative toolbox in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Genre is a tool too, but D&amp;D functions at a different level. I can do a pretty decent sword and sorcery game with (some editions of) D&amp;D, and I can do a pretty decent fantasy espionage and fourth-wall-breaking game with (some editions of) D&amp;D.  In order to get a decent genre story, if that is what I desire, D&amp;D assumes I know something about the genre, or more broadly and more accurately, <i>D&amp;D expects you to know what you want.</i>  This is one reason it has been so successful.  Groups that want different things can go into that toolbox and pull out different things.  Or if one group wants one thing today and changes their mind tomorrow, or in an hour from now, they can do that too.  Sometimes you can pile the pieces up in the shape of a genre story and go to town with that, but it's all on you and your own understanding.  If you don't know what you want, you won't get what it is you want, whether it is a genre story or not.<br/><br/>I've called D&amp;D and games like this "story games" before because that's how I and my group play them.  But there's no question that they provide a different and very very basic set of tools for the game than something like Call of Cthulhu or Feng Shui.  I think this is where the "traditional games are stupid about genre, stupid stupid stupid!" feeling comes from. Well, yes, they are stupid about it, but that doesn't mean genre isn't useful to those games and doesn't mean that those games haven't successfully been used for genre pieces in the past.  <br/><br/>You can play D&amp;D without ever giving a shit about genre but I think the DMing discussions that go back way back to the Dragon letters column show that many, if not most, groups, had some concept of what they were aiming for story-wise, hashing out sticky wickets like what "heroism" means and whether Greek heroes or Howard's heroes were what they were looking for.  <br/><br/>What they didn't do, and maybe they and I were stupid about it, was that we didn't turn to actual people who studied literature and wrote about it to figure out what it was that we were after and what the pieces were.  I must have run twenty mystery-based games before I read my first book about mystery novels and how to analyze them and various views on them.  Somehow I didn't think this was strange, somehow I thought that just because I'd read a bunch of mystery novels that I knew something about them, and I did, but it wasn't analytical, it didn't break them down into pieces where I could use them in a game.  In this respect the hobby remains far behind, broken down in a ditch while literary analysis zooms on ahead in a cool looking car.  <br/><br/>But frankly plenty of modern hippie "story games" are just as much guilty of this as the old busted down old man games that I play are.  Primetime Adventures does virtually nothing with the structure of a TV show except recite it.  Universalis is exactly like D&amp;D except with a universal toolchest rather than a fantasy-specific one - you build your genre when playing and designing the game.  With Great Power and Dust Devils are the only two I can think of right off the bat that laser in on genre (a subgenre, in both cases!) and build around it. <br/><br/>(PS from thread above: Nine Worlds doesn't depict a genre story, or if it does belong to a genre, it's a genre so broad that identifying it doesn't tell you anything about the story or help you in any way. Genre is just a tool. Not everything in the world is helpfully analyzed through the lens of genre. Nine Worlds is not. That is not a bad thing or a good thing about Nine Worlds!)<br/><br/>More soon...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204185/#Comment_204185" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T11:23:24+00:00" title="April 29, 2009 11:23AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, JD broke the thread.<br/><br/>I think we're going to flounder uselessly until we can identify what it is that we intend when we're talking about genre. Because I'm fairly sure that what JD's talking about as genre isn't what I understand the term to mean (because you the kind of tossed salad approach he's talking about is antithetical to it), and I <i>think</i> the Paul/Jesse "genre" is actually a third thing that I wouldn't necessarily include under genre either - the Wikipedia article linked to is certainly a pretty pathetic swipe at the topic.<br/><br/>Genre occurs at the <b>intersection</b> of "bits" (tropes, stock characters/situations, color, etc), structure, themes, and .... cultural position. (Ick. Bad phrase for what I mean. But whatever.)<br/><br/>I get what JD's saying about the use of <b>genre trappings</b> by gamers not being inherently "stupid". But it <b>is</b> "stupid" with respect to the recognition and recapitulation of genre. Because the genre is not JUST the bits. You can't mix rockets &amp; rayguns &amp; bumpy-head-aliens and automagically get space opera. Which is usually about as far as RPG attention to genre goes. We woefully neglect the role of narrative structure, presentation, medium, and <b>cultural situation</b>.<br/><br/>This is how you end up with "D&amp;D fantasy" coalescing into its own recognizable Thing (genre?) out of the attempt to reproduce literary/mythic/pulp fantasy all at once, and in a medium fundamentally different from their origin. You can take the tropes out of their source medium, but you can't put them back together again in a meaningful way <b>without</b> that source medium. They're irrevocably altered by the cafeteria selection and structural transformations.<br/><br/>Then again, that might be a feature and not a bug. At least some of the impetus toward RPG play seems to be to deliberately break the color of genre away from the conventions of genre - to play it "not stupid", or "realistic", or "gritty", or ...heh... "original." For at least a portion of the RPG audience, genre is probably an obstacle to playing with the toys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204191/#Comment_204191" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T11:42:39+00:00" title="April 29, 2009 11:42AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Genre occurs at the<b>intersection</b>of "bits" (tropes, stock characters/situations, color, etc), structure, themes, and .... cultural position.

Regardless of trappings (space ships, stagecoaches, magic carpets, etc.) the basic themes remain the same.  Characters tend to have the same personalities and operate under the same rules.  I often see the phrase "things that make for good literature do not make for good RPGs" posted as a counterpoint to those advocating stronger narrative elements in games.  I think, at least partially, this is a form of genre-reinforcement:  RPGs work like <i>this</i>.  <br/><br/>As a working example I present "RPG Pulp" as opposed to actual Pulp.  "RPG Pulp" assumes Nazi Gorillas in Zeppelins, whereas actual Pulp spans a much broader range.  Heck, one finds very little mention of "Nazis" in traditional pulp stories, because they were written before the NSDAP gained infamy in WWII.

I certainly know that one of the appeals of gaming is exactly the freedom to mashup elements across genres, although I personally prefer to keep a strong aesthetic center - my "space western" is intentionally still a Western in structure and themes, just with different color.<br/><br/>I suspect that "RPG Pulp" has more to do with gleeful ignorance of the actual Pulp era - as with many things, the gamer imagination in this genre is more concerned with Hollywood pulp, so you get Indiana Jones + The Lost World + comic book retrofuture. It <b>is</b> its own genre, mislabeled as "pulp" - but the RPG world isn't actually the source of the mislabeling. I lay that squarely in the lap of popular culture.
