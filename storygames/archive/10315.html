One poster commented that if one of the characters dies, the game ends for everyone because it's that character driven. I remember not particularly liking my characters dying when I started playing AD&amp;D, and with the way it was set up you spent a long time waiting to get a new character to fit into the story. So I had the question, "If PC death ends the game, why play a game where PCs can die?" and applied it to myself as well, and I'm not sure why I do that.<br/><br/>If you find PC death to be really disruptive, and you play a game in which your PCs can die, why do you keep playing that game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229305/#Comment_229305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:57:41+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because sometimes playing against a punishment with teeth can be a hell of a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229306/#Comment_229306" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:58:07+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the subject of my first Forge post.

After being bored the next 2 hours doing nothing, they asked if everyone could go somewhere else to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think the potential for death is thrilling and makes the game feel risky and dangerous. Which can be a lot of fun. Depending on the game. But where it's not appropriate, the people playing should allow people to make new characters or NPCs. If the game is super character focused, that makes the death even more thrilling. It's meaningful and will affect everything and everyone. Nothing will be the same. That's great fuel for new situations. And the appearance of new characters. Unless the GM has a pre-written plot.

They kitted me up in skull makeup and set me loose on the town. It took MANY other character to finally take it/me out. Similarly, I was--well, allowed myself to be--totally killed out in a OWOD game; I MAYBE could have survived, but I'd done what I wanted with the character and was ready for new experiences. The organizer allowed me, however, to play an Archon sent to investigate why someone other than the Prince was responsible for the final death of a member of the Camarilla. For those who don't know: Archon = very, very scary for every PC in the game.<br><br>* It adds frisson: I've played plenty of LARPs with resurrection, and death merely becomes an inconvenience. A nuisance that takes you out of the action while you wait (and was a resource drain, because the healers all charged to do it, the fucking cartel-monkies!). Then I started playing a game with a "death pull": a bag of glass beads; many white, one red (bad consequence of death), one green (lucky bonus from death), and several black; pull a black one and you die; whatever else you pull never goes back into the bag. Thus, you WILL eventually die; and knowing that made every little encounter--not to mention major field battles--much more nerve-wracking and tension-filled.<br/><br/>* It makes "real" enemies: I was killed by another, much-higher-level player for basically expecting her to be fair with group XP and Gold distribution for a major encounter. She threatened; I said, "You must be joking" to her death threats; she (and her four clansmates) surrounded me and beat me down while I stood there yelling, "MURDER! HELP!" I died, was dragged off to be looted, and left to rot. Fortunately, another player noticed (heard?) my plight and found me, dragging me to get resurrected. In THIS system, though, you only get something like seven resses before you perma-die, and you are not supposed to recall anything from about thirty minutes before you die. BUT... someone else stepped forward, when I was "blundering" about trying to figure out where the past hour had gone... and narced on the killer. In-game, she was tried and sentenced to TWO deaths (kill, res, kill, res), leaving her PC with, maybe, 2 left. I just smiled beatifically and asked if she knew where my sword was (answer: in her loot chest in her cabin; in-game props were property of the game and, thereby, any PC who claimed/stole them). For a LONG time after that, she spent considerable time trying to get me somewhere alone, to re-kill me and (hopefully) have me dissipate (if not ressed within, like, 10 minutes of death, you dissipated and perma-died). She HATED me... for what SHE had done, capriciously, and failed to get away with. I LOVED it, because I had a "real" enemy, in-game, not some cardboard NPC/monster to avoid.<br/>...But come to think of it, that would only happen with always-pera-death if you came back in as an avenging family member or similar. Any "revenge fantasies" against the player would be VERY poor form and probably result in a suspension or ban.<br/><br/>TLDR summary: I will only play in LARPs which have a real risk of death (even though the rules I wrote do have several options and toggles for resurrection). Anything else robs the game/sport of its risk/reward balance, which seems to inevitably lead to very jaded, disinterested players over time ("The *Yawn*-Here-Comes-Another-Great-Old-One Syndrome").                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229334/#Comment_229334" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:37:57+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:37PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem isn't the character dying, it's the character dying <em>at the wrong time</em>.<br/><br/>I try not to play games where the characters die at the wrong time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229337/#Comment_229337" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:41:09+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>The problem isn't the character dying, it's the character dying<em>at the wrong time</em>.<br/><br/>I try not to play games where the characters die at the wrong time.</blockquote>This is a good call.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229341/#Comment_229341" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:47:58+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree--it might suit narrative games, but not simulation or gamism. Sometimes, it's not the VC that get you, it's the mosquitoes... and there is a theme there, if you look for it. 90% of all Airsoft or paintball LARPs use a "pure" perma-death system, and sometimes it's just dumb luck (or firendly fire!) that brings an end to a trooper.<br/><br/>But that said... yes, in my own LARP rules the primary toggle is Player Priority or World Priority. In the former, you can only die if you Commit (regaining full Health and Natural Armor) and then are knocked down to 0 Health again before 15 - your Psyche minutes go by. The whole point of that system is to let the player decide when something is important enough (i.e. when is "the right time") to risk it all. It's elegant, and I thank Walt Freitag for providing the inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229350/#Comment_229350" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:57:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>The problem isn't the character dying, it's the character dying<em>at the wrong time</em>.<br/><br/>I try not to play games where the characters die at the wrong time.</blockquote>\nI agree. I've had a few character deaths which turned out all right.<br/><br/>One time I was playing D&amp;D with a party of 1st and 2nd level characters. The DM loved the Tarrasque and dropped it on us (or rather miles away from us), and we went tracking it. Found a portal undergound it had come out of. We experimented with sticking things through. I mentioned I'd go through if someone else did. Another player went through, and the DM was planning on waiting to see what happens on our side, and the fire alarm went off. He ended up describing the scene on the other side, and I knew my character would fully die, no chance of avoiding it. So I metagamed a bit, experimented with sticking stuff through the portal, and ended up figuring out it was one way, so I set up something where I could go through and write about what happened with a stick partway through. Ended up dying but recovered some really useful information for the rest of the party. That was cool, but there also weren't any rolls for death. It just happened.<br/><br/>Another time a character got killed in the Great Modron March (trampled to death by Modrons), so I played a Rogue Modron after that, who thought he wasn't rogue and all the other Modrons had gone rogue. The death there gave me an opportunity to play another character right off the bat, and it was a pretty cool character concept, so I was happy with it.<br/><br/>More often though, deaths have been in situations where there isn't anybody else, so I was just bored and couldn't do shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229374/#Comment_229374" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T14:51:11+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  2:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's break this question down:<br/><br/><b>IF</b> I find PC death to be really disruptive...<br/><br/><i>(I don't all the time, but okay, yes, sometimes I do, this particular group I'm playing with especially...)</i><br/><br/><b>AND</b> I play a game in which your PCs can die...<br/><br/><i>(Okay, I'm not sure why I would, given the first "if", but I'll entertain the notion...)</i><br/><br/><b> THEN</b> why do you keep playing that game?<br/><br/>Broken down like this, the question pretty much answers itself:<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't, but if I did, it would be because the possibility of disruptive PC death was small enough that I was willing to risk the disruption in order to gain the benefit of some other part of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229384/#Comment_229384" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:21:01+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:21PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 3:29PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>In high school I knew 2 people who quit RPGs after their first game because they were sold that they were going to play out this awesome adventure but their character ended up dead in the first hour and then they were bored for the next 5.<br/><br/>It was especially hilarious because one of the people who's character died was the person who was hosting the game. After being bored the next 2 hours doing nothing, they asked if everyone could go somewhere else to play.</blockquote>\nOh, god, this totally describes high school AD&amp;D for me.<br/><br/>What still baffles me is that there me and my friends were, and we <i>knew</i> that this sucked, that it was completely uncool and shitty to show up to play and end up sitting on the sidelines for hours making a new character (and maybe even hours more waiting for "the right time to join the party").  No one liked it.  No one thought it made the game more fun.  No one defended it -- when someone's PC went down for the count, we all empathized with the player and said "That totally blows, dude."  Even the GM would be upset that one of us was out of the game.<br/><br/>But we never did anything about it!  For fuck's sake, we even waved around the argument that "AD&amp;D makes resurrections too easy -- in OUR game, it's REALLY HARD to get raised from the dead!" even though the difficulty and rarity of resurrections <i>was making the problem worse.</i>  It boggles the mind.<br/><br/>Honestly, whenever I read an article that says that people's brains aren't fully developed until they're in their twenties, I look back at those campaigns in our various basements and think, "No shit."<br/><br/><br/>Now, obviously, there are ways that character death can work well in a game.  But strangely, when I think about it, those ways are not the first things that come to mind.  No, in my head it's all about spending Saturday night sitting on a crappy folding chair, watching other people playing, clutching the brand-new character in my hand and wondering just when the fuck I'm going to be able to get back in.  (Which is probably why I still believe in my heart that the entire concept of character death as a consequence of failure or as a stake in a conflict is a billion times less interesting than just about any other consequence or stake you could mention.  That whole area lives in a place beyond rational argument for me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229386/#Comment_229386" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:26:59+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really the only rational reason to play a game in which PC death ends the game is to play a game in which not dying = the victory condition.

I really hate having to sit sidelined or to crunch a bunch of numbers for a new character while others are fully engaging with the fiction. I value my fun-time too much, and roleplaying is a lousy spectator sport anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy benchmark game in this respect is <i>Zombie Cinema</i> where being dead doesn't really make the session any less fun. Sure, you don't have a protagonist to advocate for, but you can still frame scenes the same as always and participate in conflicts by giving away your dice. You also get to play supporting characters and zombies a whole lot more, and that's rewarding in a slightly different way. Although the game has no set game master role, in the instances I've played the players that lose their characters early tend to gain more ownership in these areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dynamic actually reminds me of the versions of tag or dodgeball where the people who are caught or hit simply change sides and immediately continue the game in a new role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229577/#Comment_229577" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T08:30:16+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  8:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br><b>IF</b>I find PC death to be really disruptive...<br><br><i>(I don't all the time, but okay, yes, sometimes I do, this particular group I'm playing with especially...)</i><br><br><b>AND</b>I play a game in which your PCs can die...<br><br><i>(Okay, I'm not sure why I would, given the first "if", but I'll entertain the notion...)</i><br><br><b>THEN</b>why do you keep playing that game?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nSo, to keep it more practical, what do you do (or what does the player do) when you're running a nWoD game (vampire, etc) and one of the PCs dies in a combat at the beginning of the game? Do they sit out the rest of the session?<br><br/>I agree with your question, but think there might be some ways around it. Like, the element of "when you die": If your character dies towards the end of the scenario (within 30 minutes of the end), then I don't think many folks will have a huge issue with that. Hell, I don't even mind going out like a total punk (ref. "Tomb of Horrors; Pit trap with spikes on the bottom, where the spikes are covered in poison and the pit is full of acid"), as long as I have something to do for the next 2-3 hours while my friends continue to play.<br/><br/>Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium has a solution to this. Your first death in a scenario is a freebie: If you die, here's what happens:<br/><br/>1) Your hitpoints immediately refill to max.<br/>2) Your pool of Awesome Points (not really called that, but they let you do awesome things) is *doubled*.<br/><br/>However, before the end of the scenario, /you have to die/. If the scenario ends and you are still standing, you keel over right then and there. <br/><br/>In play, this tends to mean that the characters who "died once" will go out on a total blaze of glory: Crash a tanker of gasoline into a demon while riding it like a surfboard, then shooting the tank under them with an uzi, etc.<br/><br/>However, it's certainly not appropriate for all games. And yet, I'm thinking that I'd definitely want some sort of similar-but-different mechanic for games like Vampire where, if a PC dies, it simply means that they're going to die this session, not that they're taken out of the game and the player is sitting on their hands. Or going back to the books to make up a character alone in the corner for 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Some ideas (for a Vampire game, as it's what's on my mind):<br/>1) If you "die", you've taken some kind of mortal injury. You'll die by the end of the session. You will not be able to succeed at any task you accomplish, but you can still roleplay and interact, and determine when you die.<br/>2) If you "die", you're fucking dead. But the GM must bring you in to play as major NPCs for the rest of the session.<br/>3) If you "die", it's just like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but you get to automatically succeed at one- and only one- task. If you don't spend it by the end of the session, you die and you lose it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229605/#Comment_229605" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T09:46:15+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  9:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I think I see the rub, and it's not "gee, I love My Guy."

Death is disruptive, and thus it is a motivator.<br/><br/>Death is not disruptive to the session, death is disruptive to the fun. So you do what need to be done in order not to die. This can motivate your PC to forge alliances, to seek power, or it can motivate the player to engage with the tactical (mini-)games in order to ensure their character's longetivity. Which is a part of what the game is about.<br/><br/>Show me meaningless death and I'll show you that it's all about perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229650/#Comment_229650" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T12:34:10+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>Otherwise we're all mucking about playing Little League soccer where every match ends in a tie and everyone gets ice cream and puppies afterwards.</blockquote>\nKittens fit in the ice-cream bowls better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229657/#Comment_229657" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T12:49:43+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:49PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:49PM by lachek.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>The question is "If PC death does not end the game, then are you playing a game at all?"<br/><br/>Games require loss states. Otherwise we're all mucking about playing Little League soccer where every match ends in a tie and everyone gets ice cream and puppies afterwards.</blockquote>\nWhy must PC death be the loss state? And, in fact, why must the end of the game be a loss state?<br/><br/>In soccer, the end of the game doesn't signal a loss state - it signals a loss state for one team and a win state for the other. In fact, for a given agenda, there may be a win/win state or a loss/loss state, if the agenda was "play a good game".<br/><br/>In most RPGs I'm familiar with, the overarching agenda is "play a good game", with the sub-agendas of "where 'good' is defined as positive outcomes of Step On Up, Story Now, or Right To Dream". Even in Step On Up play, a good game is defined as <i>everyone</i> bringing their A-game, not as one team dying horribly against a vastly superior force.<br/><br/>In one particular Dust Devils game, I'm convinced my character "won" at the moment of his death - wherein he won a contest with another PC and managed to, in his own mind, detonate a nuke to sink California into the Pacific. In fact, he merely died from an infected head wound while tripping on a <i>lot</i> of acid. This was all authored by me, as I'd fought hard for narration rights. It was his time to die. It was a win, not a loss.<br/><br/>I've played in games which never ended, and which I'd consider a net loss.<br/>I've played in games which ended quickly, even pre-maturely, and still consider them a win.<br/>I've played in games where my PC has died and still considered it a win.<br/>I've played in games where my PC survived and considered it a loss.<br/><br/>I think the terms are conflated, and in order to discuss this properly we must discard notions of connectedness between "winning", "continuing to play", and "surviving". They are only true in a narrow range of RPGs available in the market, and even then not consistently true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229675/#Comment_229675" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:34:38+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree. However the original question was "why play a system that allows PC death to end the game?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is, because in those games death is a loss state and that's a valid way to end the game - and by that I do not mean end the campaign, I mean that particular game instance. When I played Old school D&amp;D (red box) or AD&amp;D, we would regularly have characters die, which indicated a "loss" for that particular character instance. The player would create a new character and bring him in when it was convenient. It was the arcade equivalent of dropping a new quarter in the machine when Pac-Man gets et up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn games like that (not all games - the ones where that's traditionally been an issue) I personally find the idea that one single character MUST live throughout an entire years-long campaign an oddity. If there's no viable threat of death in a game that involves combat and danger then there's no real threat. And thus, in my opinion, something of the "game" element is missing from those games. Much of the fun has traditionally come from the sense that you might fail, your character might die. It was never the end of the world; it was an end of a character, and that character's game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou bowl a bad game, it doesn't mean the bowling alley shuts down. It means you lose, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery game does it differently of course:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn HELLAS, death is neither win nor loss; it's an expected state and it can be either, both or neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Ninja Burger, death is a loss; you fail to deliver, you die.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the point is, why play a system that allows it? Because "ending the game" does not mean you can't continue playing the game; just that instance of the game. If the PCs do something dumb and get wiped out by a dragon, you can either:<br/>\n<br/>\na) say "awww there there the dragon didn't really kill you, you're all at 1 hit point and here are some free magic swords"<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\nb) let them die, roll new characters, and try again. Drop some more quarters in the slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf neither of those sounds appealing, one can also:<br/>\n<br/>\nc) avoid dangerous situations altogether to ensure that players never die<br/>\n<br/>\nor <br/>\n<br/>\nd) fudge dice rolls all to hell to pretend that they're not going to die<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all of those, only b sounds appealing to me, in situations where character death is and should be a possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo tangent here for a moment, I think the issue is that somewhere along the line a mental switch got thrown for RPG gaming in general. It went from:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Extreme: Roll 3d6, in order, make a character appropriate to those stats, play that character, when he dies start over with a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nto<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Extreme: Create the perfect character; pick his class and race, give him uber skills and stats so he is a perfect manifestation of everything you ever hoped for, and then play that single character forever and ever and ever and ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm happy somewhere in the middle, but frankly, I'd rather have my guy die than wander through dungeons like I had noclip on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229687/#Comment_229687" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T14:07:03+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  2:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Mike brings up a point:<br/><br/>Make Death Expected, and in fact make it Awesome.

One poster commented that if one of the characters dies, the game ends for everyone because it's that character driven. </blockquote>\nWell, that poster has a very unusual position, representative of nothing beyond their own tastes.  In most old school games, if a character dies the game continues and the player who lost a character rolls up a new one.  I've literally never heard of an old school game ending for everyone because a character died.  Whatever that poster may think, I don't think that's a remotely typical old school view of gaming.<br/><br/>Most assume continuation after a TPK.  Everyone rolls up new characters, play continues, unless by coiincidence everyone's a bit bored anyway in which case you play something else.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>If you find PC death to be really disruptive, and you play a game in which your PCs can die, why do you keep playing that game?</blockquote>\nEither because you're an idiot or because your group doesn't agree with you on how disruptive it is or finds it less so than you do and you want for other reasons to remain in the group.  I can't see much other reason.<br/><br/>But really, it's not rocket science.  If character death can occur casually and easily, it shouldn't stop play.  It certainly shouldn't end the game for all players, really not even for one.<br/><br/>If character death is a lose condition, it should ideally only arise from bad play.  That's a challenge issue, it's not how I play but it works for some.  There, death shouldn't really be random (though note, some games where death appears random have different assumptions as to player behaviour, like indie games if you lose your assumptions going in and play as intended it's not how it looks at first blush at all - see early D&amp;D for an example, much less random than is often thought if played in the manner originally intended).<br/><br/>If character death is only appropriate in the given game or genre where it's dramatic, the rules should support that.  See Buffy or almost any indie game.  Obviously there chargen can be more involved, you're expecting after all the character to stick around awhile.<br/><br/>If character death is wholly out of genre or not something players are interested in, obviously the game should avoid the possibility of character death without player consent.  <br/><br/>If players want character death to occur when it feels that in the real world it would occur, then either the game should focus on activities unlikely to lead to dead characters or chargen should be quick or both.  This tends to be where I like to play.  I often play games where character death is on paper very easy, but characters in play therefore avoid situations that put them at risk.  Again, there's sometimes an assumption that easy death on paper leads to easy death in play, but like the song says it ain't necessarily so.  You need to look at the context in which those rules are applied.<br/><br/>Again, it's not rocket science.  If characters are expected to die a lot, getting a new character should be easy.  If not, chargen can be more involved.<br/><br/>As for what we do in my group.  If we're playing a game where characters can die, and mostly we are, if your character dies you either roll up a new one or if that would be disruptive you play an NPC until there's a convenient moment to make up a new character.  Character death in practice is rare, but it happens and that's how we deal with it.  The idea of the game stopping, for everyone or just for that player, it's absurd.  It's a game, we're there to enjoy it, the death of a character leads to a change in play but not a cessation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229781/#Comment_229781" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T07:39:36+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  7:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character death can be a great tool in games to keep players in check also. It adds meaningful consequences to the game that make the characters feel attached to their characters. As an example I ran a Scion game (to bad the system mucks such a cool concept up) and the group at the start of things were trying to track down a group of rouge Scions hunting down prominent members of the catholic church. Their big worry was the retaliation of \u201cThe Saints\u201d (the catholic pantheon), so they made a list of people that were targets and decided to \u201crescue\u201d them. <br/>\n  The characters approached the priest late at night trying to get into the church telling the man that his life was in danger and they wanted to help them. When he told them he was going to call the policy they decided meh were gods we can handle this, and kicked the door in. Little did they know that he was also a scion who called some lackeys to try and clean the players up. They overpowered him and ran away leaving the sneaky character behind by himself to look for clues. Shortly after 3 vans full of men with guns show up at the church filter in, and thinking himself to powerful for mortals to contend with the player promptly attacked them instead of sneaking away. Within a round or two they had pulped him, and the experience (unintentionally) put the characters in their place. <br/>\n  For the remainder of the games run time I would have to say the characters were more conservative than any of the other games we have run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229792/#Comment_229792" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T08:06:54+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  8:06AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2009 8:09AM by Marco.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>If you find PC death to be really disruptive, and you play a game in which your PCs can die, why do you keep playing that game?</blockquote>\nThere are a few reasons (a lot of this has been covered above to one degree or another. NOTE: I am using 'disruptive' as a term for 'it stops the game.' If it simply means someone is really bored for a while there are other ways to deal with that):<br/><br/>1. Lots of games have potential unpleasant end-states so mechanical death is just one of many. For example, a Forge AP of DitV ends with one player feeling emotionally brutalized. I presume <br/> they didn't play that game again if they ever did repair the friendship at all. Our Sorcerer game culminated in a battle no one was interested in playing out (we would have won, it would have taken time). The mechanics don't prevent these events either but we continue to use the systems despite those risks for obvious reasons (their benefits) compared to the risks (the chance of hitting these end-states is low).<br/><br/>If your goal is to play a game without a disruptive end-state then something as open-ended as roleplaying is probably going to be ill-suited.<br/><br/>2. Threat of death is congruent with lots of fiction. Almost all fiction--especially action/adventure--involves fear of death from an immersed perspective. In some of that fiction, people actually die, unexpectedly (see No Country for Old Men). It's not uncommon to celebrate that even though it is unpleasant and disruptive much of the time (The cool-guy dying in Scream 2 effectively ended the movie for me--I no longer cared. On the other hand, in NCfOM, I was shocked and dismayed. Once I recovered, I was electrified. It actually took me several days to realize what an achievement it was). As such, we can have an unwanted, disruptive condition that <i>may</i> end the game--and it can paradoxically still be highly valuable to the experience.<br/><br/>If you remove threat of death you may be limiting the maximal appeal of the game along the criteria of judgment of the fiction.<br/><br/>3. It seems that for many people immersion is a key goal of play and simulation-like mechanics assist greatly in that. For those players threat-of-death is a required element and is highly conducive to immersion.<br/><br/>For a lot of people (it seems to me) threat-of-death is a required part of the experience, even if it can lead to disruption.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229934/#Comment_229934" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T19:23:16+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  7:23PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>There, death shouldn't really be random (though note, some games where death appears random have different assumptions as to player behaviour, like indie games if you lose your assumptions going in and play as intended it's not how it looks at first blush at all - see early D&amp;D for an example, much less random than is often thought if played in the manner originally intended).<br/></blockquote>\nI would really like to hear more about this!<br/><br/>And, unless it's been covered here already during the time I've been away (the last four months or so), I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Prior to my indie days, I played with a group of hardcore gamists, and somebody's character would die, like, every single session.<br/><br/>However, I do think there is a flaw in "traditional games" (<i>and I'm using that term very stereotypically in a way that won't map to all old school designs</i>): The problem isn't with the possibility of death, per se, the problem is that PC death is ALWAYS what's at stake. 99% of the time, it's "if I win you die, and if you win I die". There's very, very little middle ground. Individual groups might work out ways to establish non-lethal stakes, but that's an individual add-on, not anything inherent to the design.<br/><br/>That's what forces the need for hacks and GM intervention, not to mention defensive/turtling player tactics. I think a lot of problems would be solved if more games used an approach like Dogs, where damage and death are byproducts of conflicts, but not the primary meter of success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
