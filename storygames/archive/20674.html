Now the d20 is a symbol for 'gamer' and the concepts of Class and Level are commonly associated with the hobby. Hack and slash. Kill things and take their stuff. Murderhobo. Minmax. All cultural conceps which emerged from D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Vampire did this accidentally by being a perfect fit for an <i>existing</i> culture (Goth). It has waned in popularity in step with it, and at this point may be all that remains of it.<br/><br/>The Forge had a culture which valued game design. But because of that no single game which emerged from there became a cultural foundation, as Forge culture was literally antithetical to it.<br/><br/>Fate and Apocalypse World are the most popular 'Indie' systems, and each of them has recognizable traits and values which form a their own cultural group.<br/><br/>And I know it's a cultural (particularly value) thing because RPGs are the only game hobby where people take offense to a game designer telling them <i>how to play the game they designed</i> and new game concepts are treated as some kind of <i>attack</i>. It's about values, not systems.<br/><br/>This is relevant to the question of how to manage online RPG communities (which I have been investigating) and why the 'Indie' industry missed the mark. It all comes down to culture.<br/><br/>And that's why I'm not marketing my game to current game cultures. They're already established, and I'd spend as much effort tearing down what already exists as I would building up what I want to see.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453903/#Comment_453903" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T19:55:59+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  7:55PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've thought the same thing.

I agree with him on the point: there is a pecuniary interest in encouraging consumerist attitudes and dependence on marketable products. Considering how anti-consumerist the entire idea of roleplaying is ("Hey, let's play a game where everything happens in your imagination, and we make up all the particulars!"), it is quite wondrous how very much the reality manages to be a thing of new releases and top-down marching orders.<br/><br/>(What would a non-commercialized, maturing rpg culture look like? I suspect that it would be something more along the lines of say the martial arts hobby, where books are secondary to practice and instruction, and the participants view themselves as people on a journey rather than consumers of chosen product lines.)<br/><br/>Which is, of course, not to say that the opposite does not exist as well. This very post is an expression of the opposite value set, and it's not like I'm somehow being original here. Furthermore, of course aspiration has scored great victories over finance here and there - just look at the Forge, and all of us crazy hobbyist puttering on as a consequence <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453923/#Comment_453923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T04:57:36+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  4:57AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Furthermore, of course aspiration has scored great victories over finance here and there [...]</blockquote>\nI suppose D&amp;D (in its original format) would be somewhat the ultimate example of this!<br/><br/>Sure, it got commercialized later, but I'm guessing that wasn't on anyone's mind at the game's beginnings.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453934/#Comment_453934" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T14:33:51+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  2:33PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Forge was all about commercial aspiration.

Same can go for things like effects pedals (some are built for say a grunge sound while others for a more metal sound). The marketing often reflects this (brands like Ibanez and schecter often are marketed toward metal guitarists). That said you can certainly use an Ibanez in any style of music you want to play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454033/#Comment_454033" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T14:29:06+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  2:29PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah...

The product is great; what you need to do is make it more accesible. You must think of the worst case scenario of course, that you're selling it to people who:<br/><br/>-Doesn't read too much or doesn't want to read too much to play.<br/>-Isn't familiar with other systems, techniques or procedures from any roleplaying game.<br/>-Will definitely feel cheated if you explain that they will need more than one book from your collection or some hard to find props to play (like d20 dice in my country).<br/>-Definitely don't want to deal with too much math nor complicate game mechanics.<br/>-Doesn't have too much time to invest in this hobby (YET, perhaps once you get them interested they will make some sime)<br/><br/>And at the same time, to people who do, which is easy if you put some more optional rules. So you need streamlined or minimalistic mechanics, quite well explained. You need to convey a lot of info in the least space possible -for which I believe comics are the best: a lot of the techniques are more easily explained through visual AP examples. You need to make prep really short, fun and an integral part of the session, so the DM doesn't have to spend time out of the session and people can start playing right away. You need to keep the amount of mechanics to the minimum possible and recycle them to solve anything that could come up in the game.<br/><br/>For the rest, the actual culture is already there. You can perfectly sell this as a formalized way of "play pretend" and every single person in the globe will get what you mean, everything else, they will acquire it through playing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454048/#Comment_454048" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T16:48:18+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  4:48PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I took JD's comment to mean something like " If it looks like those AD&amp;D hardbacks, it'll surely sell like those AD&amp;D hardbacks!!!"</blockquote>\nAbsolutely - but 2097 is correct too because distribution does have a lot to do with this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454051/#Comment_454051" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T16:54:12+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  4:54PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading an old issue of Sinkadus earlier today and they were responding to a letter that said "You do so much box sets with booklets, please switch over to big books" and they responded "It's because our distribution chain is toy stores, they don't carry books as our competitor bitterly learned when they tried to publish <i>Wastelands</i> as a book".<br/><br/>A couple of years later, they were kicked out of the toy stores (probably trying to sell Kult 1e [which was kinda more brutal than 2e and 3e] in toystores was a dumb idea) and they switched to books too, which I could never find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454054/#Comment_454054" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T17:02:42+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  5:02PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Why teenagers of course <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>After assisting several 'Gaming and 'Anime' conventions I've found that the latter just don't find current RPGs engaging enough (or they don't know about Monsterhearts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ), and the former are somewhat dismissive of the latter and any format other than 300+ page book.

Since people isn't way too familiarized with authors nor the value of the content, most people value publications by their lenght and size. If I sell a softcover 36 page comic book at $2, readers still not engaged with the story will find it too expensive. They will buy it for a quarter, though. However they can be fooled into paying $2 for a 48 page sofcover comic with glued instead of stapled cover. It's like, they think it's reasonable for the value to go up that much just because it looks like it has more pages.<br/><br/>But then, nowadays people value much more the time they take finding stuff, so everyone prefers to go only once to the store/event and spending as much as they need to get a complete collection, instead of going once a month to get the new part and then wait another month to get the next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454077/#Comment_454077" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T19:05:45+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  7:05PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a publisher, I can say that the marketing challenge is totally doable.

A nice package of procedures and interactive bits to use whenever you feel like it might be a more natural fit for the typical adult's sense of "play" (as opposed to flipping through a book for the "right" answer).<br/><br/>The complicated ruleset may reach fewer people, but for the people who it <i>does</i> reach, it at least provides a compelling incentive to purchase, being further away from what you could just do on your own (e.g. with a few simple pointers of the sort you can find for free online).<br/><br/>And yeah, a lot of adults seem very self-conscious about playing pretend with other adults.  I'm not sure what a product can do to reframe that, other than to claim that its activity is something <i>else</i>, and then slip the playing pretend in, like in the How to Host a Murder Mystery dinner party games (which don't actually require any roleplaying, but make it fairly natural to do at least a little).

We've got one more in production, but it's more geared for people already familiar with RPGs, as it's a design from a friend of mine. As for the two we were selling, the first one was meant to test the anime-fan community and system in general. I used a franchise that hasn't been licensed in my country, so I didn't print more than 20 ashcans. <br/><br/>The second book was "OFFLINE" an improved version of the system that could use any player-made setting and gave guidelines for making them in less than 30 minutes along with the characters. I'm still selling it as an ashcan for the moment as I'm further improving and simplifying the system. Distribution is actually our biggest issue as we ain't got enough manpower/spare time to take care of it by ourselves, and all big distribution companies here in my country are totally corrupted and often mafia-like, so it's really hard to get money back from them (believe me, we tried). <br/><br/>I'm thinking now of another couple approaches, one is to print a 1000 to 5000 run and give it away for free at schools and conventions, the other is to make a webcomic based on the game an sell it as merchandising or give it away for free at the website. I'm kinda okey at giving it for free because I don't need the money right now and I prefer to see people here in my country have healthier entertainment habits (local tv is plain garbage up to an unbearable point for me and it has way too much rating despite that, specially from underage people that shouldn't be seeing shows like those anyway.)<br/><br/>So well, I can't really back me up with numbers here; however I've got both roleplayers and nebies enjoy the game quite a lot at cons (tabletop game cons for that, as there aren't RPG cons here at all, neither trad nor indie) and I'm quite proud of having parents over 50 years old, totally unfamiliar with RPGs or similar games, enjoy a session or two with their children.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454087/#Comment_454087" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T20:05:57+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  8:05PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome!

Each couple is split up, and each matched with someone from another couple. The conceit is that, at the end of several episodes, every player will announce whether he or she wishes to stick with his original romantic partner, or "upgrade" to the person with whom he or she was paired during the show.<br/><br/>The game uses several techniques common to jeepforms, including "inside outsides" (character monologs), presaging and post-saging (other players seizing the action and playing out either a past event for one of the characters or a potential future event, with the main player of the character then required to modify his or her conception ofthe character accordingly), etc. It is played in "episodes," beginning with the producers and participants talking about "tonight's show" and what "the audience" is about to see, then improvising events that were filmed and presented to the broadcast audience.<br/><br/>As is typical with jeepforms, it places a strong premium on eager improvisational roleplay, with the "producers" shaping the experience but not with as much authority as conventional GMs, and can result in much hilarity.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454152/#Comment_454152" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T04:18:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  4:18AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like we agree on several observations.

How would you explain the game to the masses? Considering that these masses don't have much time to play your game, how would you design it? How would you explain it's mechanics and techniques?<br/><br/>If you want to make it lucrative, then there are a lot of models you can use: give the core for free and sell the modules, sell everything on a single book, encourage the creation of a community around something else and then throw the game over as merchandising, etc. You can make distribution yourself on physical if you've got the time or through digital means and then invest that time knocking doors everywhere to make it known, etc. <br/><br/>You need a product easy to understand and use for everyone and there are lots of ways to do this, some that will even be interesting for veteran players.

Lonely fun is an aspect of RPGs that hasn't been explored enough yet, and as such it's a totally valid entrypoint into the hobby. <br/><br/>Maybe a design that allowed you to experience the RPG thrill safely on your own but still allowing you to increase or decrease the number of players at any point of the game without ruining anybody's fun. Also an easy way to graduate the complexity of the game up to the players tastes.<br/><br/>The complex part is still to avoid the Czege principle while using a low amount of props, and keeping versatility and replayability. So far we got cool 2 player games and sort of boardgames with a variable amount of parts in the shape of cards, counters, boards, etc. as well as several randomizers to keep things fun for a while. <br/><br/>The Pathfinder board game sorta does a good job, but it uses tons of card components and keeps their model around selling the core of the game and adventures separately.<br/>You can actually make your own cards and print them for play, but I myself doubt I'd end up making a whole adventure to play by my own, it still looks as way too much work, and I've got a group of players I can roleplay with. I'd also have yet to see anybody who played the PF gameboard by themselves first, convinced their friends of playing it and later got everyone into roleplaying Pathfinder.

You know, just like fly fishing, car restoration, scrap-booking, geo-caching, and so on.<br/><br/>For folks who might end up becoming voluntary recruits, they now have an "in".

We were talking about lonely fun helping with accessibility and stickiness.  Clearly whatever fanfic and fanart is currently supporting RPG interest is, y'know, not sufficient to take the hobby (or any particular game that I'm aware of) beyond its current level of niche interest.  In theory, a game or culture that better rewarded such lonely fun could do better on that front.  <i>That's</i> what I don't see happening outside of X-Men and Jedi and the like.  How do you better motivate the creation and sharing of fiction or art about some characters you made up that no one else has ever heard of?<br/><br/>Okay, having asked that rhetorically, I now have a little bit of a brainstorm: spin-offs.  If I write some fiction about knights and noble houses and struggles for power, I'm probably going to get a lot more inspiration and feedback if I set it in Westeros as opposed to a setting I made up myself.  But if we rule out Westeros and the like, maybe some gamer-generated body of quality entertainment is the next best thing.  Something like the Living Campaigns D&amp;D has supported at times, but optimized for integrating player / GM world-building and creation of interlocking stories.  <br/><br/>So, something like, if one game group created House Stark and who they were and wrote up some Jon and Arya stories, and vaguely mentioned the Lannisters as the rich, cutthroat southern power... and then another group created House Lannister and wrote up some Tyrion and Jaime stories, and incidentally mentioned the Iron Islands... and then the next group says hey, maybe the heir to the Iron Islands has been a prisoner of House Stark until just recently, and let's do a story about him now, without being beholden to what some central authority like George R. R. Martin had in mind...  <br/><br/>I wonder...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454310/#Comment_454310" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-28T19:26:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2016  7:26PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think there's any "lonely fun" involved in board games,</blockquote>\nThere is quite a bit.

Thing is RPGs have become such effective lonely fun (bought to read) that fewer people want to play them, but that hasn't stopped people from sharing them with others of like mind.<br/><br/>So one of the cultural values has to be that games are meant to be <i>played</i>, and for online RP groups discussion <i>is</i> play.<br/><br/>Let's also consider intersections. For example, is the Star Wars RPG more popular among 'gamers' or 'Star Wars fans'? For that matter, is <i>any</i> licensed RPG more popular among gamers than fans of the property?

I mean, they are games, they're meant to be <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">played</span></i>, right?<br/><br/>Lots of the ones I love have things that can only really be done as a group. Chargen, setting and situation generation, all kinds of mechanics for doing that as a group, making something really unique to that specific group of players.

Visuals are important. RPGs have always been a little odd in that there tends to be very little to show. Once you can show ( visual) stuff, it's easier to connect with people outside of the hobby.

That might be a good step in the right direction. ( Actually, I don't see it much in any games, but I can think of a few indie games specifically meant for 1 on 1 play. They also tend away from the sort of action-adventure play that is one of the hallmarks of mainstream games.)<br/><br/>Mind you, it isn't about 1 on 1 being superdoubleplus awesome. It's simply easier to get one other person to play a game than a group when you're starting out or when you happen to think about some quick pick up gaming. Mainstream, action-adventure games are almost never set up to handle the situation or fail to even discuss the possibility.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454638/#Comment_454638" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T13:11:15+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  1:11PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For example, being able to engage RPGs through reading, writing, and discussion gives people something to do when unable to play, but I don't want that to become the primary way people engage them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454641/#Comment_454641" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T14:59:04+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  2:59PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, okay, were in agreement there I guess.<br/><br/>Is this a big concern?<br/><br/>My only point was that Indie RPGs ( again the ones I specifically like) tend to not have a huge amount to do if you're not playing them, as opposed to mainstream RPGs that do tend to have a higher potential for lonely fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454645/#Comment_454645" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T16:33:56+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  4:33PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't help but notice that the smaller-press games which have caught on the most have a shareable DIY component to them.<br/><br/>In the OSR, people share dungeon modules and random tables, and other similar things which are *required* prep for play. This creates a community where people are interested in each others' <i>stuff</i>.<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> encourages people to a) use the same names in their game as their neighbour, and b) to write up hacks and playbooks to share with each other.<br/><br/><i>Fiasco</i> has people everywhere writing up "playsets" and sharing them.<br/><br/><i>IaWA</i> oracles were pretty popular for a while, too.<br/><br/>I initially saw playbooks and playsets as a limiting factor - why do I have to create new books and sets  just to play this game? There are lots of games where I don't need to create anything before playing (I don't character templates for Primetime Adventures, right? Just an idea to bring to the table).<br/><br/>But I suspect it may have to do something with the popularity and the community aspect of a game, when you can share house rules and prep materials. Making and sharing them gets you to daydream about play and to talk to other people about their own daydreams.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454653/#Comment_454653" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T17:38:42+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  5:38PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco playsets would be a really interesting thing to look at.

No one's going to go online to search for "my little pony" and accidentally stumble on play materials for Primetime Adventures, to use a dumb example.<br/><br/>Take all this with a grain of salt: I'm just aimlessly wondering!

Which was a novel concept to us having only played D&amp;D and pathfinder. We liked AW stuff because it aligns organically with our play preferences, or at the very least is light enough to stay out of our way. But yeah we had already played D&amp;D, the only people I know whose first RPG was an Apocalypse world hack are new gamers who I've introduced to the game. <br/><br/>Now that I have a system I am excited about do I get to play it more often? Not really. Being a good at delivering what you want doesn't matter if no one will pick it up. So what gets played? Cards against humanity. I am so sick of that game but people love to play it. Now maybe its a stretch from RPG's to that game but I think its an important note.<br/><br/>How much can you change the RPG to make it something people play often and still call it an RPG? Maybe RPG's are on a spectrum with accessibly on one end and depth of play on the other and there is no way to cheat your way into having both.<br/><br/>I think to some extent the natural state of games will always have some gateway games and more dedicated hobbyist games, even if the details change from generation to generation. It will always be hard to get people to try new things, it will always be hard to get people coming back to to the table ever xday night.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454732/#Comment_454732" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T08:10:10+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  8:10AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Cards against humanity.

Maybe RPG's are on a spectrum with accessibly on one end and depth of play on the other and there is no way to cheat your way into having both.</blockquote>\nTwo aspects that I think many roleplaying gamers forget is time and replayability. I don't have any numbers but games, that has a winning condition, and that is played around a half hour will be played again. To play again gives the others a chance to win, but I think the main reason is that the game ends before people have gotten bored with it. I played lots of shorter, and boring, games again, only to see if I missed something or if I can learn some new aspects of the game.<br/><br/>And here comes replayability. Games like Carcassone and Settlers of Catan has huge replayability because of how the mechanics works. Roleplaying games focus, in my mind, too much on creating a specific adventure and hoping things will come out of that, instead of focusing on a certain <i>aspect of joy</i> (ex. winning, expressing oneself, bullying someone, discover through play, experience through play) and then have a <i>structure of play</i> (which adventure writing basically is one part of) that creates that joy.<br/><br/>Right now, we have usually a game master that has a roleplaying game with tools to create whatever adventure. That person makes something up, and put the players' characters into that, and something will perhaps come out of it that matches everyone's expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20674/designing-cultures-vs-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20674/designing-cultures-vs-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20674/designing-cultures-vs-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20674%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20674%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
