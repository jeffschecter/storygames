I've been wanting to run it for a while now, and I finally got around to it last night. It was *epic*. I thought I'd share the experience and some of the rules/procedure tweaks we used.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b></span><br/><br/><b>Before Play:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to give us a little more to go on right off the bat without answering the big questions completely. All my players had played Microscope previously, so I stole some techniques from that game. Everyone gave a one sentence pitch for what the game should be about, with the limitation that it couldn't contradict the starting situation. Then we collaborated to morph our ideas together. We decided our game was about a group of rogue hackers exiled to the Ghost World by the Cyber-Oligarchy for political crimes, and also that the world was post-apocalyptic.</li><li>We also made a palette, though we had relatively few adds and bans; traditional ghosts were banned, and "reality hacking" was added.</li><li>I introduced a new move, which was a blatant port of refreshment scenes from Lady Blackbird: when you take a break from the action, you might have a flashback or share a quiet scene with another character that reveals something about your relationships, your past, or your powers. All players in the scene: instead of rolling, take a bonus die.</li><li>I had the players create a custom move for their crew member; they were all really excited about this, and we had some awesome setting and character defining  ideas come out through this. .COIL's player created a move that went something like this: When you wraith-walk, you can establish a connection with or possess a wraith. Danger: the connection goes both ways.</li><li>Finally, I added one thing to the list of questions to answer as we go. We had four players, and so one crew member went unselected. The question was, what happened to .HULL? It ended up driving the whole game.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>During Play:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Play started slowly; I told the players they were empowered to make up whatever they wanted into the setting, but it took some prompting to get them to do this. To draw them out, I spent the first scene putting each of them on the spot individually to answer a specific question about the game world. The custom moves helped with this; for instance, .GRIP's player established that his custom move was related to special "wraith-ammo" he used. I asked him about the last time he fought Dogs, and we established some really cool stuff about the wraiths and his character history at the same time.</li><li>The first couple scenes took a while to play out, but we established a whole mess of fictional stuff. Stones were liquid information on the real world that the prisoners were after; they collected said info through temporary info pillars, which tended to be guarded by wraiths, for mysterious reasons. The Ghost World itself was a sort of parallel reality which looked exactly like post-Apocalyptic earth, except where its reality had been hacked by the inhabitants. After some running around in the underbelly of the Ghost World, the players found out they'd been caught in a conspiracy by the Oligarchy, which was trying to destroy information that proved they were responsible for the bio-weapons that caused the apocalyptic events in the real world decades ago.</li><li>By the middle of the game, everyone was comfortable jumping in and making up fiction on the fly; I barely had to prompt them at all. People used the flashback move to great effect to flesh out their relationships to .HULL. They decided, over the course of several scenes, that .HULL had been an expert wraith-walker who had gone too far and been assimilated by the Spiders. Before she left for good, .HULL gave them a cryptic message that the Spiders had told her about a green world...</li><li>The whole thing came to an awesome slam-bang conclusion at the Night Carnival, which was both the biggest Spider nest, and the biggest concentration of info pillars in the Ghost World. It was a race against time as the crew tried to get the proof to indict the Oligarchy while Spiders and enemy agents beared down on them. Things were looking grim; .VIXEN was identity-hacked by the Oligarch .NIX as she tried to stop the agents, .COIL was possessed by a Spider, and the others were in grave danger. That's when we interrupted the action to have a quiet scene where .COIL was contacted through the Spiders by .HULL's consciousness. She showed .COIL the green world, before the apocalypse; he agreed to die and join him in the green world, in exchange for the info that would indict the Oligarchy, and the knowledge of how to open a portal to the real world for her comrades. .GRIP sacrificed himself to hold off the agents as .VIXEN downloaded the info and escaped through the portal.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Final Thoughts:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>This game kicked ass.</li><li>Asking questions and putting people on the spot early is key. My role as GM at the beginning was to generate interesting questions and distribute them evenly. The custom moves really helped here, because they gave me a sign as to what aspects of the world each player was interested in defining.</li><li>Occasionally though, my role as GM was also to make a hard move and add info into the story. When the players stopped to ask each other "what's next" and couldn't answer fast enough, I interjected with something like "you all know that the only place to get this information is the Oligarchy HQ at Grand Central...". I also occasionally prompted a flashback by asking a hard question: ".COIL once vowed never to return to the Night Carnival. Why?"</li><li>Stealing elements of other games worked out very nicely; the Microscope method let us get on the same page but left plenty of room to add more and flesh out our answers to the Big Questions. The refreshment scenes also gave players a nice way to establish more info about the world as we went along.</li><li>The players LOVED custom moves. At least half of all moves made were custom. At first I was concerned by that, but they were having such an great time with it that I didn't feel the need to change it.<br/></li>\n</ul>\nSeriously, this game kicked ass.

Because of the more open-ended nature of G/E moves, it was faster and easier for players to add new functions to their existing custom moves. The thing is, making a custom move mid-game requires stopping the flow of the game for a second to think about it, write it down, and explain it to everyone else. The players may have felt they needed more explicit rules permission to do this. If I ran the game again, I would change the refreshment move to something like this:<br/><br/>When you take a break from the action, you might have a flashback or share a quiet scene with another character that reveals something about you relationships, your past, or your powers. Instead of rolling, take a bonus die OR create a new custom move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366553/#Comment_366553" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T10:22:02+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 10:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating.

A couple differences I noticed:\n<ul>\n<li>G/E doesn't have much by way of built-in social moves (like you get from the Hardholder, Hocus, or Chopper). G/E moves tilt the game towards a more action-oriented experience.</li><li>Related to the first point, G/E moves encourage a push-your-luck approach that goes hand in hand with the focus on action. Players added lots of extra dangers and got themselves pretty banged up.</li><li>G/E doesn't have a lot by way of inter-character mechanics compared to AW, but the refreshment move did a good job of building those relationships, which was neat.</li><li>G/E moves are more open ended than AW moves, and as a result they require that you keep establishing new things about the world on the fly to justify/explain them. The players were playing their characters and creating the setting at the same time, which was neat.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>Also, how did you represent different levels of competence or advantages? Was it by adding dice or by tuning the scope of risks and success on the spot, based on your perception of the fictional characters and context?</blockquote>\nWe heavily used the latter technique. When a player wanted to establish that their character was especially good at something, they set a particularly ambitious goal. When I wanted to make an action especially difficult, I added a particularly nasty danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366580/#Comment_366580" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T12:12:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 12:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't yet, definitely check out Psi*Run.
