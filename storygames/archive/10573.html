Signing up!  Might as well get back to the Burning basics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the panels, it's tough to say.  They all sound really interesting, but the last one, being the most general, might attract the most particpants.  I know they've got Burning stuff on sale at Valet hear and there is at least one group that played Burning Wheel in the past year in Montreal, but we're a pretty scattered scene here.     We've had mixed results with panels.  Last year there weren't many and they weren't too well-attended, but the year before they were quite crowded.  The slate this year, looks really interesting, so I suspect there will be a decent audience.  It would help if the designers coming up were to spread the word on their own social networks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a selfish perspective, I'd be all over the PA fiction panel.  I didn't know that was one of your areas of interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237930/#Comment_237930" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T21:48:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  9:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the Indie hipster invasion of Montreal is off the ground.  I was fortunate enough to bully my way into an impromptu intro session to Mouse Guard that was really enjoyable.  Got to meet Robert, Vincent, Luke and Joshua in the flesh and throw some dice.  It will be a nice foundation for my first Burning Wheel game tomorrow, which immediately follows my first 4e game!  Then I'm capping the night with my own session of Mutant Future.  I have no idea how the two games preceding are going to influence how I approach the running of MF, but I suspect they will.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the con overall, it's modest, but I was really happy to see that all the games were full, many of which had only one or two pre-regs, which means there are a lot of non pre-registered gamers looking to fill seats.  It bodes well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't deal with getting a good recorder, so my podcasting recording won't be fulfilling my ambitions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237933/#Comment_237933" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T22:41:25+00:00" title="October 16, 2009 10:41PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was great to meet you, sir.

I caught the second and I'm going to be an asshole here and say that I am kind of angered at the two guys who were actually deep into designing games (deep enough to be having playtests with observers at the con) who bailed on the game design seminar because <i>they were hungry</i>.  Grab a fucking sandwich and come back!  Lame.  I've heard podcasts of these sessions and they are really rigorous.  I'm not sure if I'm in agreement on some of the philosophical assumptions behind them and I don't like the "tough" style of discourse, but the end result is effective and if you aren't willing to take advantage of these designers rare presence in town, then you are missing a major opportunity to improve your game.  Plus, I wanted to see it live!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it was, we had a pretty interesting discussion about what is kit-bashing and what is designing and actual game.  Really interesting and the hour seemed about 20 minutes long.  I really loved Luke's metaphor about the currency system in D&amp;D; being this beautiful, elaborate, baroque clockwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraconis is a bit humble and we've gone through some difficult times and face some struggles still, so we really appreciate you guys making the effort to come up.  It seems like you had a good time and you definitely got some people interested in your games.  I think we can do more to make visits like yours way more effective, both for you and for the community.  But just your coming was like a giant shot of gaming adrenaline in the neck.  So thanks to Luke, Robert, Vincent and Joshua from all of us in Montreal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested in some more in-depth and varied discussion about the con, both at the organization and gameplay levels, we are getting quite into it over at the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.midnightslair.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=15" rel="nofollow">general Roleplaying sub-forum on Midnight's Lair</a>:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238212/#Comment_238212" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T15:41:57+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  3:41PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, I wish to exten my thanks^personally to all of our very special guests Luke Crane, Robert Bohl, Vincent Baker and Joshua A.C.

It was indeed quite lame of the designers of the Creative System to leave before the design panel.

Since our random encouter at Le Valet, I ended up spending the week-end with you and I truly had a great time. You sure boosted my passion for the hobby. Special thanks to Luke and Vincent with whom I had the chance to share some madness and laughter and as for Josh and Rob, I enjoyed your company and only wish next time the schedule will give me the opportunity to play with you.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I raise my hat to all those who made Draconis possible. It was my first real con and at first, I was thinking of running only one game then spend the week-end home, but I ended up being there the whole time and playing in 5 slots ! It also made it possible to meet new people that I would totally like to play with in the near future. As far as I'm concerned, these are the main goals of a convention : make people play and meet other players. In my case, it is mission accomplished. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, thanks to Jumanji83. Not only do I like gaming with you, but you were the one who made me sign up and I'm very grateful for this.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238242/#Comment_238242" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T19:30:24+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  7:30PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WalkerP : from what I understand, it's a fantasy heartbreaker.
