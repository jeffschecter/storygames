                    This is riding right on the coattails of the Mindshare discussion.<br/><br/>I'd say that "the counter is reset for indie games" at 2004.  Before that was such a turbulent time that so many bizarre factors worked in selling these games that it's hard to pinpoint central causes.  But since then, the whole Self Publish scene has taken off and become organized enough through various venues that  I think we can put our fingers on various factors contriduting to sales and the like.<br/><br/>So... I'm wondering, are there any "steps" you can take or "conventions" you can adopt into practice that can turn Your New Game into a game with sales up to <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or <i>Truth and Justice</i> levels?<br/><br/>Also, does the actual subject matter of the game assist in sales?                </div>

                            Huh. Here's a thing: I never heard of Truth and Justice until this thread. So that tells me that I'm missing out on a whole bunch of webspace where that game's being talked up, and maybe the author of that game oughta be hitting the places where I go.<br/>
<br/>
My advice to the would-be publisher is get your game played by people who know how to talk about what happened when they played. My sales aren't too different from Dogs', and I attribute that to good AP reports. Capsule reviews on RPGnet are sucky in comparison. I mean, what motivates you more: a) You can draw some cards based on your stat, or b) I experienced something fun and new when I played this game?<br/>
<br/>
So find someone with some cred that you think would like your game's style, and ask them if they'd be willing to play it.                        </div>

                            I was thinking about this exact topic yesterday. I've been observing the various indie games and trying to isolate which bits of their strategy (planned or unplanned) help to build up to a solid set of sales and recognition. Partially as I'm hoping to do something similar with <a href="http://www.realms.org.uk/covenant/" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a>.<br/><br/>From what I've seen over the last few years. From observation, I think these are the key factors:<br/><br/>-Grabby premise. If it can't be explained, and sound cool, in two sentences, then it's not grabby enough. More to the point if you can't do this on demand when asked about it, then people will pick up on it. You should have one memorable and unique mechanic too.<br/><br/>-Get the game played lots: a) By playtesters b) At Con demos c)by people who have gaming blogs d)by active forum posters<br/><br/>- Post early and often about your game on forums, well before it's out of playtest. Particularly indie game design. Jump on anything vaguely relevant on the Forge or rpg.net, answer the posting, have your game in your sig, only tag some promo on if it's really relevant.<br/><br/>- Get some enthusiastic people onboard with the playtest. They'll sell the game for you by their enthusiasm. These people will generally confirm what you say in the threads mentioned above, and advertise your work for you. Since they're perceived as more neutral, people are more receptive.<br/><br/>-Get actual play mentioned as often as possible.<br/><br/>-Get in with vocal people who have a similar interest. Support each-others games.<br/><br/>-Reviews only help if they come from people with a rep, or they obviously played the game, or if they are the first thing that turns up on google when somebody searches for Game X Review. If you have all 3 it might do half the job of an AP thread.<br/><br/>-Flamewars are good for business. But be calm, and seen as talking sense when somebody rants about your material. <br/><br/>Anybody with more self-publishing experience want to confirm or deny the usefulness of these?<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

I don't think subject matter/topic is as all-powerful as the industry and customer base has been thinking it's been for the past few years. It's a factor, but obviously not the most important one. <br/><br/>Frankly, DitV is a weird setting/concept and T&amp;J is a pretty common genre. You can't say that oddness or familiarity are the primary drivers attracting interest to these games. <br/><br/>Then, push stuff out -- announcements, freebies, playtest copies, demos, review copies, mailling lists, etc. -- early on.  <br/><br/>At some point (say, within the first month of release of the product), ease off, make yourself available for comments, and wait for pull/customer interest to rise -- otherwise, you could alienate the customer base. <br/><br/>Resist the urge to constantly keep pimping, but you can interject small, short reminders (say, one per week).<br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Matt Wilson said:<br/><i>Huh.

I see your point. It has to be done well, and not in a ramming it down their throat way. A tricky balancing act. About the delays thing, I think Weapons of the Gods did a good line in handling this. Having an open playtest also lessens the effects of a dely in the final version.

I was largely basing this off both Luke and Vincent's anecdotes about sales boosts when any big flamewar happened about their games. Largely because some guy ranting about what your game ISN'T also tells others what it IS. Same with negative reviews, in a way.<br/><br/>And thanks for your insights, it's given me another set of angles to mull over.<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

                            Another thing to consider, from a business standpoint, is that having multiple games increases your overall sales for a given product. People come in for one product and then get interested in the other. Or at least that's what I'm told.                        </div>

                            "You play mormon inquisitors in a West that never was."<br/><br/>Is this a grabby premise?  Cause personally, this was the last thing that attracted me to the game.  Did anyone here read what the premise of Dogs was and think, "God damn, I've been looking for a game that combined polygamy and righteous indignation for years!  Where do I buy this product?!?"  I don't think a grabby premise was a factor in Dogs' success.  In fact, I find increasingly that the <em>content of play</em> is of hardly any importance at all; it's <em>how that content is played</em> that matters.<br/><br/>Look at Exalted.  Do people buy into this game because you get technicolor armor and a giant sword?  Nah, people buy into this game because you're a <em>total badass</em> that happens to have said armor and sword.  It's the actual play (I'm thinking stunting, specifically) that people buy for.  That the book cover accurately portrays the game play described inside is a nice complement, but not the prime mover of sales.<br/><br/>It's not <em>premise</em>, it's <em>play</em>.                        </div>

                            Andy, I don't think it can be any one thing that leads to the better sales of one game over another.  A lot you can't control, like name recognition, as in Clinton gets a lot of name recognition, as does folks like Ron.  <br/>
<br/>
However, you can control your community presence, like Luke does over at NERDNYC and cons as well as on forums.  He has cultivated over time a solid base to rely upon.<br/>
<br/>
Like Tim said, mutliple games or multiple books for a game help too.  It is the reason I have suddenly become the retail darling over at IPR.  I sell more that way then directly over the last quarter.<br/>

                            Well, I think Vincent's success is due to two things: his constant and friendly presence in relevant communities, and the quality of his game.<br/>
<br/>
Luke's done a lot of legwork selling BW. He's at cons constantly, his book is <i>gorgeous</i>, and he maintains an avid online community.<br/>
<br/>
... so you can be sure, when they release something, his fans know, and they want the objects of their fandom to keep producing stuff, and they spread the word.<br/>
<br/>
It seems pretty obvious:<br/>
<br/>
Have a good game.<br/>
Make it look good, unique, and attractive to your audience.<br/>

                            One thing that people sometimes overlook about Vincent's success:<br>
<br>
The Quality of His Writing.<br>
<br>
Like, no shit, that dude can write some prose and you'll understand every word of it THE FIRST TIME you read it.  More than that, you'll actually remember the most important idea of every paragraph because he pounds it into your head, makes sure you have it, and then still makes sure to remind you of it later on.  Dogs is a great game to play, yes.  But that book also contains some of the best RPG writing currently available anywhere.  <br>
<br>
And, unlike almost every game on the market (including most other indie RPGs), the book ACTUALLY TELLS YOU HOW TO PLAY THE GAME, it doesn't make you figure it out on your own through practice or by thinking about it a lot.  It says, "if you want to do X, you should start by doing, Y, and then Z, and then eventually you'll get to X, see?  Here, let me draw you a diagram..."<br>
<br>
Vincent isn't trying to sell you a product.  He's a mentor trying to show you how much fun you can have playing.  And that's why he succeeds, because he's not really trying to.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'd think that Dogs made it on the quality of its play and yes, that is absolutely linked to its writing.  Indie games, more than other games, are beholden to their play; I think they tend to value play more and word of mouth sales are very much a post-play affair.                        </div>

                            Jonathan said:<code>One thing that people sometimes overlook about Vincent's success:<br/><br/>The Quality of His Writing.</code><br/>...and I totally agree. There are some really great games out there with texts that read like heinous technical manuals. I've got one in front of me that I <em>know</em> plays well, I <em>know</em> is interesting, I <em>want</em> to learn, but I <strong>dread</strong> reading because it's difficult and boring.<br/><br/>I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy that game, because they'll be put off playing it by the game text. I can recommend (and do) that they <em>play it first</em>, and then pick up the text.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I showed Dogs to my boyfriend's (really, really, non-gamer, concert pianist, professor) mother, and she lapped it up - skipping the dice mechanics.                        </div>

<br/>
And, in regards to the topic of this thread, as Luke so ably demonstrates, never underestimate relentless self-promotion. I really do think actual play helps a lot, and it's also good to personally meet other game designers and get them playing your game and talking about it before it gets published. The Forge is a great place for this.                        </div>

                            Isn't "taking off" a relative concept? <br/>
<br/>
I have DitV, but I haven't gotten around to reading or playing it yet. I have no plans to purchase Truth and Justice -- isn't that the PDQ supers game? <br/>
<br/>
I bought DitV and KPfS+CS on the merits of Otherkind. In fact, I told Vincent that I was paying him for Otherkind -- he just happened to be giving me DitV and KPfS for free. :) I liked the  Otherkind so much that I very subtly (and subconsciously) incorporated one of its key concepts into my own publication. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't know how actual sales of DitV have gone. What does "taking off" mean? Breaking even? Turning a profit? Some other ROI calculation? <br/>
<br/>
I had the good fortune to find someone who thought my ideas were good enough to invest in and publish, as opposed to having to do everything myself. I had external validation from the get go. And it's still tough to see the game taking off even though every armchair review has rated it very favorably. <br/>
<br/>
I've incentivized truthful Actual Play reviews with cash payments, but I've had no takers yet. When I've run demos, I've sold plenty of copies. Apparently, the game gets great response after actual play -- nearly everyone wants it. This isn't just my experience, but the experience of multiple game demonstrators, on multiple continents. <br/>
<br/>
I was never naive enough to think I was going to get rich from this. I already have a steady job that I completely enjoy. More importantly, however, I wasn't naive enough to think that a solid game design would be enough to get my game noticed. All a solid game design does is validate a buyer's decision to purchase. If the validation happens before they purchase, that makes no difference. A good game design does not provide the impetus to purchase a game. <br/>
<br/>
It's not even enough to get reviews out there. Neither is it enough to demo the game. As chadu mentioned, these are all factors that help promote (incentivize the purchase of) your game, but they're not enough.  <br/>
<br/>
Because they're free. They don't cost money. They just cost time. But time isn't what reaches the common consumer. Time only reaches those people who interact directly with you, who indulge you with their direct attention, who allow themselves to become a captive audience. <br/>
<br/>
To really push, you have to hit the consumer's peripheral vision. And that takes money. The internet doesn't count. We're talking about a limited audience that's often conditioned to ignore peripheral data. I know plenty of dedicated gamers who never go to cons, who never browse rpg forums. I'm pretty sure this population is the greater fraction of the total gaming population. And this greater population is whom you really want to hit. <br/>
<br/>
That's if you want to take off.                        </div>
