I'm going to begin with a generic example resolution system based off of AW/DW, but I would mostly like to discuss how this is handled by RPGs in general.<br/><br/>Let's say we have a player who wants their character to engage in a boxing tournament. This tournament might be something the group of players (and GM) want to spend a brief period on (maybe 5 minutes) or it might be the focus of an entire session. The group is using a generic system.<br/><br/>We're going to roll 2d6+X where X is the character's relevant "Boxing" related skill (Hard, Brawl, CON, STR, whatever). On 10+ things go in the character's favor. On 7-9, the character partially succeeds or succeeds at a cost. On <p><br/>Roll...<b>to throw a punch.</b> Success: Deal a medium hit and avoid damage or deal a heavy hit. Partial: You deal a medium hit, but take a minor hit on the way in.  Miss: You take a moderate hit and miss or take a heavy hit and connect with a minor hit. <i>Other tactical options will need to exist at this level of detail.</i><br/><br/>Roll...<b>to win a round.</b> Success: You wore down your opponent significantly. You have the advantage next round. Partial: You wore down your opponent significantly, but took a few hits yourself. Miss: You took a beating but your opponent is still fresh. Next round is gonna be tough. <i>Some sort of resource management would be ideal here.</i><br/><br/>Roll...<b>to win a match.</b> Success: You score a knockout in the first round. Partial: You win the round, but you're exhausted. Miss: You either lose the match, or suffer an injury which will make it difficult to continue.<i>Some sort of success accumulation mechanic might work here.</i><br/><br/>Roll...<b>to win a tournament.</b> Success: You are the champion! Partial: You get a medal, but don't win the championship. Miss: You get knocked out in the early rounds or make it to the final rounds (4-6th place), but with a major concussion that will take a long time to recover from.<i>This works just like it sounds. For players who just wanted their character to go spend their downtime between quests/missions/pastoral farmwork engaging in the fine sport of boxing and then get back to it with the trophy in hand.</i><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What systems exist today that can handle things like this smoothly? <br/></li><li>What are the challenges for designing and implementing these sort of zooming mechanics?<br/></li><li>What advantages does such a system lend to the players and GM?<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436684/#Comment_436684" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T01:58:57+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  1:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 2:01AM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as you demonstrate, something like a generic AW move, which you can adapt to the situation (and many of the AW moves already work this way, in fact), allows you to do this.<br/><br/>Most generic conflict resolution mechanics (e.g. the Pool), including Otherkind dice (which AW is based on), handle this without any effort whatsoever. Any kind of game with stake-setting mechanics scale by default as well.<br/><br/>Basically, any of the mechanics we have, so long as they are not based on concrete actions within the fiction (like D&amp;D's "roll to throw a punch" - even though, note, that's not how it works at all, since a "round" is supposed to represent an exchange of blows), do this "straight out of the box".<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday's "Bringing Down the Pain" is an interesting example of this, too. (Essentially, the losing party can choose to extend any conflict, bringing it down into a more "zoomed in" view, where individual actions require rolls instead of the whole conflict.)<br/><br/>The advantages are... certainly worthwhile. You get to "zoom in" or "zoom out" effortlessly on any action or activity as you play, deciding how much time and effort you want to put into any point of the story/fiction and how quickly you want things to resolve.<br/><br/>The challenges usually have to do with balancing risk and reward: if you design a system which allows you to do this, but gives a major advantage to a player who zooms in or zooms out, you lose that benefit and have players always pushing for one extreme or the other, instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436693/#Comment_436693" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T05:28:38+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  5:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have read through Trollbabe once, and I know it has different ways to handle "sequences" that remind me of what you're referring to in the OP. <br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to test it in AP, though, so I don't know how smooth it actually feels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436699/#Comment_436699" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T06:58:08+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  6:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Swords Without Master works well with zooming in and out of scope.

The core "hard rules" are generally at a fixed level of detail for combat (though not for other things). However GM fiat plays a significant role in this, especially in the soft rules, and it's definitely not a "narrativist" "storygame".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436714/#Comment_436714" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T10:45:57+00:00" title="August  8, 2014 10:45AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 11:01AM by catty_big.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At first I thought the OP was talking about the levels of detail that you get in Microscope. I now realise that something a bit different was meant, however I think what I have to say is still (sort of ) relevant, albeit on a slight tangent.<br/><br/>I have a game idea that I plan to develop over the next 2-3 years, involving an extremely rich gameworld that is something akin to ASoIaF, with a dollop of Charlie Stross's Merchant Princes series thrown in (but without the dimension-straddling SF element), i.e. a sub-continent with a number of powerful clans fighting amongst themselves, and in so doing reducing the territory to a virtual wasteland. After about 200 years of this, a period of relative peace begins to emerge, largely because the clans have basically fought each other to a standstill, and realise that it\u2019s in their own interests to co-operate with each other (however grudgingly) and with a strengthened central authority in the form of a monarch of some kind.  <br/><br/>OK, to the point about levels of detail. I have in mind for players of this game to have campaigns in which they have an over-arching mission (they might be high-level members of one of the feuding clans, engaging in ASoIaF-style politicking, or they could be retreating soldiers of a clan militia, being hunted by a rival clan, or whatever), and at various junctures in the game, or in a specific session, they could choose to \u2018zoom in\u2019, i.e. explore the gameworld in much more detail. So, they could be the party of hunted militiamen that I described above, who reach a place of relative safety, and spend a few days, or weeks even, in the town where they find themselves, finding work, getting to know the inhabitants and having various mini-adventures within that part of the gameworld.<br/><br/>After a while, they could opt to either continue their macro-adventure, or zoom out even further and play some of the clan leaders themselves, engaged in tense negotiations over the control of large swathes of the gameworld, i.e. see how it looks from above, metaphorically speaking.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
