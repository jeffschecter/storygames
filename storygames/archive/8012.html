Here's an example, to illustrate:<br/><br/><b>Consequences: After </b><br/><br/>I'm sneaking into your house to steal the Mona Lisa. We roll off! You win, eventually, and we agree that I did not steal the Mona Lisa, but, instead of being exhausted, the fallout is that while I was sneaking around, one of your security cameras got a clean shot of my face. You know who the thief was, now!<br/><br/><b>Concessions: During </b><br/><br/>I'm sneaking into your house to steal the Mona Lisa. We roll off! You win the first roll. I say, "how about a concession? Instead of you going into the next round with an advantage die, we say that one of your security cameras got a clean shot of my face. You know who the thief was, now!" Then we go to the second round, and eventually find out who gets their way, but in any case, we've established that I was captured by the camera.<br/><br/>I think that, in most cases, the Answerer's narration can cover this sort of stuff, but in some cases it could lead to some more interesting stuff getting established during the conflict itself that would otherwise be left to the negotiations afterwards. For instance, I could steal the Mona Lisa <i>despite</i> having been captured on camera, whereas normally the winner in IaWA gets to win more conclusively. I could see that being good in some ways and bad in other ways.<br/><br/>So, good idea or bad idea? Do you do this already? If so, how does it usually go down--great or not-so-great?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177015/#Comment_177015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T18:09:08+00:00" title="November  1, 2008  6:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do this already; you negotiate between rounds by default.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177017/#Comment_177017" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T19:17:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2008  7:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2008 7:17PM by agony.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Negotiating between rounds (according to the rules), however, is the same as negotiation after the conflict.  The way Paul is suggesting is actually negotating out the advantage die which I think is rather interesting. <br/><br/>I see no reason why that wouldn't work.  I'm not sure I'd like to formalize that into the rules as I could see it slowing down play significantly if used frequently, but it does sound interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177025/#Comment_177025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T20:14:24+00:00" title="November  1, 2008  8:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems to actually be in the rules already, although, not directly.
