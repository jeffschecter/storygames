Here is how I see it now:<br/><br/>The players have 6 hit points. When the player initiate something that counts as a move, the MC calls out for it, and if the player confirms she's making a move, then:<br/>- Harm is exchanged as described in the move (in case of Seize by Force)<br/>- Harm is taken if the specific roll means harm (e.g. when a Brainer fails a Deep brain scan)<br/><br/>In either case, it seems that it's the characters' actions which result in harm, and it depends only on their decisions whether they get harmed or not. Actually I'm fine with this as 6 HP doesn't leave that much room to play around anyway. It may result in some interesting tradeoffs - i.e.: You may get there easier, but you may take this amount of harm in the process.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it doesn't seem to be the case. <br/>In the Moves Snowball chapter of the Playbook the MC makes a 4-harm move on a miss for Reading the Situation. That doesn't make too much sense for me. Sure, the move description says: "On a miss, be prepared for the worst" but this just seems disproportionate. Is this how it's supposed to work? <br/><br/>Another thing I can't see clearly is how healing mechnaics mesh with the rather violent nature of the game. I'd suspect that PCs bump into violence on every corner, which may result in a whole lot of harm, yet the chapter on Harm and Healing says: <br/><br/><i>"...harm should heal slowly, but get worse rapidly.<br/>If the character\u2019s up and running around, that should make harm get worse more quickly, but get better more slowly."</i><br/><br/>I can kinda see that the design intention here was to make the situation more dire, but this result in harmed characters being unable to engage in new and interesting fight scenes. For me the healing mechanics of Dungeon World (take a good sleep and you are fully healed) make much more sense as they enable the characters to fight on, instead of holding them back. <br/><br/>Or is the assumption here that every party must have an Angel who patches them up from time to time and depletes barter-reserves during the process, which in turn motivates the players to get jiggle in one way or another? Or is the game supposed to jump forward in time often to let the characters rest and heal?<br/>Or am I overcomplicating this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466548/#Comment_466548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T20:41:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  8:41PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that your vision for what the content of play looks like may deviate from Vincent's. Apocalypse World is not a hack'n slash game, by which I mean that while violence may be common in the setting and even in the lives of the player characters, it's not a routine affair, and its consequences are relatively serious. The player characters don't really form an adventuring party that exists for the purpose of going from one fight to another; they're more like a family that tries to get by, often by choosing to not escalate every possible situation into extreme violence.<br/><br/>If you've seen tv dramas like say <i>Breaking Bad</i> and similar, they're sort of in the ball-park of what a drama game like AW attempts to do: there's a lot of posturing and threats and establishing intent, and then at the end of the season there's a big gunfight that you regret for the rest of your life. The game doesn't tell you when you're allowed to pull the trigger, but it tries to make sure that there are consequences that disincentivize trivial violence, so that when you do decide to get nasty, it's for a good reason.<br/><br/>Note that what <i>Dungeon World</i> does is rather different. Violence is more of a language of self-expression for that kind of light-hearted fantasy hero dungeoneering game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466552/#Comment_466552" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T22:07:44+00:00" title="September 25, 2017 10:07PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero covers the general implied playstyle well.<br/><br/>I'll add some other specific details:<br/><br/>* Aside from moves which do so explicitly (e.g. the Angel's moves), harm on a character's clock getting better or worse is basically up to the MC's judgement. <br/><br/>As the MC, you can do so fairly "naturalistically" - by what feels "realistic", in other words. Healing is slow - days, weeks, months. Making severe injury worse (past 9:00) can be quick, if the character is exerting themselves or refusing medical care.<br/><br/>* The book has some decent notes on the availability of healing and medical care. If there is no Angel in the party, create some NPC nearby who has the know-how, and use them to create some interesting relationships with people. The PCs will end up spending barter on those transactions, and that complicates everyone's lives and gives you more opportunities for drama. That can be really fun! In my last AW game, I created a "doctor" whose nickname was "The Butcher". The players were always... hesitant... to hire his services, and there was some politics involved in going to find someone else.<br/><br/>A character laying low for a month or two because they have an infected wound is very much the sort of thing that we might expect to see in play now and then. How will they deal with their problems when they can't walk on their own? Sure. <br/><br/>If that doesn't inspire anyone, it's OK to "fast forward", of course. But "keeping Apocalypse World real" means that injury is a fairly serious thing, and a shot to the gut doesn't just evaporate overnight. (Although keep in mind that "hit point loss" - advancing the character's clock - doesn't actually affect their effectiveness in the game, so they can keep on playing and accomplishing their goals; they just risk death as they do so.)<br/><br/>* Aside from moves which do so explicitly, you can "inflict harm" on a character, again, when it feels right to do so in the fiction: it should fulfill your group's criteria for realism ("Yeah, that's believable"), drama ("This makes for an interesting scene/development"), and social expectations ("I understand why this is happening").<br/><br/>A missed roll is definitely an opportunity to do so. It doesn't matter what the move is; what matters is that there was a) a fictional risk of bodily harm present in the scene/moment, and b) that the player was as aware of it as your social dynamics dictate. (Generally, I always either make it clear that it's an option or make it clear that there are threats the characters are not aware of - "There could be a sniper, or other enemies, on top of the building. You couldn't see them from where you are right now. Do you still want to run across?" or perhaps "You know the Reavers tend to booby trap their hideouts. No telling if this is one of them, but they're certainly known for that. Do you still want to go inside?") Your job as MC is to be consistent with this, and allow a "do-over" if your ever overstep your boundaries and the players feel you've gone too far. That's part of "being a fan of the player characters" and "saying what honesty demands".<br/><br/>* Injury and death isn't a terrible threat in AW. First of all, it doesn't actually limit your ability to be effective. Second, death isn't necessarily the end of your character's story: you have several options to "come back", and some are even beneficial. Allowing a character to die and coming back with a new one can be good and rewarding, too, if it creates a meaningful ending for your character.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466554/#Comment_466554" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T22:42:32+00:00" title="September 25, 2017 10:42PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The various examples involving harm in the book are generally on the most violent side of what I've seen happen in my actual games. By which I mean: I've seen situations like those, but not, like, every session. Maybe every other session? And not all of the PCs were involved every single time.<br/>Also of note: I've literally seen PVP situations on par with the shotgun-in-your-face example of harm &amp; history in the book, which according to what Vincent notes in the margin means my games must have been more violent than his own.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Novbert" rel="nofollow">Novbert</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In either case, it seems that it's the characters' actions which result in harm, and it depends only on their decisions whether they get harmed or not.</p></div></blockquote>\nSorta. I mean, that's generally true, but it doesn't always have to be so.<br/>Typically, as the MC, you would lead with something like an <i>announce future badness</i> MC move ("She heads toward you gun first, and you can see from the way her eyes look at you that she doesn't even recognize you. She must be high."; "He turns and throws his pickax at you like a tomahawk!", etc.), then ask them what they do. What they do might count as a move, and if so, inflicting harm as established becomes your obvious next move should they fail. That's typical and a pretty good guideline... but that isn't a hard rule.<br/>The key word in <i>harm as established</i>, to me, is <i>established</i>: it isn't just a matter of how much harm - the very fact that harm is coming is a piece of fictional reality you'll generally want to have established beforehand. However, you might find it has been effectively established a number of ways, not just because of a move you took right then on your previous turn. <br/>Which leads us to...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Novbert" rel="nofollow">Novbert</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>On the other hand, it doesn't seem to be the case. <br/>In the Moves Snowball chapter of the Playbook the MC makes a 4-harm move on a miss for Reading the Situation.

That the players are familiar with Plover already, that a sentiment of hostility to Marie had been mounting already amongst Plover's people, and this kind of reaction on their part is what made most sense to everybody in the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466557/#Comment_466557" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T23:34:17+00:00" title="September 25, 2017 11:34PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2017 11:34PM by Mongrel_GM.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In my last AW game, I created a "doctor" whose nickname was "The Butcher".

My misconceptions probably stem from my lack of gameplay experience, and the fact that the only actual gameplay of AW I've seen is Adam Koebel's Roll20 series. In that game fighting seems to be a crucial, central part of gameplay - but maybe it's due to the fact that the author of Dungeon World is the MC. <br/>Just a brief summary of what happens in the first few episodes:<br/><br/>- The campaing kicks off with a warlord threating a PC who shoots her in the face, then the group has to run for it. This is the very first scene of the game.<br/>- The warlord sends henchmen after them. Another shoot-out ensues. <br/>- To prevent the goons from escaping, the PCs chase them into the Weird where they fight and one PC dies. He immediately gets narrated back to life by the MC (without death rules being invoked). For the record, this happens during the second session of the game. <br/>- The team then tries to get to a safer place, they encounter some weirdness and they almost reach a supposedly abandoned place, when - guess what - they are attacked by a small gang of brutes.<br/>- Then they get into the supposedly abandoned place, where they have another encounter with a couple of weird inhabitants...<br/>This is as much as I've seen from it up until now, but based on the events so far I wouldn't be surprised if they would shoot some of those weirdos in the face very-very soon. <br/><br/>I think - as much as I love Adam's game - I need to look for other gameplay videos, which show that side of AW you are talking about. Do you have any recommendations?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A character laying low for a month or two because they have an infected wound is very much the sort of thing that we might expect to see in play now and then.</p></div></blockquote>\nFor me this makes sense from a "Simulationist" perspective, but not from a "Narrativist" one. As an MC I want the players to be able to act and engage with their environment as that breeds drama. As a player I want to be able to act and engage with the environment as that is the reason I play the game. The game gives my character the Huge Awesome Gun, but says "If you use it, you'll possibly have to lay in bed for 3 weeks afterwards, watching the back of your eyelids". That makes zero sense for me. <br/>Again, maybe I have misconceptions on the game's tone, but based on the playbook's tone (not based on the rules) it's rather Mad Max: Fury Road than Breaking Bad. Not that it would matter as main characters don't suffer crippling injuries in either case. Mad Max barely gets scratched in Fury Road and in Breaking Bad (though I'm just making guesses here as I haven't seen the entire series yet) I can't see Walter White becoming bedridden either. These characters - as main characters in general - are nigh invulnerable, as incapacitating them would mean killing your story's pacing and tone. Imperator Furiosa gets seriously wounded in Act 3 of Fury Road, but we will never see her lying in a bed or taking medicine. Main characters in that world are badass action superheroes, and such people simply don't do that. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If that doesn't inspire anyone, it's OK to "fast forward", of course. But "keeping Apocalypse World real" means that injury is a fairly serious thing, and a shot to the gut doesn't just evaporate overnight.</p></div></blockquote>\nBut they do evaporate if an angel is involved, aren't they? That is the point that's most confusing for me as well. I mean I understand that the harm countdown is supposed to be an abstraction of health/injuries, but in that case how is the MC supposed to narrate when an angel stabilizes and heals someone to 6:00? <br/>Here is Marie who got beaten up by Dremmer badly so she's now at 6:00. Then things go south and she gets a shotgun blasted in her face, dealing 3 harm leaving poor Marie at 11:00. Fortunately Buzz, the Angel of the team jumps in and stabilizes her at 6:00. If I'm not mistaken, the effect takes place immediately, so maybe Buzz cleans and bandages the wounds, gives Marie medicine and whatnot, and the MC may narrate the cosmetic changes and the pain she feels, but from a game mechanics perspective Marie is at the very same point she was before the shotgun incident. She may as well engage Dremmer in a face to face fight as now she can miraculously take some more wounds. <br/>Am I missing something here? <br/><br/>I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that wounds and death are both seem to be a very serious threat (on a narrative level) in AW and at the same time, no threat at all (from the game mechanics' perspective). Wounds are serious, but have no penalty mechanics attached. How are they serious then? MC is supposed to narrate healing as a slow process (with sped up version taking 4 days per segment) but in case of angel involvement, players may heal as much as 4 segments in the blink of an eye. When life becomes untenable, the character dies, end of story OR she comes back - maybe even unharmed. If injuries are serious stuff, which don't evaporate overnight, why are there mechanics in place to do exactly that? If character death is a real possibility, why is it diluted by deus ex machina rules?<br/>Again, from a narrative perspective this all makes sense, but if the gameplay is mostly governed by narration, why bother tracking hit points at all?<br/><br/>Vincent wrote once that character death may only happen if the player chooses to stake the character's life on something - which I fully agree on. This may even happen in AW. Up until that point a counter goes up and down on the character sheet which has no gameplay effect whatsoever. It poses some limits on the amount of combat a character may participate in a short amount of time, but that's all. So why is this counter there? <br/>Again: I understand that it makes sense from a "Simulationist" perspective, but from a narrative standpoint I can't see why does AW have this.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466568/#Comment_466568" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T11:05:04+00:00" title="September 26, 2017 11:05AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do not want to criticize other people's tastes in drama, but I will say that the recipe of "yet more goons attack the adventuring party" is old and doddering, and it's been wielded by GMs since the early '80s as a substitute for actual plot development. My reading of AW doesn't inspire me to do that - I can do better in terms of "hard move" than a random monster attack. While it is fundamentally true that putting pressure on protagonists is a great way to test their mettle (in the interests of exposing their true nature), I need this testing to come from a real place in thematic terms: the violence has to have causes and the characters need to have a deeper relationship to their own doom than merely "you happen to live in a hellhole where orcs attack every time you stop running".<br/><br/>(I'd love to insert an actual play video or written report here to show off my sensibilities in this regard, but I don't follow the AW scene closely enough to be able to do so. Perhaps somebody else will link us to what they consider well-paced play.)<br/><br/>The reason for why the Angel gets to erase injuries in Apocalypse World has nothing to do with game balance or the needs of the "party", and everything to do with the particular dramatic theme of the Angel character himself: he's essentially a walking and talking medical drama in that other people, even prideful ones, are forced to humble themselves in their moments of need to gain his aid. He has to choose who is worthy of his aid, and in the cruel apocalypse world he also has to fight for his own independence as a human being in the face of people who would exploit his unique gifts. The thing about resetting hitpoints is merely a game-mechanical afterthought that backs the character's thematic conceit and makes it interact with those of others.<br/><br/>As for why the game has hitpoints at all, I understand it to be a case of providing for a language of suffering. The literary genre of the game is big on suffering as a fact of life, a risk of ambition, a consequence of human error and a cause of revenge. Having the capability to put a number on how much it hurts gives players a more concrete sense of character position; it is no different from how some games use miniatures to track "where a character is" in spatial terms in the fictional space, except here the system tracks a character's well-being instead of their spatial position.<br/><br/>It would be possible to play the game without the hitpoint tracker, but then the GM would need to provide similar positioning knowledge on a freestyle basis, as descriptions of what is going on. He would need to be self-consistent in it, and still follow the principles such as debilitating effects of injury and aggravation and so on. I would expect that while this is possible, it would feel more arbitrary and more difficult to keep track of for the other players, and it would be more work for the GM, and require more care.<br/><br/>Does that answer satisfy your curiousity about why the hitpoint tracker exists? From the phrasing of your question I see that you might also be wondering why injury even matters at all in the game, but I think that's a different answer, so I'll leave that aside for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novbert" title="Novbert"><img alt="Novbert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novbert">Novbert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466573/#Comment_466573" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T14:47:59+00:00" title="September 26, 2017  2:47PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero_Tuovinen:<br/><br/>Some very insightful stuff here, thanks for that. I fully agree that an MC should find better options in AW to entertain players than constant hack and slash, but the playbook tells so little about how you find weak spots of the character and how to push it there that I feel like having to do a lot of reverse engineering on the rules to find out how to run the game. <br/>For example: Vincent pushes the importance of asking questions like crazy, but never mentions explicitly that the goal of that activity is to get the character more grounded in the game's world, to identify stuff there which she cares for, and what you as an MC could threaten one way or another. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The reason for why the Angel gets to erase injuries in Apocalypse World has nothing to do with game balance or the needs of the "party", and everything to do with the particular dramatic theme of the Angel character himself<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nTo be honest it never occurred to me so far that characters may have dramatic themes - I think I need to put more thought into that concept. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>As for why the game has hitpoints at all, I understand it to be a case of providing for a language of suffering. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI think that aspect is clear and fine.

You could simply decide that characters who take a hit are down for the remainder of the scene (they become losers in whatever the on-going situation is about, basically), but will recover themselves for the next event, whenever that is. You'd just need to write your way around any serious harm coming to the player characters, which isn't difficult to do per se - various sorts of fiction do that all the time.<br/><br/>The game supports character injury and death because it wants characters to be able to put their personal safety on the line. The thinking is that such difficult travails are opportunities to show who and what your character is. This sort of game assumes that risking or accepting injury and death is more intense when the character really will suffer the consequences - the player doesn't, of course, but they'll still get to vicariously participate in the story of the character's painful recuperation, or the abrupt ending of their life and story. The baseline game design wisdom for this sort of purpose is that you'll want a rules-system that enables players to choose when to risk injury, and you want to avoid meaningless, accidental death; AW accomplishes both of these, while also being pretty "organic" about it (as opposed to having strict formal procedures for when and how injury creeps into the story), which many consider a virtue.<br/><br/>Thinking about the role of the hitpoint system in this, I might sum it up like so: a shotgun in the face is a shotgun in the face, but whether that means a sudden setback or sudden death depends on precisely how many hitpoints you have left at a given time. Therefore, having a hitpoint system enables the death-semantics of a shotgun to change from situation to situation, and it happens "automatically" without anybody having to decide whether the shotgun in this scene is merely cosmetic or utterly deadly. I think that's pretty interesting to have, as the same shotgun becomes capable of delivering different degrees of cost to protagonists who are bold enough to confront it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466594/#Comment_466594" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T23:59:45+00:00" title="September 26, 2017 11:59PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2017 12:01AM by DannyK.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the AW setting is supposed to be quasi realistic; unless your character is a badass, don't pick a fight with five guys.

Fight dirty.<br/><br/>If a character gets shot with a shotgun at close range, there's going to be consequences besides taking 3-harm minus armor.<br/><br/>As GM, there are much more interesting ways to hurt the character than just inflicting harm; give them them a countdown clock for gangrene and watch them run around town trying to find a surgeon, for example. There's literally a whole list of MC Moves you can use to make the character's lives more challenging, "inflict harm as established" is only one.<br/><br/>Regarding combat in AW: I don't find combat in PBTA games all that exciting, so I try to maintain a lot of tension but only let it boil over into violence rarely, and for brief periods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novbert" title="Novbert"><img alt="Novbert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novbert">Novbert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466602/#Comment_466602" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T08:41:32+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  8:41AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I've said it before but I'll say it again: the AP that got me psyched and ready to run AW was the "Crossroads" campaign run by Adam Robichaud.
