But I'm not sure if I've read any.<br/><br/>Here are my general tips:<br/>- Go there with someone you know. That way, you've got someone to talk to/play with between events, and it will help you feel more at home in a chaotic crowd of strangers. (Maybe you'll end up playing together at games - if so, make sure to focus on people outside your little group; otherwise you might as well have stayed at home).<br/>- Take care of yourself physically. Get enough sleep (find a good place to sleep - common sleeping halls at con only work if you're 20 and love to hear others snore, or talk all night). Eat properly. Drink alcohol in moderation. Dress so you're not too cold/hot/uncomfortable. This gives you more energy to focus on games for days in a row.<br/>- If it's your first time at the con, don't necessarily bring something to play. Try to soak in the local play culture instead.<br/>- Don't plan too much. Sign up for a few events, but leave a slot or two open. This way you have some breathing room between games, and you might end up in cool spontaneous events (games, interviews, pub crawls) that are unplannable.<br/>- Do sign up for SOME events, though. Make sure you've got something planned at least for the first slot, so you don't just mill around doing nothing while everyone else is playing.<br/>- Try new stuff! Be curious, check out things you might not have the opportunity to play at home. Ask people about their games and play culture.<br/>- It's okay to take a break if you're tired or just not up for it. Don't force yourself to sit at a table and mumble at strangers for four hours if you're exhausted.<br/>- Socialize. Grab the opportunity to talk to people - before the game, after the game, waiting in line for food. You might make new friends, and get tips for good games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254428/#Comment_254428" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T04:40:48+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9001" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, which is pointed toward convention GMs. Which is in itself good advice, actually - run a game or two.

Usually for me that means running games.  I've met tons of people from running games, but playing games works great too.  Also sign up for games you don't know, and give them a try.  I initially fell into story games because the miniatures game I had intended to play was full, and there was an open slot of With Great Power. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Sometimes just being amenable/available works too.  At one con I had nothing to do for a slot, was wondering around, and walked by the Live Dungeon game.  A friendly voice asked if I wanted to group with them since they were short a person.  I had never played a Live Dungeon but I had time, so I agreed, and had a blast.  The folks I played with found me later and played in one of the games I ran.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254455/#Comment_254455" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T07:41:10+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  7:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like going to cons but since I'm a person who likes structure in my life I impose structure on to cons (since there usually isn't much structure otherwise).<br/><br/>Now I'm usually there to run games or run a booth. That structures all my time because that is like doing my job. If I'm there for fun I like to play (because otherwise I'm sitting around awkwardly not having conversation.) If I'm there to network then I go around saying hello to people and making small talk. As I've gotten to know more people I do more of this. It's all very conscious for me. Happy wandering generally just over stimulates me.<br/><br/>One useful thing I learned about health I learned at cons. Eating healthy food makes you feel better. Green leafy vegitables are good. I've taken that back into my non-con life to good effect. Con Food/Fair Food makes me feel bad just like too much soft drinks do. <br/><br/>What I like most at cons is to try out new stuff. I don't end up liking all of it but it is great for stimulating creativity.<br/><br/>Oh, and what people say about washing - it makes you feel better to - just like sleeping (personally I don't change my sleeping habbits at cons I'm too old for that any more.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254463/#Comment_254463" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T08:10:06+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  8:10AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sleeping advice has to be very individual - I know people who go all out until 4 AM, but that ruins the following morning for me.
