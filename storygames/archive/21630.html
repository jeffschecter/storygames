Instead, GZ started chastising the PCs for having RZ in their midsts. And we had a back-and-forth dialogue between GZ and the PCs. And then RZ, also to the PCs and not to GZ, gave their side of the story and complained about GZs behavior, in a way that became a back-and-forth dialogue between RZ and the PCs. And after a while they left the premises to continue their dialogue outside of GZ\u2019s earshot.</p><p>It worked well, I got two drama scenes (a la petitioner/granter) for the price of one and the players stayed engaged.</p><p>We didn\u2019t really do the tokens, I forgot to do them all day. The players were good and gave in to the NPCs petitions, but I forgot to use the tokens. \u2190 I realize that that\u2019s not a good sign for Dramasystem that I love so much, but, honest reporting of what\u2019s <em>actually</em> happening at my table is worth more than my guesses at theory.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473080/#Comment_473080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T20:09:38+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  8:09PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess part of what made it work this time is that statuswise, GZ &gt; PCs &gt; RZ.

We've been talking about zooming in and out of time?<br/><br/>The way I've set up my D&amp;D style, it kind of makes me zoom in automatically whenever there is uncertainty. Who will win, what's the risk here etc etc. Dialog with people who already are giving the PCs what they want tend to be handwaved while if there's a petition we zoom way in. We had a fight against a dozen zombies that the players set it up so that they couldn't lose, basically. So I wrapped the fight up early because there was nothing to resolve. Afterwards I kinda regretted that, it could've been a chance for the PCs to be awesome. We could've narrated cool glimpses. But I <i>didn't even think of it</i>, so automatic is this zoom. Like, I've got this endless impatience and fastforwardiness that only halts up when there in uncertainty in resolution. <i>That's</i> why teeth. "Wait, how exactly are your tents set up?" (Because I need to know in order for the game to proceed, becaese something's coming in the night.) "Wait, how much water are you carrying exactly?" In NPC voice "Why have you been following me?" Etc etc<br/><br/>That's why the ice moon story probably wouldn't happen in my game, I'd just be like "Ok, <i>I</i> can't think of a way out of this situation. Can you, or is it time to make new chars?" because there'd be no uncertainty. And I mean the part I like about the ice moon story is that it's possible for the proceedings to take a very unexpected and unwanted turn, that gives space travel a very real danger and challenge, and that can still happen. What I don't like, and think was the part you didn't like, is spending four hours playing out being doomed.<br/><br/>PS I'm not setting my zoom mentality up to be an exemplar. It's something I observed in myself, something that had been going on for a long time but that I hadn't seen before. Something with pros but also with cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473702/#Comment_473702" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T14:15:54+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  2:15PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2018 2:48PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff, Sandra!
