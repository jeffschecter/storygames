Give some element of wildness and the unexpected, as well as secrets that can be learned. Basically, I was really digging some discussion on secrets in games, and I wanted to play with those ideas. Blame Vincent Baker for talking about secrets in games to begin with.<br/><br/>If all goes according to plan, I'll get a chance to playtest some of these ideas this week, so I figured I'd put them online, since I was committing them to paper anyway.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what I've come up with. I've been told it bears some resemblance to Mortal Coil, which is why I'm finally reading Mortal Coil, but I think there's also some significant differences. As it stands, it's just an add on for any system, though eventually I think it may grow into it's own game.<br/><br/>So yeah, I guess that means I made a 4E addon (since that's how it'll be playtested). Check out <a href="http://www.latorra.org/erudite/Erudite.pdf" rel="nofollow">Erudite</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.latorra.org/erudite/Erudite.pdf" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" height="532" src="http://www.latorra.org/erudite/EruditeThumb.png" style="border: 0px;" width="576"/></a><br/><br/>I made it because the underlying ideas sounded like fun to me. Does it make sense? Does it inspire interest?

Pretty basic stuff (Victorian gentlemen practicing magic in parlors maybe, or kids at a magic school), and I think I need to find something that really stands out. Ideas?<br/><br/>The reason I currently am pairing it with 4E is more practical than anything: my normal D&amp;D group isn't expecting a quorum, so I offered to run something. Thing is, they're a pretty traditional group, and nobody really wanted to learn something new. We'll see how it pairs. I agree that it's not ideal, but I think it may work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236487/#Comment_236487" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T20:35:25+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:35PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this a lot.

This was originally going to be something to fill in a session for my D&amp;D group, but we ended up having a larger group then expected, so I haven't got a chance to try it myself yet. Hopefully soon! Let me know how it works for you.<br/><br/>As for mechanical questions:<br/><br/>Transcendence definitely targets the one session length. The danger without it is that the Caveats become static and the sense of discovery goes away, or the list becomes unmanageable. My theoretical fix for this is to allow some kind of rare game event to allow rewriting of caveats, possibly by the player they effect. So if you get some kind of Great Success or whatever you get to rewrite one Cavear.<br/><br/>Shield and Bless are definitely problems, which is why I threw in the little optional rule with bonuses/penalties that are different for different players/classes. The more I think about it, the more it seems like bonuses/penalties should be filled in at the same time as concept. Or, perhaps, there should be a list of bonuses the Arbiter chooses from (with options that help all types of spells). So I guess the answer is: I'm not sure yet, but I know it needs work.<br/><br/><br/>Tomas - Thanks for the thoughts. You're probably right, and that's something I've struggled with: on the one hand, I want every roll to have something unexpected but predictable about it, on the other it'd be nice to have bigger effects. It's also slightly misleading, since Bonuses and Penalties are the most boring of the Then options (the random stuff you can make up is WAY cooler), but I think most people will tend to go with Bonuses and Penalties.<br/><br/>Oh well, at this point I'm just designing out loud. Thanks for all the feedback, I'll certainly update when I have more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237122/#Comment_237122" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T03:05:06+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  3:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh wow.
