One thing that's always left me unsatisfied with games like Dungeon World, however, is the take on damage and wounds: subtracting hit points from a running total seems like a particularly unexciting way to do things for a game which cares a lot about colourful, in-fiction action. However, hit points (and diminishing hit point totals) are definitely part of D&amp;D-style gaming. So how can we use them in a fun, more modern way?<br/><br/>This is my basic idea, still unplaytested. I love some things about it and yet I also have a feeling there might be something missing. I'm going for a feeling of danger and uncertainty as well as a visceral connection to the fiction, and a vivid focus in the details of what's happening "on screen". I'd love to hear what you think. (Or, better yet, try this in your game and let me know how it goes.)<br/><br/>The basic premise:<br/><br/><br/><b>*When You Get Hurt*</b><br/><br/>You miss a roll or something bad happens and suddenly you're hit by something. This is a scary moment! The MC describes the delivery of the injury and makes clear the danger but leaves the precise effect of the injury on you unstated. The possible extent of the damage should be pretty clear, however: have you potentially lost your arm or been run through? This should sound scary and suspenseful, with the character's livelihood hanging in the balance. Here's what this looks like:\n<blockquote><br/>"The troll's hammer comes down with incredible speed and hits your head: there's a sound like a thunderclap and the next thing you know, all you're seeing is red."<br/><br/>"The creature's jaws close around your torso and bear down, rotten teeth the size of kitchen knives piercing your corselet with a sickening crunch."<br/><br/>"The spinning blades come down on your arm at the last moment. You can feel them pull you to the right; worse yet, there's blood everywhere."<br/><br/>"Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake, the orc-chieftain charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned."<br/></blockquote>\nBy default, an injury throws you completely off-balance (due to shock, impact, etc.), will hinder you if you're continuing to fight (should you be able to), and could cause serious problems for you after the fight's over. So, it has an instant effect, a continuing effect throughout the remainder of the fight, and will still remain a danger (or even get worse) after the encounter is over (bleeding, infection, etc).<br/><br/>If the fictional circumstances are such that one of these is not possible, congratulations: you're getting off easier than that. But, generally speaking, this is what you're dealing with when you're injured.<br/><br/>It also may or may not threaten immediate death (more on this below).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429291/#Comment_429291" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T23:08:01+00:00" title="March  9, 2014 11:08PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 4:11PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you get hurt, you can (and should) choose to try to resist the harm.

However, the 13+ category here exists mainly as an incentive to spend at least one hit point every time you make this roll.<br/><br/>When you've suffered any dangerous injuries and you have a moment to gather yourself, you can try to recover from them (with thanks to <a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> for the basic idea for this move):\n<blockquote><b><i>When you fight to recover from trauma</i></b>, roll+number of hit points you'd like to spend. On a 10+, you recover quickly and as fully as possible under the circumstances. On a 7-9, you will recover but the MC chooses one:<br/>* It will take extra time or require specific conditions (e.g. bed rest, an antidote to a poison, smelling salts)<br/>* You need outside help (perhaps skilled medical care)<br/>* You find yourself in a tight spot or unpleasant situation<br/>* It marks you in a permanent way<br/>On a miss, whatever else the MC says happens, you do not recover.<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429293/#Comment_429293" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T23:13:33+00:00" title="March  9, 2014 11:13PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2014 11:17PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for the sake of our example, when Frodo gets run pinned to the wall of the cave, he rolls to resist harm and gets a 7-9.

He's incapacitated for the moment and unable to do anything, but when his companions inspect him after the fight, it turns out that his mithril armour saved him. <br/><br/>After the fight, Aragorn is carrying him away when he comes to. He's probably still in a lot of pain, however, so he rolls to recover. Here he manages a 10+, and gets back on his feet with no trouble.

If you fail a "resist harm" roll, or succeed but choose options which mean you are potentially dead, you've been mortally injured (or perhaps you're already dead, and we just don't know yet!). You're lying on the battlefield, bleeding out, or still fighting but on your last legs. Now it comes down to the roll to recover: if you fail this one, you're a goner.<br/><br/>This means getting injured is scary, but the odds of you dying from any particular injury are not as high as you might think. Someone with no hit points left has (approximately) a 17% chance of dying in a fight where they get seriously injured once (cumulative odds of rolling two misses). If you have any hit points to spend at all, your odds are better, of course.<br/><br/>In any case, these rules make it clear what the nature of hit points truly is: hit points are a sort of buffer between you and death, giving your character a chance to survive dangerous situations, but they do not <i>mean</i> anything specific. You can lose hit points but avoid most of a blow, or vice-versa. There's no longer any ambiguity here about what they stand for or what they represent.<br/><br/><br/>Sidenote: If I was using these rules with Dungeon World, or a similar game which gives characters a lot of hit points, I'd consider treating them as *lifetime* hit points. Or, perhaps, allowing them to replenish very slowly (for instance, you get half of your class's bonus hit points - 2 for a Wizard, 5 for a Fighter - each time you take an advance).<br/><br/>If you want to always keep death on the table, no one should be allowed to spend more than 4 hit points on any given roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429296/#Comment_429296" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T23:36:44+00:00" title="March  9, 2014 11:36PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main design question here is:<br/><br/>How do we decide when an injury is potentially lethal?<br/><br/>I can see some solutions, but I'd like to hear yours, as well.<br/><br/>* The MC decides when an injury is potentially lethal. If the fiction says it's something that could kill you, it can.<br/>* All injuries are assumed to be potentially lethal by default; the roll will determine whether this is the case or not.<br/>* We institute some kind of roll or other procedure to determine whether a source of damage is potentially lethal or not.<br/><br/>For instance, we can add another MC-side roll into the equation, and give each monster a "lethality" rating, from 1 to 5. When a character gets hit by an attack, the MC rolls 2 dice before describing the injury.<br/><br/>* If one die rolls a result equal to the lethality rating or lower, the attack is potentially lethal.<br/>* If both dice roll a result equal to or lower than the lethality rating, the attack is potentially instantly fatal.<br/><br/>This is nice because it gives a nice range of odds for what we want, and feels AW-like (rolling 2d6).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429297/#Comment_429297" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T00:49:36+00:00" title="March 10, 2014 12:49AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot here to take in and I might have more to say on a second read.

So the player thinks about how badly they wanna avoid this blow and then stakes some Hp on the roll to avoid it. Hit or miss, that Hp is gone. This is a really cool idea!<br/><br/>If I'm reading that correctly, then maybe a dinky little goblin hits you with a stick and you're like, "whatever, goblin. I'll save my Hp and roll +0 for the harm move." But then his big Cave Troll friend smashes you with a spiked club and you're all, "woah woah woah, this could kill me, I'll give up six Hp to survive it..." This is cool and I feel like it emulates a very real expenditure of energy and attention: the bigger the threat, the more exhausting it will be just to fight it. When you spend all your Hp avoiding the worst effects, you are tired, worn out, and have little left to give during the next battle.<br/><br/>A character could theoretically always spend 0-1 Hp and rely on luck to survive, which seems fun and alright. Or they could strategically conserve Hp for the most fictionally dire hits coming their way. It is more complicated, overall, but it's a very neat idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429319/#Comment_429319" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T09:58:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  9:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

Yes, you spend hit points (or not) every time you roll a harm move, so they no longer represent your physical state. You could burn all your hit points in be in perfect health, or have all your hit points and still die. <br/><br/>This makes hit points a resource, and spending them to survive encounters is a strategic choice you have to make. You can suffer through injuries now and risk death in order to save them for when it counts, or try to stay safe *now* in hopes that things will be better later. This is potentially very interesting, especially if your hit point pool is a lifetime supply: once your hero's "plot immunity" runs out, it may be time to retire (or face an increased risk of death, and hope that your experience and improved abilities are enough to handle what you're dealing with now).<br/><br/>That could potentially create an interesting contrast between "brand new" adventurers and veterans, who have more skills and experience but less "beginner's luck" when it comes to getting hurt.<br/><br/>2. <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a>: that's my question with this hack, the thing I'm wondering about. Is it enough? I'd say it's pretty clear that the consequences of losing your arm are quite different from ingesting a deadly poison. But maybe it will feel unsatisfying in play.<br/><br/>With standard hit points (as in AW), there's a big difference in granularity (3-harm is clearly a different deal from 1-harm), whereas here that is potentially lost. However, under these rules there's a great variation in the type of damage, instead: every injury is different and will affect in different ways. In AW, taking 2-harm from a hail of arrows is no different from taking 2-harm from a flamethrower or because something bit your leg. It's still the same number. <br/><br/>Here, they will all be very different. So, the <i>quantitative</i> difference in injury is less apparent, but the hope is that the <i>qualitative</i> range of harm comes to the forefront instead.<br/><br/>3. <a href="/forums/profile/creases">@creases</a>: simplicity is always the goal, I think. I'd say that what I've outlined here is at roughly the same level of complexity as Dungeon World or Apocalypse World, or maybe a tiny bit simpler, but significantly more complex than World of Dungeons. However, there's also a great deal of flexibility built-in to a "resist harm" and "recover" move (it's easy to apply these moves to situations hit points couldn't handle, like concussions, mental issues, emotional trauma, broken legs, etc.). If you have suggestions on simplifying this further, I'd love to hear them!<br/><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For comparison's sake:<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World</b><br/>-Must track character hit points<br/>-Must track monster damage<br/>-Weapon and armor modifiers<br/>-Healing rules (including the "Recover" move, sleeping, making camp)<br/>-One "death" move (Last Breath)<br/><br/><b>This Hack</b><br/>-Must track character hit points<br/>-Injuries must include detailed description<br/>-One "harm" move<br/>-One "recovery" move<br/>-Optionally, a monster harm rating and/or roll<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429326/#Comment_429326" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T11:30:52+00:00" title="March 10, 2014 11:30AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I think my sticking point here (because I love the idea of qualitatively differentiating harm) is that the quantity of harm is, itself, a quality.

Like, with this system it'd be legit for the player to say "wait, before I spend Hp and roll, what's the worst that could happen to me?" And the MC answers truthfully: "the ogre will probably break your arm" or "the henchman's blow  will bruise you" or "the dragon may bite you in two."<br/><br/><i>Then</i>, the player decides how much Hp she's willing to stake on avoiding this. So she could spend 4hp to roll +4 when a trapped chest threatens to cut off her fingertip, or roll +4 when a mighty giant threatens to rip her arm off. It's the same +4 and the same expenditure, it's a question of when and how you save those points and what each wound is worth to you.<br/><br/>It's fun and interesting and highlights the hp-as-a-resource aspect pretty well. There are downsides, though. Like, players probably will be nervous about spending Hp on <i>any</i> minor wound because they're afraid of being at the mercy of the dice later. This could lead to some awkward nickel-and-diming of someone's health and then a series of "nothing can hurt me because I'll spend 6+ Hp on every roll" situations. It also makes PCs less heroic, because instead of shrugging off mighty blows until the very end, they're getting excruciating detail on every little bit of harm they receive. It trades off the quick cinematic harm rules for a nuanced in-the-character's-shoes view of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429331/#Comment_429331" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T12:55:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2014 12:55PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 12:56PM by Scrape.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I very much like the idea of Hp refilling each day and not being a finite lifetime resource.

Just exploring some other options here!<br/><br/>I feel that those rules are better suited to something like Apocalypse World (where the characters are protagonists in a story and injury is a frightening thing, but you can always survive if you want to keep playing that character). This is a shot at doing something which could work in more of a dungeon-crawling mode (characters can and do die, we don't necessarily want to keep track of every little injury, and we want the system to be objective enough that the MC doesn't have to make any awkward choices but can act as impartial referee).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429334/#Comment_429334" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T13:49:07+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  1:49PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 1:53PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a>: yes, you've got the gist of it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use rules like this in a game where you'd expect to get hurt 5 or 6 times in any significant confrontation. "Lord of the Rings" was one of my inspirations here, and so the ideal gameplay would look something like that. Most people go down after one solid hit, or maybe shrug off the first one but go down after the second one. <br/><br/>But in those moments where you're willing to spend your precious hit points, you can have a moment of glory. That's Boromir at the end of the Fellowship: he's getting hit by arrows by he just keeps going, spending his life-force to protect the hobbits.<br/><br/>Remember that when you get hit by something... you've definitely been injured. If you roll well, it just means you're able to soldier through and ignore the injury, like the hero of an action movie. You grit your teeth and you just keep fighting like nothing happened.<br/><br/>(Just like hit points in D&amp;D: you're still getting hurt, it's just that you're able to ignore the damage.)<br/><br/>As for how many hit points you can regain and how often, that's a dial to play with. The more hit points you have, the less easy it should be to regain them. Maybe if all you've got is 1d6 hit points, you regain them all after each significant action scene, or whenever you rest. But if you've got lots of hit points (as in Dungeon World), they should be really hard to regain, so you can't just spend a ton of them each time you get hurt. (That's why I came up with the "lifetime hitpoints" idea, just as a thought experiment.)<br/><br/>It's just a question of balancing how often you expect to get hurt with how many hit points you should be able to spend without running out. Depends on what kind of game you're playing and how many hit points we're talking about!<br/><br/>As for hoarding: I don't particularly see any problem with this, so long as the characters' lives are under threat. If you want to be a hoarder, you might not survive very long... and when you do, you'll be the guy with the broken leg that your friends are carrying on the stretcher. You like to live dangerously! Fine, cool by me. But maybe you're right: that's something to check with playtesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/triorph" title="triorph"><img alt="triorph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/triorph">triorph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429337/#Comment_429337" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T14:01:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  2:01PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Firstly, I really like the idea you've come up with here.

Yes. Great point. Armour is one of the things I've been wondering about, and it doesn't slot into this terribly easily.<br/><br/>Here are some options I've brainstormed so far:<br/><br/>* Armour is handled narratively. It'll protect you under certain circumstances, like deflecting arrows fired at long range, but a serious attack that's already been described as successful is still dangerous as ever.<br/>* For someone to hurt you, they need a fictionally convincing way of getting past your armour.<br/>* This could be generalized for literary/on-screen effect: the first time the armour comes into play, it effectively stops an attack, but the next one will be treated normally.<br/>* Armour has its own small pool of hit points, which can be spent when relevant (e.g. you can't spend hit points from your chain mail when someone stabs you in the eye). You replenish them by repairing the armour.<br/>* Armour, when relevant, gives a +1 bonus to the resist harm move. If it should protect you completely, +2.<br/>* If you're using some kind of mechanic or roll for the lethality of monster attacks, the armour comes into play on the MC's side. With my suggested 2d6 for monster lethality, armour means the MC rolls 3d6 and discards the lowest die, or heavy/magical armour means you roll 4d6 and discard the two lowest dice.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: It's also possible to simply abstract away armour just like DW already does it with weapons. As a Fighter you deal d10 damage because you're badass and you probably have big weapons. Similarly, then, if you have lots of hit points it's because you're badass and probably wear heavy armour.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429339/#Comment_429339" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T14:13:08+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  2:13PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha; I somehow was still thinking of normal DW Hp totals and picturing the hoarding going on.

If you choose that one, you shouldn't need to make the recovery roll later. The way that scene plays to me is that he suffer a hit and the effects of it, and later rolls the recovery move, maybe with a bonus for the mithril and rolls really well.<br/><br/>For reference, these are the harm rules in <i>Throne of Dooms</i> (a medieval fantasy drama game that I haven't finished yet):<br/><br/>When you suffer harm, you can choose to give in or resist. If you give in, instead of rolling, take the wound as it was intended and mark experience. If you die, make a new character and take an advance right away.<br/><br/>\u25cf If you resist the harm, roll+dangerous. On a 10+, the wounds are cosmetic, superficial, and don\u2019t hinder your actions. On a 7-9, the wound is crippling in some way. You lose the ability to use a limb or sense, either permanently or temporarily. On a miss, the wound is mortal. Create a countdown with steps equal to your will+1. Each time you take action without dealing with your wound first, mark a step. Also mark another step if you are injured again. When they are all marked (or if you have will-1), you die.<br/><br/>\u25cf If you are resisting harm by recovering, roll+dangerous. On a 10+, you recover quickly and as fully as possible. On a 7-9, you recover either quickly or fully, but not both. On a miss, you do not recover. If the wound is mortal, you do not survive. If the wound is not mortal, it either refuses to heal or leaves you debilitated when it does.<br/><br/>If you have an advantage on your roll (armour, medicine, etc.), you can get a +1 to your roll.<br/><br/><br/>And the rules I'm using for the game of Traveller with AW stuff for resolution that I'm running:<br/><br/>Harm numbers are pretty much the same as in AW. Roll harm in dice and keep the two highest (1 harm = roll 3 dice, keep the two lowest). On a 10+, the wound is mortal. Create a countdown with steps equal to 1+endurance. Each time you take action without dealing with your wound, mark a step. When you mark all steps (or if you have endurance-1), you die. On a 7-9, the wound is crippling. On a miss, the wound is cosmetic, but you might still fall over or drop something.<br/><br/>So basically, the same as above but reversed, and with actual harm ratings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429348/#Comment_429348" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T18:13:26+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  6:13PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>I like those! Very nice. I'm glad some good stuff came out of our earlier conversations on this topic!<br/><br/>Looking over your moves; I guess that means there's no way for someone to be killed "on the spot"? (I was trying to keep that option because I was thinking of using something like this in a somewhat OSR-like mode of play.)<br/><br/>Why do you change the number of dice for the harm roll in your Traveller game (as opposed to dice+adds, or something else)? Is it an aesthetic choice, or something particular you're looking for with the distribution? Also, who rolls?<br/><br/>As for Frodo's near escape, I agree with you. I suppose the question here is whether a) the wound is "hampering" him even after the fight's over, and b) whether he's fighting to recover from other effects (like having been knocked unconscious or whatever). I like your take on it, though - that might be a better way to deal with it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429349/#Comment_429349" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T18:38:37+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  6:38PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 6:38PM by Johnstone.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no way to die instantly after the dice come out, no.

Please report back in this thread, and let us know how it goes!<br/><br/>My latest thinking on this:<br/><br/>1. If you're playing a game where hit points are sparse (like WoD), you should be able to reroll your hit points pretty easily, like by resting and eating. <br/><br/>For instance, let's say you have 1d6 hit points, and you roll a 4. You get hit a few times, and you have 1 hit point left. When you get back to safety, bandage your wounds, have a meal, you can reroll that 1d6 and write down the new result as your hit points (as long as it's higher than your current hit points; this shouldn't hurt you, of course).<br/><br/><br/>2. If you want to play Dungeon World, or a similar game with lots of hit points, either make hit points really hard to regain, or reduce the number of them.<br/><br/>I recommend this:<br/><br/>Option 1<br/><br/>- If it's a long-term game, remove "natural healing" (after all, hit points aren't physical damage). You get half of your starting class hit points every time you score an advance (e.g. 5 hit points for a Fighter). Healing spells work normally, however.<br/><br/>Option 2<br/><br/>- If it's a short-term game, halve all hit point totals, rounding up. So a Cleric starting with 8+Constitution hit points has (8+11) 19 hit points? Now he has 10. Treat all the healing rules normally.<br/><br/><br/>3. For the lethality of wounds, assume that any wound which sounds like it could plausibly kill someone is lethal. Assume the worst, in other words, every time.<br/><br/><br/>4. For armour, pick one of the options below and let us know how it works for you:<br/><br/>Option 1<br/><br/>If you're wearing armour or protection which shields or protects you from a source of damage, you get to roll at +1 [like Armour 1 or 2 in DW]. If the armour or protection is designed to protect you completely against this kind of threat (e.g. plate mail against slingstones), so you're basically impervious to such an attack, make your rolls at +2 [like Armour 3 or 4 in DW].<br/><br/>However, your opponents should be smart and switch to tactics which circumvent armour whenever possible. So you might get an easy time of it the first time they attack you, and maybe the second time, but after that they're likely to try something more clever. (Chain mail is susceptible to crushing weapons, for example.)<br/><br/>This bonus should depend on your position and circumstances; it's not a simple bonus that applies all the time just because you're holding a shield and wearing chain mail or whatever.<br/><br/>Option 2<br/><br/>For each point of armour rating, give that item of protection a single checkbox. You can put a line through a box to take +1 on a resist harm roll when the item would logically protect you. You can use as many boxes as you like, and you can even put a second line through a box (making a "X") for another +1.<br/><br/>After a fight is over, erase any single lines through boxes, but those with two lines (an "X", crossing out the box) stay - these are "spent" for good. This represents permanent damage to your armour, shield, or whatever. (But it can probably be repaired, if you have access to a blacksmith or some similar means of doing so.)<br/><br/>So, a suit of scale armour (armour 2, weight 3) has two "boxes": [ ] [ ]. You could put a line through one box and cross out the second for a total of +3 to your roll: [/] [X]. After the fight, you can erase the line through the first box, but the second box is now crossed out for good: [ ] [X].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shinobi" title="Shinobi"><img alt="Shinobi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shinobi">Shinobi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429415/#Comment_429415" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T16:15:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  4:15PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2014 4:16PM by Shinobi.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning on doing the following:<br/>*Dungeon World one shot adventure, to encourage buy-in and experimental mindset<br/>*Dungeon with multiple monsters, traps, and environmental hazards to encounter - different modes of injury to explore with description<br/>*Level 1 characters<br/>*HP pools are calculated normally and halved as above- no more HP until the module is over.<br/>*GMing: Will treat 'deal damage' move as 'injure characters'.

I like the sound of that.<br/><br/>Orion:\n<blockquote>[...] It would also make me feel a lot more reserved about spending them.</blockquote>\nWell, that's precisely the idea. We *want* the players to be spending smaller amounts of hit points, so the result of the roll remains interesting. (Ideally, we get 7-9 or 10+ results on most harm rolls.)<br/><br/>Feel free to try it the other way, of course! It does remove any risk from getting hurt, though, since you can always choose how safe you are (until you run out of hit points, of course).<br/><br/>If I have 10 hit points, I know that nothing can kill me, for example. Even if I roll a 2, I can spend 8 points to upgrade it to a 10+.<br/><br/>I don't like that effect; I want things to be scary all the time. But maybe you do!\n<blockquote>I also agree that some monsters should be more dangerous then others.

A monster with a high modifier pretty much guarantees you'll be spending a lot of hit points if you go toe to toe with it.</blockquote>\nThe idea here is to keep to the basic logic of AW-based games, which is that in more dangerous situations your odds of success don't change... instead, it's what's at stake which becomes more serious.<br/><br/>A truly dangerous monster will be harder to attack (like the 16-HP dragon, if you're familiar with that), and more likely to threaten injuries which are really horrifying. This means you'll be spending more hit points over time.<br/><br/>For instance, a knife stab to the arm is pretty scary, but you'd feel fairly comfortable risking a bad roll. But when a monster grabs you with its prehensile tongue, pulls you into its mouth and chomps down on your helpless body, you'll probably want to spend some more hit points, no? Even setting aside the danger of death (although that's clearly the <i>biggest</i> factor here!), you'll probably be a lot more worried about not getting impaled on its teeth and being unable to do anything, and also more worried about getting a chance to react and maybe get away before it chomps you away. Both of those are more likely if you spend those hit points.<br/><br/>That's my take on it, anyway. I could be wrong!\n<blockquote>I also think one of the character's stats should play into this roll, similarly to defy danger, even though that would complicate the math a little more. Some characters should be better at resisting damage then others, right?</blockquote>\nI think that, in most games with hit points, your stats already affect how many hit points you have. So this sounds like double-dipping to me. On the other hand, it could be a good opportunity for some special moves, which give a bonus to resist harm or to recover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429420/#Comment_429420" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T16:47:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  4:47PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the ability to spend hp after the roll is a special power, granted occasionally by magic or other circumstance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429421/#Comment_429421" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T16:51:17+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  4:51PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2014 4:55PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a great space to play with special abilities and such!<br/><br/>Another option is including a ratio: maybe you can spend 1 hit point for a +1 before the roll, but after the dice have fallen, it just costs you 6 hit points to upgrade your result by one category. (I initially thought "2 points per +1" but that just seems like unnecessary complication here: might as well go with a "flat rate" for simplicity.)<br/><br/>You could also limit the improvement after the roll to one category (so a miss can, at most, be upgraded to a 7-9).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429429/#Comment_429429" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T05:39:04+00:00" title="March 13, 2014  5:39AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2014 5:39AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in why we think DW is giving too many HP to play with for this system.  If a character has 20 HP and they're being conservative; let's say they're spending 1HP on each roll.  They get ten horrible injuries if they're rolling to avoid the worst harm and also to recover after the fact.  And then they're out of HP.  That's just a few fights, right?

It depends if we're imagining a modern D&amp;D-style fight, where you might get injured multiple times in a single fight and keep going (and, therefore, we expect drawn-out combats with multiple exchanges), or an OSR-style fight, where getting hit means you go down immediately, or, if you're lucky, you survive the first and drop on the second hit, instead (and we don't expect drawn-out fights, but rather brief potentially-lethal moments of terror).<br/><br/>What's other people's experience?<br/><br/>Realistically, if you want to be doing basically OK, you'll probably want to spend enough hit points for a +3 on each roll.<br/><br/>The recover roll is maybe less critical, since it usually happens outside of combat (and probably only once after each fight).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/akooser">@akooser</a>:<br/><br/>What do you mean by "playing without HPs"?

I started reading this thread and I was actually confused, because "Doesn't DW already do this? That's how I already run the game." <i>Completely</i> moving away from HP to a more AW style of injury, with fleshed-out moves for it, is a nice fallout of the conversation though. Giving players a different relationship to danger (by taking away the HP security blanket) is a good way to tweak how play feels and emerges.<br/><br/>(For anyone I'm confusing with "DW already does this", I'm referring to the Damage section in the beginning of the book:\n<blockquote> HP loss is often only part of the effect. If the harm is generalized, like falling into a pit, losing the HP is probably all there is to it. When the harm is specific, like an orc pulling your arm from its socket, HP should be part of the effect but not the entirety of it. The bigger issue is dealing with the newly busted arm: how do you swing a sword or cast a spell? Likewise having your head chopped off is not HP damage, it\u2019s just you being dead.</blockquote>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429443/#Comment_429443" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T12:21:13+00:00" title="March 13, 2014 12:21PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep!

Let's say someone's swinging a chair around and hits you in the head, not hard enough to break your skull or anything, but, you know, it hurts, and there's some blood. <br/><br/>Unless you resist harm and roll well enough to shake off some of these effects, we might say that your character is knocked down or stunned momentarily (#1), is now having trouble finding his bearings, and therefore 'acting under fire', or rolling at a penalty, for the duration of the fight (#2), and afterwards the MC can also make some kind of move against him as a result of the injury (#3): maybe he's got a concussion and needs to go to the hospital or suffer some kind of long-term damage, or maybe he's just bleeding heavily and will pass out if he can't get it taken care over soon.<br/><br/>That's the idea. If your hero rolls a 10+, she might choose:<br/><br/>1.  To win the fight at all costs:<br/><br/>Accept the brain damage, bleeding, or other problems she might face later, but <br/>(1) choose to react immediately, and <br/>(2) ignore the injury for the duration of the fight. <br/><br/>2. Try to win the fight in one dramatic moment:<br/><br/>(1) She chooses to react immediately, and<br/>(2) not to deal with long-term consequences ("you got lucky").<br/><br/>If she can't take out her opponent with her counter-attack, she'll be at a disadvantage for the rest of the fight, however. <br/><br/>3. Try to keep herself out of harm's way:<br/><br/>Accept getting the wind knocked out of her, but <br/>(1) choose to ignore the wound for now, and <br/>(2) classify it as non-serious ("you got lucky"). <br/><br/>This choice basically tells us that the blow knocked her off her feet, but otherwise didn't do any lasting damage at all. <br/><br/>So, as you can see, <i>most</i> injuries under this system are potentially dangerous. It's the roll, rather, which tells us retroactively just how serious it was. Like Frodo getting "run through" with the Orc's spear: it turns out it wasn't too bad, after all. On the other hand, if our 80s game heroine took a blow to the head, chose the first option above, and then failed her "recover" roll after the fight, she could bleed to death or end up with a concussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429979/#Comment_429979" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T16:43:55+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  4:43PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 4:44PM by hamnacb.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then we used it correctly.

It's weak when one person initiates, resolves, and colors-in all by themselves. There's a reason the moves in the book "bounce back and forth" in terms of who says what.\ufeff<br/><br/>Do you think this is a potential problem Paul?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430124/#Comment_430124" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T17:11:30+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  5:11PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 5:12PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good question. I can see two reasons to see it as a problem:<br/><br/>1. One is that the moves are not enough of a "back and forth" between the MC and the player.<br/><br/>2. The other is that the player has too much say in something which their character wouldn't be able to control.<br/><br/>I feel that the first one (1) works well, because the player move is always in response to an MC move. Something bad happens, and the player has to respond by making the move and making choices. Particularly in this case: the MC says, "the hammer comes down on your leg with the crack of a hundred thunderbolts, throwing sparks to each side", and the player responds by making the move. The MC will often have something to say in response, as well, since she needs to finish the narration or describe how the player is hampered (unless the player rolled a 13+, of course, which is a sort of critical hit here).<br/><br/>The second is potentially an issue for some, and has been brought up before in these discussions. My feeling is that choosing bad things from a list is a fundamental part of AW's design, and works really well in this situation: sure, you get a lot of say in what's going on, but none of the choices are happy choices. I very much like how that works out in play.<br/><br/>To me, this is how AW goes: the MC narrates some potentially bad stuff (an MC move), the player reacts, often by making a move (e.g. acting under fire), and then has a difficult choice to make (a hard bargain or ugly choice). That's the dynamic I wanted to create here with these various harm hacks.<br/><br/>But you're the one I should be asking here: it sounds like you've run a full campaign using those rules, or something close to one. Did this issue come up for you? Can you describe a situation where it felt like it would have been better to have more MC input, or a different dynamic in play? What was the fictional situation, and how did it feel awkward?<br/><br/>I'm glad to hear someone's getting some use out of all this, anyway! Thank you for letting me know, it's pleasant news.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430125/#Comment_430125" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T17:15:34+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  5:15PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 5:15PM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like hard choices like that, especially from the player's perspective, but I always view it in a fictized manner: i.e. the reason I have this choice is because at the last moment I can either flip my arm <i>this way</i> or turn my face <i>that way</i>.

I've had a few different ideas:<br/><br/>1. Get rid of clerics altogether. I find they're a bit of an odd D&amp;D class: aside from dealing with undead and healing spells, their function isn't super clear. "What's a cleric? Do you sit at a desk and full out forms all day?"<br/><br/>2. Treat healing spells as a "divine favour" thing, kind of like a powerup. Yeah, the healing spells now act kind of like a "Bless" spell, giving you better odds of surviving whatever's coming up. <br/><br/>3. Casting healing on someone's who's wounded can give them HP to spend immediately on the "recovery" roll, which might be an easy and elegant way to handle this.<br/><br/>4. Treat healing narratively. The character failed a resist harm or recover roll and has an arm that doesn't work/a wound that's bleeding out/an infected foot. The healing spell removes the problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis" title="ebrandeis"><img alt="ebrandeis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis">ebrandeis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435017/#Comment_435017" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T19:00:05+00:00" title="July  8, 2014  7:00PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone tried this in more depth?

Then apply actual damage when it's been properly set up - the hero is in a tough spot and death is looming.<br/><br/>For example, Gregor is fighting an ogre. They're on even ground (or Gregor has an advantage). He rolls a 7-9: he harms the ogre, but the monster also swings down its club, knocking him off his feet and into the wall. Now he's prone, and the ogre is looming over him, prepared to bring the club down on his puny form and finish him. <br/><br/>NOW Gregor has been maneuvered into a position where he could potentially snuff it. NOW we can think in terms of actual hard moves if another opportunity to hurt him comes up.<br/><br/>So, if the ogre is in position to kill him, has the upper hand - now if he decides to Hack &amp; Slash again (instead of trying to get out of this dangerous situation), on a 7-9 feel free to have the ogre smash his head in (and roll the harm move).<br/><br/>I think this should feel nicely dramatic and balance well for play.<br/><br/><br/>My current position on hit points and so forth:<br/><br/>1. Draw one box (in pen) on your character sheet for every two hit points she has. If you have an odd number of hit points, add another box, but put one line through it (in pen).<br/><br/>2. Armor has one box per point of armor, which operates the same way.<br/><br/>Whenever you roll to resist harm, you can check off boxes for a bonus to the roll, to a maximum of +4. The first line through any box is made in pencil, and erased when the character rests and receives first aid. If you ever cross off a box a second time (making a second line through the box, like an "X"), it's <i>permanent</i>. Make the second line in pen.<br/><br/>Armor boxes are cleared whenever you have a chance to rest, and even "permanent" lines can be restored by an armorer/blacksmith, so long as it seems believable that the armor can be saved.<br/><br/>Hit point boxes are cleared at some rate based on your class's starting hit points (perhaps half your starting hit point bonus, per day), but permanent crosses cannot be removed.<br/><br/>When you level up, add some new boxes. Maybe 1 for a Wizard, 2 for a Thief, 3 for a Cleric, and 4 for a Fighter. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis" title="ebrandeis"><img alt="ebrandeis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis">ebrandeis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435132/#Comment_435132" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T20:26:02+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  8:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the "softer move" on 7-9 first.

Knowing that the setup could lead to a potentially fatal blow rather than just hp loss makes the following "what do you do?" question feel more crucial. And of course on the 6- you can go straight to a potentially deadly blow if it's fictionally appropriate or treat it as a softer move for setup AND use another move if that feels right.<br/><br/>Interesting idea of using boxes for hit points. In my head that feels more FATE-like and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

We've made magical / inherent armour ablative too, requiring some fictional justification for their renewal (usually rest between adventures).  +4 Max spend per roll is about right. Also the soft / hard GM 'harming' move paradigm. It lets me ignore damage dealt (by the monsters) and solely focus on their moves. The nice thing being you can easily envision a soft/hard alternate for each.<br/><br/><br/>One thing I've been mucking around with is giving the players their HP as little gem tokens and as they spend them to avoid harm (bonuses on rolls), they give them to me (the GM). <br/>This gives me a visual reminder of how much mistake potential (as a group) the party has spent on avoiding being hurt. But it also felt like it was then the potential for narrative 'threat' economy... What could I spend these HP on (since I'm not rolling dice)? <br/>Since I've been playing FAE with the kids, I almost subconsciously offered a HP token during a game as a compel when the Barbarian was sharing a meal with the party's tentative orcish allies.<br/><br/><i>You have <b></b>Herculean Appetites<b></b> yeah? Here's a HP token back if you eat all that juicy, unknown meat sitting in front of you. You will impress the Orcs, but the gods know what creature you have just devoured.</i><br/><br/>This worked a treat. It is effectively using the move <b></b>offer an opportunity with a cost<b></b>, but with a  HP carrot. It also means that the players are aware that I can compel their playbook moves, bonds, alignment moves, racial moves, tags etc to make the story more complicated. The evocative names of their moves aren't just narratively interesting anymore, they can send the story into unexpected directions.

Anyway, I'm going to run World of Shadows or some kind of Mohawk &amp; Mirrorshades old school Cyberpunk game soon, and the Harm mechanic that Paul_T suggested helped me a lot dealing with the damage and hit points part, that I had trouble swallowing last time I ran the game, so thanks for that!<br/><br/>I had a question : if using this mechanic, how do NPCs work? AW-style, vanilla WoDu, or did someone come up with something else in that regard? Right now, I think I'd go with AW-style harm for NPCs, essentially because players really dig the Anyone Can Die trope that goes on in my games, thanks AW again for that.<br/><br/>Actually, since I'm poking a dead thread with a stick and I'm not sure that's wise, I'll try to contribute with something!<br/><br/>For online, text-based games, I heavily recommend the use of Rolz.org, which is as non-distracting as it is easy to use for the sake of rolling dices that everyone can see (not as a matter of trust, but more in order to try to get back some of what disappears in session that don't happen face-to-face). Hexographer is a free-ish software for easy hex carthographing, which is really cool for wilderness adventures or just having-a-map when you happen to be unable to draw. Myself, I don't think I did anything really new to add to the discussion, sadly. <br/><br/>On an half-related note, I'm currently doing an experiment to help me get better at structured improvisation (structured as opposed to on the fly improvisation which fueled most of my GMing life before, with sometimes great, sometimes less great success) : using the WoDu basics, I'm trying to design a setting using only mechanics to do so. Everything I write or say about the setting and game must be either through mechanics (like, one of the stat is called Sugar, it is used when the surnatural or the wireless net is involved, and is also the name of the drug people must take if they wish to keep interacting with spirits or surviving being connected to the net), or stated during my turn as the MC (when narrating, which here consists in being the perceptions of the characters, meaning I don't explain things more than the characters' would need to). Of course, the monsters' moves from Dungeon World is a great help to that effect, but as are old timey Random Tables that are the perfect excuse to populate various landscapes, or determine which kind of landscapes can be found in this world.<br/><br/>I started doing that when I realized how hard it was for me to GM Powered by the Apocalypse games with players that aren't familiar with "story games", since it actually provides great tool for narration, but not anything that could be used to be lazy (like, for exemple, a combat system that stays mostly out of the fiction). <br/><br/>Which brings another question in order to this not be a simple comment-question thing : does WoDu (and maybe PbtA games in general) give you more or less work as a MC/GM than a "trad" game? Did it help you improve in some way your gaming life, and if yes in what way?<br/><br/>Voil\xe0 !<br/><br/>EDIT : also, please forgive my many mistakes at it is currently 7AM where I live and I haven't slept tonight for reasons, this plus not speaking english regularly makes me prompt to terrible mistakes.

With Dungeon World or WoDu, I'd probably use standard hit points, however, since the variable output of damaga for the characters matters.</blockquote>\nSo you have no problem with dealing with damages as fiction for the PCs point of view while keeping the "still not dead" abstract approach of HP for NPCs and monsters? Makes me wonder about the principle that says PCs are the center of the world in AW (which IMO isn't quite true in my WoDu which I try to play more like a "trad" game).<br/><br/>The only thing that bugs me with this is the fact that I'm not sure it helps players to actually stay in "narrative" mode when fighting : if the result is description+technical damage whether they explain how they try to kill the goblin or just plain say "I hit the goblin". On the other hand, it CAN be very taxing to come up with tons of different way to basically say you're murdering someone/something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445379/#Comment_445379" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-28T03:35:20+00:00" title="May 28, 2015  3:35AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You really shouldn't be afraid of anyone here! Your contributions are very welcome. Start a new thread - you can use the exact same post, if you like - and I'm sure you'll receive some good replies. Story Games is a friendly place! (If you'd prefer, I could start the thread for you - your questions here are interesting ones, and deserve a wider audience.)<br/><br/>Besides, it is far better to start a new topic of conversation than to try to pull an old one in a new direction (which could be frustrating to some readers).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'd love to hear about your game. My recommendation is to use the WoDu rules as written, but use my hit point hack with the following additional notes:<br/><br/>1. Every time a character can rest, apply first aid, and have some food, they can reroll their hit points.<br/><br/>2. Save wounding for "hard moves", as I describe above. On a typical "7-9" result, put the characters in a tough spot first, and only then use a hard move to try to kill them. You don't want people dying every time they roll a 7-9, after all. Think soft moves on these instead - make the situation more complicated for them, in other words. Save getting stabbed to death for a moment where they clearly have it coming.<br/><br/>In answer to your question about hit points, I don't mind keeping it for NPCs/monsters because it's simple and doesn't take up any "screen time". I want PC injuries to be dealt with in detail, but monster injuries aren't that important, you know? Roll a die and subtract the hit points... seems like a simple enough abstraction that we can then move on with the game. After all, we really just need to know: is the monster dead yet? Hit points answer that question very nicely.<br/><br/>You can use a different approach, of course. But keep in mind that WoDu depends at least a little on various characters being better at hurting things (e.g. the Slay ability, various weapons, etc).

On the other hand, it CAN be very taxing to come up with tons of different way to basically say you're murdering someone/something.</blockquote>\nBy the way, the way to keep the narrative moving in a fight is to make sure that the fictional situation is transformed after each roll/move (keep in mind some moves do not require a roll, but are just part of the MC-Player conversation).<br/><br/>It's really not much fun - as you point out - if you just have two figures stand in front of each other on an abstract board and roll dice to hit each other.<br/><br/>For instance, if Bobby the Warrior is in combat with some goblins, here are possible outcomes:<br/><br/>10+ - Bobby does extremely well, and things shift in his advantage. Maybe his opponents are slain, or they flee/retreat. Or perhaps they switch to more desperate tactics. He gains ground, they fall back to a different position and now they're trying to bar the door against him. That kind of thing.<br/><br/>6 or less - Bobby is screwed. A goblin hits him from the side while another trips him. He's lying on the ground bleeding and his sword has been knocked out of his hand.<br/><br/>7-9 - A combination of the two. He has struck his enemies, but he's also in trouble. Maybe he killed one of the goblins, but now the others have him surrounded, pointing crossbows at him from a safe distance. Or are holding his companion with a knife to his throat. Or he has pushed through to the next room, only to find himself face to face with a giant toad.<br/><br/>You can see that, in any of those situations, there shouldn't be any difficulty for Bobby's player to "come up with an exciting narration" - he's not even worried about that, he's just trying to figure out what the hell he is going to do next.<br/><br/>All hit points do is tell you whether a monster has been killed or not; it's a very minor point.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445391/#Comment_445391" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-28T20:14:47+00:00" title="May 28, 2015  8:14PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my hack, i only use 4 attributes -STR DEX CHA WIS- and i'm making an alternative system for monster damage: <br/><br/>Players don't have HP<br/>Monsters roll their damage die in this table (after applying armor for each die rolled)<br/><br/>1: Armor breaks (-1 to your armor)<br/>2: Beaten (-1 STR)<br/>3: Shaken (-1 DEX)<br/>4: Scared (-1 CHA)<br/>5: Shocked (-1 WIS)<br/>6: Wounded (-1 to all rolls)<br/>7 or more: Wasted.<br/><br/>If you get the same state twice, you get Wounded instead<br/>If you get Wounded twice, you're Wasted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raisin" title="Raisin"><img alt="Raisin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raisin">Raisin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445400/#Comment_445400" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-29T12:37:14+00:00" title="May 29, 2015 12:37PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You really shouldn't be afraid of anyone here!

(If you'd prefer, I could start the thread for you - your questions here are interesting ones, and deserve a wider audience.)<br/></blockquote>\nI'd love that.\n<blockquote><br/>Meanwhile, I'd love to hear about your game. My recommendation is to use the WoDu rules as written, but use my hit point hack with the following additional notes:<br/><br/>1. Every time a character can rest, apply first aid, and have some food, they can reroll their hit points.<br/><br/>2. Save wounding for "hard moves", as I describe above. On a typical "7-9" result, put the characters in a tough spot first, and only then use a hard move to try to kill them. You don't want people dying every time they roll a 7-9, after all. Think soft moves on these instead - make the situation more complicated for them, in other words. Save getting stabbed to death for a moment where they clearly have it coming.<br/></blockquote>\nI like the resting rule, reminds me of Barbarians of Lemuria, which is awesome because even though innjury cummulates, you can still Not Die after a time, preventing the players to be afraid of, say, continuing the dungeon instead of retreating into town each time someone is downed.<br/><br/>I could look out for the text base game if you want, from what I remember, the meaty stuff was : while I didn't let enough time pass between actions (not second-by-second during combat, but mostly one "action", old reflexe from D&amp;D), the fighting was really intense due to the high lethality (four players, eight characters, three survived after a three days expedition in the forest to save the village from orcs, a simple plot I used to make the characters think about they're relationships between themselves and the other villagers, since they totally belonged instead of being "adventurers", making them somewhat a sacrifice more than heroes. The survivors left the village after perceiving a reward from the mayor.<br/><br/>The magic rules I didn't understand at the time, but thanks to reading a lot of stuff here (Dungeon Girls, yay!), I think I can handle it now. At least I love making up new spirits and rituals on the fly.<br/><br/>Now I record my sessions, so tomorrow, I'll spend the night writing down what happened and think about how your hack influenced play to report here (here, right? Since it's about the damage hack specifically)\n<blockquote><br/>In answer to your question about hit points, I don't mind keeping it for NPCs/monsters because it's simple and doesn't take up any "screen time". I want PC injuries to be dealt with in detail, but monster injuries aren't that important, you know? Roll a die and subtract the hit points... seems like a simple enough abstraction that we can then move on with the game. After all, we really just need to know: is the monster dead yet? Hit points answer that question very nicely.<br/><br/>You can use a different approach, of course. But keep in mind that WoDu depends at least a little on various characters being better at hurting things (e.g. the Slay ability, various weapons, etc). If you don't have hit points for monsters, then these abilities no longer mean anything.<br/><br/>(Not that it's impossible to come up with a different way to make these things matter; it's just that keeping hit points is the *simplest* way to do it, without starting to hack the game even more. If you do come up with some clever method, post about it here - I'd love to hear it. One of my favourites is to use the 2d6+adds roll itself as a "damage roll"... but that's another conversation for later.)<br/></blockquote>\nThat sounds reasonable. When I played Warhammer 2E, the book said that everyone, characters and NPCs/Monsters alike where subject to that rule where you don't die unless you get to 0HP then suffer a sufficiently crippling injury to eventually stop moving. This meant very, very long combat with tons of bookkeeping, even tho it sounded awesome in theory. I quickly learned that most of the people I knew GMed Warhammer with a houserule of "when it's not a PC, it dies at 0 Wounds". <br/><br/>I wanted to quote the exemple on various results in combat but I seem to have lost it. Thanks anyway, it helps me a lot : I think my problem is that, as I said earlier, I'm too hesitant to let fictional time flow more freely in combat, which shouldn't be different from any other charged situation. (which makes me think that the flow of time could be an interesting point to rise for the PbtA thread).\n<blockquote><br/>1: Armor breaks (-1 to your armor)<br/>2: Beaten (-1 STR)<br/>3: Shaken (-1 DEX)<br/>4: Scared (-1 CHA)<br/>5: Shocked (-1 WIS)<br/>6: Wounded (-1 to all rolls)<br/>7 or more: Wasted.<br/><br/>If you get the same state twice, you get Wounded instead<br/>If you get Wounded twice, you're Wasted.</blockquote>\nThat sounds even more "hardcore" than the original. How does the Hardy ability come into play in your hack? Do you get to bypass the "same stat twice"? Or maybe get more "Wounded"? Or did you change it to something else entirely?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445412/#Comment_445412" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-30T14:40:45+00:00" title="May 30, 2015  2:40PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great!

"Hit points" actually represnt defensive combat skills, which each have ratings.  Learning dodge and/or parry gives you 3 more points, riposte gives you 5, etc.  I'm going to use that notion, I think.<br/><br/>Edit: So for the curious, how I'm implementing this is to allow characters to exhaust (temporarily sacrifice) combat abilities in order to increase their chance of avoiding an injury during a wounding roll.

You can still survive if you choose "the wound is not as bad as it seemed" or have an opportunity to roll to recover. (If you take an arrow through the chest and you get to a healer who can treat you, you get a roll. If the dragon bites you in half, you probably don't - especially if it swallows.)<br/><br/>There we go.

You can stun, entangle or hurt someone with them, but to do real damage with them you need to get a good position narratively. <br/>Serious weapons (swords, axes, bows,a tiger's fangs) deal 1 wound on a hit. Most enemies have a single hit.<br/>Big weapons (two handed weapons mostly, or a troll punch) deal 2 wounds.<br/><br/>Weapons deal this damage on a hit. On a 7-9 you might get a choice or complication as always, on a 12+ maybe you can deal an extra wound or something.<br/><br/>NPCS and PCs alike get armor dice based on their armor:<br/>light: 1 die<br/>heavy: 2 dice<br/>shield: +1 die<br/>certain foes can have +1 armor die representing a great battle prowess or resilience<br/><br/>When an NPC or PC is hit, they roll all their armor dice. For each dice that comes up a 4,5 or 6, they prevent a wound. For each dice that comes up a 6, that piece of armor is broken and you cannot re-roll it until you repair it somehow.<br/><br/>When an NPC reaches it's wound limit, it's dead or out of action (If it makes sense the GM may rule that it's just defeated or something if that's the tone of the game)<br/><br/>PCs have a wound too by default. When they reach 0, they can roll+STR to stay on the fight. On a hit, they do despite all aesthetical wounds. On a 7-9, they suffer a debility (-1 to a stat)<br/><br/>Any thoughts on this????

Yeah, I read all the damage hacks,but I still wanted to try this new one.<br/><br/>As for the slow rate of attacks, keep in mind that 25% chance of an attack landing is not a very low one, mind that a very single blow is potentially lethal. Armor will often be the only thing that prevents combats to finish in a single blow. Also having heavy armour you have a 11 in 36 chance of getting an armorbreaking/shieldbreaking hit, everytime you're hit. Funnily enough, as armor dice are all roll at once, the more armor you have, the more quickly it is gonna break too.<br/><br/>"That means that only 1/4 (successful!) attacks actually have a meaningful impact." <br/><br/>What I mean is that breaking the armor of the other guy is part of that impact too.<br/><br/> <br/>The game I have in mind deals a lot with resource management and I want armor repairing to be a thing.<br/><br/>Also you deal an extra wound on a 12, which is not very hard to achieve (1 in 6 if you have a +2 modifier. Weapon prowess skill also adds +1 to the roll)<br/><br/>My main issue with this system is that I don't know how to picture the scenario where you hit your opponent and only wound him, but he's still on the fight. Maybe if you hit on a 7-9 you may choose to gain an advantage over him (wound him, grapple him or whatever is fit) without really dealing a lethal blow. Thats why I added the "resilience"die: to portray that kind of enemies that can endure a sword cut just because. When you roll a 6 on it, you lose you battling confidence.<br/><br/>Also, as all armor dice are roll together, In case you roll sixes, the order of armor breaking is always: 1.shield 2.armor 3.resilience                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454207/#Comment_454207" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T19:12:19+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  7:12PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point about the armour damage factoring in! Especially if you can "lose" your battle prowess or resilience.<br/><br/>Still, I think it's a problem that a lot of successful combat actions will carry no *fictional* ramifications. In the same way that knocking off 10 hit points is boring, knocking off a die of "resilience" is a boring outcome. More problematically, though, hit point loss occurs pretty much on every successful attack, which makes it feel like progress, whereas in your system you could have a lot of attacks have no effect at all. If 1/3 of attacks damage armour and 25% actually hurt someone, that means half of your attacks do *nothing* at all. And those are *successful* attacks! (Unless you're going to use the damage roll to replace any kind of combat/hit/dodge rolls, then it's better but still pretty uneventful.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454234/#Comment_454234" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T17:05:48+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  5:05PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2016 5:07PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For comparison, you'll notice that in my hack EVERY time an attack lands, there is a fictional effect and a mechanical effect. We've already described an injury - there's impact, blood, etc, which can affect what you do next (e.g. you're bleeding, and that could leave a trail). But then we roll to see how bad a problem it's going to be going forward. Even on a 13+ roll (the least 'interesting') we have a sense that the character got lucky and the system tells that they can 'react immediately' and take +1 forward, which is something we can use to move play forward, and adds to our imagination of the situation. We know that the character can barrel forward through the pain and that they now effectively "have the initiative", plus an incentive to strike back or do some dramatic.<br/><br/>Your idea here is more like a traditional "roll for damage" system, where (in my experience) a roll of "0 damage" gives absolutely nothing to go on. It doesn't drive play forward, and we don't really know what has meaningfully happened. ("Uh, ok. So, who's next?")<br/><br/>Just my opinion, of course, but it's precisely what I came up with this hack to avoid in the first place. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454235/#Comment_454235" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T18:09:02+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  6:09PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not every foe has armor.

And if you guys want to know how it would apply to the current, Paul, please post the system as it stands after all the revisions proposed in the thread that you've accepted.<br/><br/>The basic concept behind my analysis is something Aviatrix come up with: above all, you want to avoid wasting points because you underspent. I started thinking "Wasting points because you overspend is just as bad" -- but that just lead me to "OK, then spending 0 is always best". Obviously failure has its own cost, but... can you quantify that cost? Turns out yes.<br/>I came up with the concept of "weight of failure" which is "how many points lost would failing the roll be as painful as?"

The outermost numbers, 7, 10, 13 -- that's the difficulty you want. The next layer in is the salient weights. For example, for difficulty 10, these are 0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 29. Any other weight, say weight 36 or weight 1000, they have the same math as the weight under it. So if the weight is 15, look at the 12 line. This also helps make it possible to even estimate the given weight. It's tricky to determine "Does this hurt as bad as losing 15 points, or as losing 16 points?" But to make the judgement call whether it hurts as bad as 12 or as bad as 29 is probably more doable.<br/><br/>Then the next layer in, let's say we're using difficulty 10, weight 9, that's a list of pairs. The left number in each pair is the amount of point you should spend if you want to minimize waste, and the right number in each pair is the average waste over 2d6 given that point spend and that weight.<br/><br/> In the list of pairs, you should spend the leftmost number if at all possible, and failing that, go right. For example, in our example of desiring a 10+, guesstimating the failure about as bad as the thought of losing 9-11 points, we should spend 6 points if at all posibble. If that's not possible, we should spend 5 points, but with the awareness that the average waste will go up from 4.24 to 4.5. Even if our points are precious, if we <em>only have</em> six points, it's better to spend them them than to spend 5 because we will lose on average fewer points.<br/><br/>Of course, in a situation where points are precious, "weights" are hopefully lower, too.<br/><br/>Now, these long "priority" lists (the innermost lists, of pairs) were added when I analyzed Numenera since in it spending is so expensive that you seldom can spend enough to make it a guaranteed success. In Gumshoe you have such an abundance of points that you can cut the lists down to just the leftmost entry (and then collapse duplicates, such as in this example for difficulty 10? In both weight 6 and weight 5 you want to spend 5 points if at all possible, so you can remove the line with weight 6.<br/><br/>Doing this simplification (which, again, only is doable for a game where you typically do have enough to spend to bring the difficulty down to zero), we get this version:\n<pre><code>(7<br/> ((0 (0 0))<br/>  (7 (1 2.81))<br/>  (8 (2 2.97))<br/>  (10 (3 3.22))<br/>  (15 (4 3.58))<br/>  (32 (5 4.03))))<br/>(10<br/> ((0 (0 0))<br/>  (5 (5 3.83))<br/>  (7 (6 4.08))<br/>  (12 (7 4.44))<br/>  (29 (8 4.89))))<br/>(13<br/> ((0 (0 0))<br/>  (5 (9 4.28))<br/>  (9 (10 4.56))<br/>  (26 (11 5))))</code></pre>\nAgain, this is a subset of the numbers in the previous table, just that if you do have a whole bunch of points, these are the only thresholds that matter.<br/><br/>Now, this is actually not a super obvious thing to bring over from the binary worlds of Gumshoe and Numenera. It's not like you decide before you roll that "yes, please, I'd like a 10 or higher".<br/>Rather, the three thresholds (two typically, three in the 13+ version) have three different weights (obv just use 0 for 13+ if 10+ gives the same benefits).<br/>So I went back to the drawing board and I came up with:\n<pre><code>(((1 1 1) (0 1))<br/> ((3 2 1) (5 2))<br/> ((3 2 2) (6 2.33))<br/> ((4 4 3) (7 2.78))<br/> ((6 6 6) (8 3.5))<br/> ((10 10 10) (9 4.08))<br/> ((16 16 16) (10 4.53))<br/> ((34 34 34) (11 5)))</code></pre>\nSo the the trio is the weights for complete failure, 7-9, or 10-12. And then the pair is the points you "should" spend, and the average waste for that spend given those three weights.<br/><br/>If you never care about the 13+ result, you get this:\n<pre><code>(((1 1 0) (0 0.83))<br/> ((2 2 0) (5 1.58))<br/> ((4 4 0) (6 1.83))<br/> ((8 8 0) (7 2.14))<br/> ((22 22 0) (8 2.5)))</code></pre>\nTL;DR: Spending everything in order to completely guarantee success is typically a Good Idea.<br/>Any questions?\n<blockquote>HP = Mistake Potential. Best analogy ever Eon. I have been using that wording for ages when we play, and mixing in a lot of fictional consequences, but your summation is spot on. I love it.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is pretty good! In vanilla D&amp;D I use HP like that. As the text says: "Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck". I use it for composure, footing, hope, luck, fatigue...<br/><br/>When you get to zero HP, you roll for a serious wound. We've had people walking around with broken ribs, with crutches because a fireball took their foot etc.<br/>As long as you have over zero HP, you can get your composure back by resting for a day or so. (As per RAW.)<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the original hack in the first post (and if the thread has moved on, I apologize) is that it to me seems like it would <em>feel</em> like a retcon. You got hurt! But then it wasn't so bad.<br/>In my mind when arcane blasts and arrows are hailing upon the party (in vanilla D&amp;D) it's like they get tired for dodging it. A bit silly but... no retcon at least. I dunno.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454238/#Comment_454238" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T20:20:43+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  8:20PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2016 8:26PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And yes, this does mean that I generally think these spend points to add to your roll systems like Gumshoe and Numenera are fundamentally and inherently broken and bad, which surprised me because I never suspected that until Aviatrix pointed out that it's so very often best to spend exactly what you need to ensure 100% chance at success.<br/>Not sure that this HP spending system is in that category because I haven't understood the final version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454239/#Comment_454239" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T20:29:18+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  8:29PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Fascinating!

Let's say you can live with a 7-9. You should then spend 5.<br/><br/>Let's say you really need a 10-12. You should then spend 7.

If it only hurts as bad as losing 21, then keep spending 7.<br/><br/>Let's say you do need a 13 or more. For 13, there are a couple of different pain thresholds. The table (the second to last table) has them all, so I'll just recount the top end here.<br/>If getting 12 or lower hurts as bad as losing 10 - 15 HP, spend 9.

How meaningful is it to measure the "pain" of a broken arm in terms of hit points loss, though? Is there any good way to quantify that?<br/><br/>You're right about many (most?) hits going for a "maximum" effective spend, in theory. With this hack, I would limit hit point expenditure to 4 per roll. Characters should have fairly few hit points to start with, as well.<br/><br/>Ideally, the would use something other than a linear add, so it's more of a gamble, though.<br/><br/>However, there are also a few more wrinkles (which I hope make this work even with linear +1's):<br/><br/>1. You would typically expect a "roll to resist" AND a "roll to recover", so you have to consider whether you'd like to save points for *after the fight*, as well.<br/><br/>2. Some portion of your hit points is "permanently used"; gone for good if you spend them (with Dungeon World, it would be half of them - but that rule is buried in the thread, so I don't blame you if you missed it). That should make the choice a little more involved, as well.<br/><br/>3. You have to judge the severity of the current wound relative to a possible *later* wound. If a nasty dragon thing scratches your arm, do you want to use the hit points now? What if it breathes fire on you as its next move, and you've spent all of them?<br/><br/>I don't know if it's enough, having said all that.<br/><br/>As for "action movie injuries" - do you visualize all D&amp;D fights as a string of misses, then?<br/><br/>If so, wouldn't it be more logical to increase AC with levels instead of HP? And assign damage ratings based on how easy something is to avoid? For instance, a swarm of insects should do more "damage" than a 2-ton boulder thrown from a great height.<br/><br/>It seems to me that fantasy novels and such have just as strong a tradition of "scary-sounding injury that the character can pretty much ignore until later" as action movies. <br/><br/>I do agree that it wouldn't work all that well in a D&amp;D-esque game where lots of "blows" are landed in the course of a fight. Much better something AW-or-WoD-esque, where an injury is a fairly rare and significant thing*. (And you can afford to maybe get hit once before you go down for good.)<br/><br/><br/>*: AW's armour rules actually make injury far too easy to shrug off, which bugs me as well! But the design intent - you can take one bullet "for free", but the next could kill you - is in line with my preferences for this kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454250/#Comment_454250" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T21:16:58+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  9:16PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Again, all credit to Aviatrix and her crew for hunching out that these were the correct spends.

How meaningful is it to measure the "pain" of a broken arm in terms of hit points loss, though? Is there any good way to quantify that?</blockquote>\nYes, simply think: "which would you rather?". This analysis was more than a little inspired by Berlekamp's <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?EnvironmentalGo" rel="nofollow">environmental go</a><br/>The weight differences are typically so extreme that it makes the choices easier ("is it more losing 5 HP, or 22?"). The system typically doesn't ask you to quantify it <i>precisely</i>, just in very big bands.\n<blockquote>You're right about many (most?) hits going for a "maximum" effective spend, in theory. With this hack, I would limit hit point expenditure to 4 per roll. Characters should have fairly few hit points to start with, as well.</blockquote>\nOk, that makes my code a lot faster and the table a lot shorter and more decisive.<br/>Basically always spend 4, if getting a 6 or lower will be as painful as losing as little as three or more HP, otherwise spend 0. Never ever spend 1 or 2.\n<pre><code>(((0 0 0) (0 0)) ((3 0 0) (4 1.22)))</code></pre>\n<blockquote>I don't know if it's enough, having said all that.</blockquote>\nThose things only affect the weights, making HP spends that more painful, leading to more 0:s and fewer 4:s, not to any 1:s or 2:s. The same principle stands, even in the dragon scratch/breath example and even with 2 of the 4 HP being lost permanently.<br/>Is taking your chances with rolling + 0 strictly less painful than losing three or more HP (1.5 of those permanently)? Then spend 0. Otherwise spend 4.<br/><br/>There's no need for finer quantification. The player's guesstimation that the fictional consequences are bad as 3 or more, or not as bad as 3 or more? That's it.\n<blockquote>As for "action movie injuries" - do you visualize all D&amp;D fights as a string of misses, then?</blockquote>\nAs a series of skillful parries, yes. They're not missing, it's just being parried or dodged, think fencing.<br/>My mental model misses out on the "took a wound but kept fighting" possibilities, any wound beyond the most surface of nicks, and you go down. That's a loss, I know, but it's the closest I could map a mental model to the RAW.<br/><br/>Ye olden model is more like a woodcutting model. Chop, chop, chop until the tree falls. That's not great either.<br/><br/>Obv games exist with a built in model that makes sense -- I was knocking Fate upthread for its retcon tendencies but its wound/consequence system makes a lot of sense. But I'm thinking in terms of "how can I make HP/AC as implemented in 5e make sense in my head", not "How can I have the best wound model" (in which case many other games would do it better, including Fate). Even my model has some iffy spots, like the various resistances or immunities to damage types (solved as "Less bothered by fire" or whatever) and the name of the Cure Wounds spell.

You got lucky and can keep standing.<br/><br/>I think the biggest difference is that you also go unconscious at the "oh shit" stage of "my" system, when you're out of HP. Also, you can insta-die!

Yes! It can go up if you're very agile or very small.<br/><br/>But, no, AC can also go up if you're large and easy to hit, but heavily armoured. Like a big, slow tortoise (or even a "soft" target with few vital spots!).<br/><br/>So, what does that mean? It means that the AC number tells us *nothing*, really, except <i>how hard it is to reduce your hit points</i> in combat. The "to-hit" roll doesn't tell us anything about whether you got hit (because you're heavily armoured) or not (because you were agile). Dang! Why do we bother rolling to-hit, then? ...<br/><br/>Well, ok. Let's ignore that for now. So, then, let's skip to the next step: what does having your hit points reduced in combat mean?<br/><br/>Well, it turns out we don't know what <i>that</i> means, either. You can get more hit points by being really big and tough, or from healing. However, you can lose them just by being in the vicinity of dangerous stuff or getting lucky and dodging a sniper's arrow (since we've already determined that losing hit points does NOT mean you got hit). If hit points were just about your ability to dodge things, then why does it take a long time and bandages for you to get them back? How can you draw advantage from your hit points if you're immobile? Hmmm.<br/><br/>In the end, we're left with a system with all these numbers and all these rolls... but it turns out that none of them actually tell us ANYTHING concrete about what's happening in the fiction itself. All they do is tell us when numbers on the character sheet change (numbers which we have already decided are completely abstract).<br/><br/>Well, gee. In practice this can be just fine (hey, we can ignore the fact that we're dealing with abstractions!) in some situations and completely useless or even plain wrong in others. (Should a poison be handled as extra HP loss or a save vs. Death? It's basically impossible to say. However, it could be an absolutely CRUCIAL point, making the difference between life and death for one character vs. another. That puts the GM in a very awkward position if they have to make a call about this kind of thing.)<br/><br/>Given an approach to playing D&amp;D that's trying to remain somewhat objective and "let the dice roll what they roll", in the open, like you like to do (Sandra), it presents a lot of difficulties. "Did that poisoned arrow hit the princess, or not?" The system isn't helping us with that *one bit*. It's all in your hands to say whether it did or not (except in those moments where hit points reach 0, of course).<br/><br/>Sure, you can, as you say, occasionally choose to narrate HP loss as a non-lethal blow. But you're doing so purely arbitrarily, based on a whim and what seems appropriate. There's no "objective" or internally consistent way to do so, based on (lack of) logic of the AC/HP system. There's no "roll the dice in the open and trust in the gloracle" method here, no matter how much you squint.<br/><br/>With something like my hack here, you get that objectivity back, as well as clear fictional cues. Yes, that arrow hit you. Now, will you roll to resist its effects? Ok, looks like the poison on its isn't not slowing you down now, but it WILL affect you after the fight. (You'll have to roll to recover then, to see how bad it is.) Great! We can all immediately imagine what that looks like and make appropriate decisions about what's happening in the fiction and then draw logical conclusions from that. ("As soon as this fight is over, let's get her to the healer - maybe he has an antidote!")

Sometimes mathematical breakpoints exist, but human beings still prefer to make different decisions for psychological reasons. A great deal of playtesting would be necessary to see!<br/><br/>Now, I believe the argument you are making here is that people should generally (to follow optimal behaviour) either spend 0 or 4 points. That means a person getting hit will be rolling +4, +4, +4, +x, +0 (where "x" is a remainder which is less than 4).<br/><br/>If that is truly an optimal set of behaviour AND one which is appealing to people psychologically, could it be fixed in some very simple fashion?<br/><br/>For instance, instead of:\n<blockquote><br/>Hit Points<br/>-------- <br/>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []<br/></blockquote>\nWe have something like this:\n<blockquote><br/>Hit Points<br/>--------<br/>+3 [] []<br/>+2 [] [] []<br/>+1 [] [] [] []<br/></blockquote>\nYou check off a box to roll with that bonus.

And HP is the only thing that stands in between the PC and the "oh shit, serious" tables in both our systems.<br/><br/>In your system, you spend your choice of either 4 or 0 and if you do spend 4, you get better odds on the "os,s"-tables.<br/>In "my" system, you (have to) spend an amount of HP determined by the danger the attack presents. You're not nimble enough to withstand a giant boulder? You better have a lot of luck saved up ("luck" = HP) or you're going to the "os,s"-tables!<br/><br/>And in both our systems you can come out pretty ok on the "os,s" tables if you're lucky. The mildest consequence on the DMG's lingering injuries table is "minor scar, no adverse effect, can be removed by magical healing of level 6 or higher" and the mildest consequence on the death tables is unconscious one hour.\n<blockquote>Well, ok. Let's ignore that for now. So, then, let's skip to the next step: what does having your hit points reduced in combat mean?</blockquote>\nYour luck is running out!\n<blockquote>Well, it turns out we don't know what <i>that</i> means, either.</blockquote>\nYou have a point that AC represents a mix of pinging and whiffing (and just plain bad ass parrying and fencing). And you're right that HP has the same issue! Fatigue, luck, will-to-live, surface scratches...\n<blockquote>You can get more hit points by being really big and tough, or from healing. However, you can lose them just by being in the vicinity of dangerous stuff or getting lucky and dodging a sniper's arrow (since we've already determined that losing hit points does NOT mean you got hit).</blockquote>\nThat's right, those things are tiring, exhausting, scary, makes you lose your footing, your breath, lowers your odds of winning in the fight, all of those things and also the final thing which is a little copouty: you're using up your luck, it's like "Oh, that cat just lost one of her nine lives" thing.\n<blockquote>If hit points were just about your ability to dodge things, then why does it take a long time and bandages for you to get them back? How can you draw advantage from your hit points if you're immobile? Hmmm.</blockquote>\nI got to this model of hitpoints precisely because it <em>doesn't</em> take a long time to get back anymore, you can get some HP back in an hour's rest and all of it in one night's rest.\n<blockquote>Given an approach to playing D&amp;D that's trying to remain somewhat objective and "let the dice roll what they roll", in the open, like you like to do (Sandra), it presents a lot of difficulties. "Did that poisoned arrow hit the princess, or not?" The system isn't helping us with that *one bit*. It's all in your hands to say whether it did or not (except in those moments where hit points reach 0, of course).</blockquote>\nI agree, this is important.<br/>That's why some of the attacks have hard-coded outcomes on overcoming the AC of the opponent (confusingly called "on hit") and some have hard-coded outcomes on reducing the HP to zero.<br/>Like a vampire; if they "hit" (overcome the AC) with their claws [and specifically with their claws], they can choose between reducing HP (the claws are scary) <em>or</em> imposing a grapple condition.<br/>If they reduce the opponent to 0 with their bite [and specifically with their bite], the opponent dies and becomes a vampire also.<br/><br/>One to-hit-rider that's used sometimes in the Monster Manual is to reduce the HP <em>maximum</em> in addition to just reducing HP. (Often used for undead draining energy from their foes, the vampire bite has this property in addition to the reduce-to-0-rider.)<br/><br/>So the system does a good job of saying "this HP loss has this flavor, that HP loss has that flavor, this AC-overcoming has this flavor, that AC-overcoming has that flavor" and making them mechanically distinct.<br/><br/>Poison attacks in the Monster Manual are typically just extra damage (in which case the princess dodged the arrow, but at a higher HP cost since it was a more significant attack) or they have a rider on some specified part of the attack process.<br/><br/>But I'm very glad you brought up the princess &amp; the poisoned arrow example because I'm running an OSR module and there's, lets just say there's gonna be some poisoned arrows in there, and since the text wasn't written for 5e specifically it has this vagueness problem. I'm going to have to decide way ahead of next session whether the effects that this OSR author wrote up are on-hit-riders or on-reduce-to-0-riders or some other compromise triggers.<br/><br/>So I just looked in the DMG for the poisons in its list and most of them have the same mechanic: to determine whether or not the princess was poisoned or not, there is an additional saving throw made. Phew, I'm going to use that for the poison arrows in this module: if the target's AC is overcome, make save, if they made the save they dodged it. I like that mechanic even though can read as a little retconny. I'll have to make sure to place the save in an appropriate moment in the IIEE. Thanks for making me think about this, Paul!\n<blockquote>Sure, you can, as you say, occasionally choose to narrate HP loss as a non-lethal blow. But you're doing so purely arbitrarily, based on a whim and what seems appropriate.</blockquote>\nRight but we typically only do it when it's clear that we can afford such whims. Like on a big owlbear that's almost fallen over, or a PC who wants to voluntarily add a "clench your teeth" moment. Like, this is something that we've done like three or four times over the last two years. But you're right, it's confusing to blend in some of these surface wounds in with the "fatigue/luck" -- I was offering it as a concession "yeah it's confusing" rather than as a "look how good it is that it can be done this way too".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454268/#Comment_454268" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T07:48:41+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  7:48AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like if Crawford &amp; Mearls would bring me back in time to 1974 to Gyxax and Arneson and say "these boat game mechanics, we love them, they're fast, but we're using them in another way, and Sandra is going to come up with a new name for the terms" I wouldn't stick with AC and HP.

I would've been way briefer in my last post if I had known you were still on this topic, which is the part of the topic that's the most interesting anyway.\n<blockquote>I wonder how strong/convincing this math is. Sometimes mathematical breakpoints exist, but human beings still prefer to make different decisions for psychological reasons. A great deal of playtesting would be necessary to see!</blockquote>\nThat's right, playtesting is important but this principle was <em>discovered</em> in playtesting by Aviatrix and her crew in a similar game (Gumshoe).<br/><br/><i><cite>Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays</cite></i> is also important <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Like, in 5e, one breakpoint that is apparent to the naked eye is that odd ability scores kinda are bad. A 15 is so much more expensive than a 14 but in most cases do the exact same thing. (The biggest benefit, and this is certainly not nothing, is that a 15 is easier than 14 to eventually train it up to a 16, which <i>is</i> significantly better. Otherwise, it's only strength that have some fringe and rare benefits of a 15 over a 14. In the houserules I'm working on for our next game, charisma is going to get a new set of breakpoints for some uses (3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18) alongside the old "all even numbers" breakpoints for the existing 5e uses. Oh I'm going off topic again. I'm sorry. But this is just to convey that these breakpoints are kinda inevitable in a g\xf6delian way.\n<blockquote>Now, I believe the argument you are making here is that people should generally (to follow optimal behaviour) either spend 0 or 4 points. That means a person getting hit will be rolling +4, +4, +4, +x, +0 (where "x" is a remainder which is less than 4).</blockquote>\nCorrect. With the occasional +0 thrown in there -- maybe <em>most</em> of the time (outnumbering the fours by a large margin), maybe very rarely or never.\n<blockquote>If that is truly an optimal set of behaviour AND one which is appealing to people psychologically, could it be fixed in some very simple fashion?</blockquote>\nOne way to make the "always +4" thing less unsatifsying can be to lampshade it. To just note in the text that "Often it's best to either spend the full +4, or to not spend anything". I think for me one of the most unsatisfying things is when you notice a breakpoint like this and it seems like the designer didn't think of it.\n<blockquote>For instance, instead of:\n<blockquote><br/>Hit Points<br/>-------- <br/>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []<br/></blockquote>\nWe have something like this:\n<blockquote><br/>Hit Points<br/>--------<br/>+3 [] []<br/>+2 [] [] []<br/>+1 [] [] [] []<br/></blockquote>\nYou check off a box to roll with that bonus. Now we should get a full range of rolls, instead of just +4s and +0s. Yes/no? This is off the top of my head.</blockquote>\nInteresting!<br/>You should get the threes first and then the twos and then the ones. But that can still be an interesting thing happening in the game. The character is getting more and more run down and less and less able to control her harmful fate.<br/><br/>Because if something is mild enough that you can even afford to save a three, you're so likely to overspend or underspend if you spend +1 or +2, because the weight is so low, it's better to spend 0. <br/><br/>Actually in a system with greater granularity, like Numenera, (because bigger numbers), there are lots of breakpoints where with one weight, it's either "spend 3 or spend 0, if you have 1 or 2, save them" and at a slightly higher weight, there's "spend 3, if you can't afford that, spend 2 or 1". Hence the much bigger tables I posted upthread, they have these orders for weights when things switch order between "spend either max or zero" or "spend it all". That doesn't solve or even alleviate the problem though. It just means that you have to have a big ole number table in front of you rather than a simple "4 or 0" rule.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454273/#Comment_454273" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T16:31:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  4:31PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, very interesting! I really appreciate the thought you've given to the mathematics (although I'm not *entirely* sure just how powerful the breakpoint effect is here without having some more data - for instance, how it interacts with a "recovery" roll).<br/><br/>I think that D&amp;D hit points only make sense if you are willing to consider them an abstract entity: some combination of luck, karma, and "plot immunity". And yes, this DOES cause a bunch of interesting (and, to me, problematic) issues in play if you're trying to remain objective and make reliable and consistent calls. For instance, consider that if a poisoned arrow means you lose more hit points when trying to dodge it, then you get a weird "quantum effect" where, hypothetically, a character who didn't know it was poisoned would be "expending more effort" to avoid the arrow for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>If you assume some kind of bizarre and magical reason (like cosmic karma or fate), then I suppose it's fine; but when you're trying to make important decisions in play (like your own example with the princess, using the saving throw), it doesn't help you one bit. In that case, for instance, your house rule would impact one character (who has tons of hit points but bad saves) very differently from another (low hit points, high saves), and at some level, once you're aware of that, you can't "unsee it". The call you make will advantage one character over another for no real "in-game" reason - it's just an artifact of the resolution rules. I find that problematic if I'm GMing, and would rather distance myself from it.<br/><br/>I can see a few solutions to this conundrum (I'd love to hear if there are others):<br/><br/>1. Assume that none of these numbers represent anything "real" at all (at best, the currents of fate or spirits interfering behind the scenes to keep your character alive), and embrace the abstract nature. This, like I said, can be problematic for making rules calls without developing bias.<br/><br/>That's the approach I took with this hack:<br/><br/>Given this hack, there is absolutely NO ambiguity: it is crystal clear to everyone that hit points are an abstract resource and do not represent anything. I really like that clarity, myself - I feel like it would save me a lot of trouble and time at the table.<br/><br/>2. Your approach: no one is really "hit" by anything until their hit points run out, and that's when an injury happens, when a blow lands. This is a pretty sensible approach! I like it.<br/><br/>It also brings problems, in my opinion, though minor ones:<br/><br/>* How come characters know when their "luck" is running out? (e.g. you're at 1 hit point) Is there any meaningful way to present this in-character? ("Uh, guys, I'm feeling tired." "Ok, here, have some coffee!" "Uh, no. That won't help. You just don't <i>understand</i>, do you, mother?!?")<br/><br/>* It's not possible to create a situation where a character survives something by pure physical resilience. What if I want my character's special feature to be that he's incredibly tough, like Wolverine? It's not obvious how to negotiate this in the fiction (without also making him more susceptible to "on hit" effects).<br/><br/>This could come up if, say, a character with a lot of hit points becomes elected to the presidency. They have 100 hit points, and they're giving an address/speech, standing immobile on a podium in front of a crowd. A sniper dealing 1d6 damage per shot is trying to take them down. What does this even look like in the fiction? If the sniper's aim is bad or conditions are bad, we know: they keep missing, over and over. But what if that's not in question? For instance, the sniper is an amazing marksman who never misses? <br/><br/>These sound like oddball scenarios, sometimes, but I seem them fairly regularly. For instance, it would be nice to have a magical arrow that never misses its target. If I fire that arrow at the president, what happens?<br/><br/>These situations can get frustrating for a group, I find. Does the president swat it away with his hand at the last minute? Does some weird coincidence take place, like a pigeon happening to fly between the arrow and the target?<br/><br/>3. In my D&amp;D "hack" I'm trying out the opposite approach: hit points ARE pretty much just physical resilience. If you're losing hit points, you've been hit.<br/><br/>That means that hit points rarely increase, and only within small bounds. Someone with a lot of hit points has an "action movie hero" kind of vibe, where they can just shrug off a couple of injuries and keep on going. But that's fairly rare; most people go down when hit once or twice. (That's the sweet spot for me in a game like D&amp;D anyway.)<br/><br/>I became attracted to this approach when I understood that old-school D&amp;D had 1d6 hit points for most entities, and 1d6 damage for most weapons: in other words, we're not counting resilience and damage! It's just a randomizer to see whether a particular blow kills someone or not (and the odds are about 50%!). Now that makes a lot more sense!<br/><br/>For monsters and such, which should have a lot of hit points, I'm assigning hp based on the size of the beastie. If it's a small creature which should nevertheless be very "tough", then they get a pool of hit points with a "description".<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>* Incredibly alert and agile - 20 hit points.<br/>* Magical armour spell, active whenever expecting danger - 12 hit points.<br/><br/>Normally these just add to total hit points, but if the PCs find a way to bypass them (e.g. holding them still, or an anti-magic effect), then I ignore them. Seems more interesting from an adventure point of view, and avoids some of these same problems. Arguably a bit more complex, but that doesn't bother me - it's still fairly simple, at least in my mind.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454274/#Comment_454274" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T16:46:45+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  4:46PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>If you're interested in reading a whole lot more of a "hit points" discussion, and potentially continuing it further, I'd recommend looking at a discussion we had about this which got quite in-depth. It's here, on the last couple of pages in particular: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eero-s-primordial-d-d" rel="nofollow">Writing up Eero's Primordial...</a><br/><br/>If we're going to continue, it might make more sense to move the discussion over there!<br/><br/>Here's an example of something that came out of it on my end:<br/><br/></i>\n<blockquote><blockquote>Why even bother with HP at all?<br/><br/><i>-Everything does 1d6 damage. <br/>-Level 1 Magic Users die (or Save Vs Death/Roll on Wounds table) on damage of 4 or greater, thieves/clerics on 5+ and fighters on 6+. <br/>-Wearing armour gives you an Armour Save before death rolls (geez, this is getting </i>Warhammer<i> pretty fast).<br/>-Higher levels increases the Damage Save score above 6 at some point. Powerful attacks deal 2d6 damage. </i><br/><br/>There you go. I think I could probably run a dungeon crawl with those rules. Beermat Character Sheets for playing at pubs. </blockquote>\nI've always been fond of this kind of rule for D&amp;D-esque game design. However, you have a bit of problem when a series of lucky rolls can have your 1st-level Fighter surviving 12 blows from a frightening monster, with no reduction in future chances of death. I mean, it's not necessarily a *problem*, but it might feel a bit funny that this same dude can go take *another* arrow in the chest with only a 1-in-6 chance of snuffing it.<br/><br/>I would do it like this, personally (and in D&amp;D-esque games, I tend to adopt a rule like this for monsters instead of tracking hit points in any case):<br/><br/>* Everything does 1d6 damage. (Or maybe really scary things are d6+1, d6+2... EDIT: roll extra dice and keep the best! That's a better match here.)<br/><br/>When you get hit, check the amount of damage against your personal scores:<br/><br/>* You <i>die</i> if the damage total is...<br/><i>- Magic-User: 3+level (i.e. 4+ for 1st-level)<br/>- Thief/Cleric: 4+level (i.e. 5+ for 1st-level)<br/>- Fighter: 5+level (i.e. 6+ for 1st-level)<br/></i><br/>* You are <i>wounded</i> if the damage total is...<br/><i>- Unarmoured: 1+<br/>- Wearing armour: 2+<br/>- Wearing really heavy armour: 3+<br/></i><br/><br/>When you are <i>wounded</i>, decrease your "if you die" number by 1 until you have a chance to heal your wounds.<br/><br/>This models current levels of deadliness in standard D&amp;D pretty well, actually. A third-level Thief with 3d6 hit points can take two to four hits before going down. Under this system, he has a "dead" number of 7+, so the first hit is just an injury, the second kills him on a 6, and the third on a 5-6, and the fourth on a 4-6. (Cumulatively, 17% chance of dying on the second blow, 44% chance of dying with the third blow, and 72% chance of dying with the fourth blow. With D&amp;D hit points, assuming the Thief has 10.5 hit points, that would be a 0% chance of death on the first blow, a 17% chance on the second, 62% on the third.)<br/><br/>If you want to work Consitution and stuff like that into this, have it come into play in the "healing" part of the rules. Maybe you normally only heal overnight under safe conditions, but a Constitution check can "heal" one level of damage even in a short rest or under inhospitable circumstances. Then you can still have "hardy" characters, who seem to bounce back easily from an injury, versus "sickly" ones, who need extended bed-rest to do the same.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454280/#Comment_454280" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T19:43:08+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  7:43PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2016 7:45PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, very interesting!

You just don't <i>understand</i>, do you, mother?!?")</blockquote>\nBut it <em>does</em> help!<br/><br/>5e has a mechanic that's like this: sit down, have some coffee, and then you can move some HP over from a reserve pool to your main pool (not the words they use, but...). The main pool replenishesh fully with a full night's sleep, and the reserve pool is half replenished (so in two nights, well three maybe because it's "half, rounded down", you've replenished that too).<br/>Also some drinks, even non magical drinks, regain HP. Like there's a strong cider (or something) you can find in one dungeon and if you drink just a little, you regain 1 HP. If you drink alot, you get drunk and get disadvantage on all rolls.<br/><br/><br/>cont                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454281/#Comment_454281" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T19:45:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  7:45PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* It's not possible to create a situation where a character survives something by pure physical resilience. What if I want my character's special feature to be that he's incredibly tough, like Wolverine? It's not obvious how to negotiate this in the fiction (without also making him more susceptible to "on hit" effects).</blockquote>\nBut Wolverine (both Laura and Logan versions) <em>are</em> susceptible to "on hit" effects. They're grappled all the time, or knocked prone and similar. Those are typical on hit effects in 5e.\n<blockquote>This could come up if, say, a character with a lot of hit points becomes elected to the presidency. They have 100 hit points, and they're giving an address/speech, standing immobile on a podium in front of a crowd. A sniper dealing 1d6 damage per shot is trying to take them down. What does this even look like in the fiction? If the sniper's aim is bad or conditions are bad, we know: they keep missing, over and over. But what if that's not in question? For instance, the sniper is an amazing marksman who never misses? <br/><br/>These sound like oddball scenarios, sometimes, but I seem them fairly regularly. For instance, it would be nice to have a magical arrow that never misses its target. If I fire that arrow at the president, what happens?</blockquote>\nYeah, it completely breaks down then. An ordinary rifle deals just 2d10 in 5e. So it becomes another way to miss and it's always a sign of klugy design when TIMTOWTDI. I agree.<br/>But the game can create similar stories, like the spell Power Word Kill: "You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see to die instantly."<br/>Weapons and arrows can be created to mimic this spell? Even though the default magic arrow just is a +1 to hit and damage. That doesn't have to be the be-all, end-all.\n<blockquote>These situations can get frustrating for a group, I find. Does the president swat it away with his hand at the last minute? Does some weird coincidence take place, like a pigeon happening to fly between the arrow and the target?</blockquote>\nWe probably just laugh about it and move on? The HP mechanic <em>is</em> weird.<br/><br/>Also, some of these can be examples where you might want to make an exception. Like Wolverine, she can (or he can) describe the attacks as really being hit, but being so tough. The system has room for it. Only "lingering injuries" from the table are the real injuries.<br/>Again, your "it wasn't so bad" thing? The system has room for that, too. I offered this as a concession of confusion earlier but it sounds like to the sort of gritty actiony stories you want to tell, it's a big pro. Use the variant in the DMG where every crit, instead of every time you go to zero, causes a lingering injury?<br/>For me, I don't really miss the "took a wound but kept fighting" story moments.\n<blockquote>3. In my D&amp;D "hack" I'm trying out the opposite approach: hit points ARE pretty much just physical resilience. If you're losing hit points, you've been hit.<br/><br/>That means that hit points rarely increase, and only within small bounds. Someone with a lot of hit points has an "action movie hero" kind of vibe, where they can just shrug off a couple of injuries and keep on going. But that's fairly rare; most people go down when hit once or twice. (That's the sweet spot for me in a game like D&amp;D anyway.)<br/><br/>I became attracted to this approach when I understood that old-school D&amp;D had 1d6 hit points for most entities, and 1d6 damage for most weapons: in other words, we're not counting resilience and damage! It's just a randomizer to see whether a particular blow kills someone or not (and the odds are about 50%!). Now that makes a lot more sense!</blockquote>\nThat's how it was at low levels. You had 1d6 <em>per level</em>.<br/>In ye olden days, fighters died after one hit and you rolled to hit. Then they invented heroes that died after four hits and super heroes that died after eight hits. This was before D&amp;D. (Those later became  fighter level 4 and fighter level 8 respectively, and they changed "one hit" to "one d6".)<br/>You die after four hits, maybe the president-elect is a hero?<br/><br/>I think that if I would've invented a game I would've made you get a wound (or die) everytime you got hit. Not bother with this luck-warping "Hit Points" And it would've been a lot less fun to play than D&amp;D. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>I don't want to hack too much, I think that's the crux. I have no qualms ripping out an entire subsystem and replacing it with something from another game or something I've designed, and maybe one day I'll do that for wounds and hitting, but I think what we have has so far provided great experience at play.\n<blockquote>Normally these just add to total hit points, but if the PCs find a way to bypass them (e.g. holding them still, or an anti-magic effect)</blockquote>\n3e D&amp;D had a lot of this with a long list of ACs (one if you're unaware of the attack (AC minus the dodge part), one if the attack ignores your armor (AC with only the dodge part) and a whole bunch of others, I think four in total including normal AC). I'm also enjoying 5e because it's simple and fast!<br/>You're fighting along, whittling each other's abstract HP pool down and then bam! Oh no! You might die! Time to roll death saves and lingering injury!<br/>But the system is just a mechanical baseline with lots of interesting (and sometimes weird) exceptions, like the aforementioned vampire bite.<br/><br/>It does the "fence parry fence parry riposte parry fence oh no I died" thing well, with "missed rolls" representing a well parried attack and "hit rolls" representing attacks that cause you a bit more doubt.<br/><br/>And it does the insect swarm well -- the bugs are very likely to affect your ability to continue fighting without completely stopping you.<br/>And it does the 2-ton-rock well -- it either ends the fight quickly, or it's sidestepped causually, or it's a <em>major</em> shock.<br/><br/>It does make significantly less sense in situations where God made a rock too heavy to lift or the danger of the attack is unknown (like secret poison) and some of these situations are common, some are uncommon. But D&amp;D is like Achilles' record player. <em>Most</em> songs sound great on it.<br/><br/>You've made a system where you can afford to get hit just a couple of times over your life unless you get significant magical healing or resurrection.<br/>And a system with that property -- that's what I already have and use and love.<br/><br/>I think in OD&amp;D, HP absolutely represented... well.. it says:<br/><br/>"[HP] being the number of points of damage the character could sustain before death. Whether sustaining accumulative hits will otherwise affect a character is left to the discretion of the referee."<br/>and<br/>"All attacks which score hits do 1-6 damage unless otherwise noted."<br/><br/>So that's the nostalgia history of OD&amp;D.<br/>To-hit-rolls that lead to a damage roll that lead to dimishing HP that lead to death.<br/>That's the mechanical core.<br/>What we then wrap around that in terms of imagined space, and what mechanics we build around that, well, that can be done a thousand ways or you can use some completely other system of wounds and consequences and injuries.<br/><br/>I've gone for a kinda veiled take on the violence. It becomes real when it becomes real, sure, but until HP 0, it's just fun and games. Shields and mystical auras and fancy footwork and parrying blades and "phew, that was close!"<br/><br/>We see a lot of character death in our games as it is.<br/>Those death save rolls and that instant-death rule see a lot of use.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454282/#Comment_454282" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T19:45:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  7:45PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>That's right, playtesting is important but this principle was <em>discovered</em> in playtesting by Aviatrix and her crew in a similar game (Gumshoe).<br/></blockquote>\nI'm only a bystander in this conversation, but the optimal spend issue in Gumshoe was driven home to me <a href="http://transitivegaming.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-fight-gone-wrong.html" rel="nofollow">more by an article that specifically referenced Night's Black Agents</a>; this was the first place I really thought about the truth it expressed.<br/><br/>Once you do that, it's obvious that the utility value of a points spent on a failed roll is at best zero, so now as part of my Gumshoe orientation I strongly encourage players to spend either 3 points or 0.<br/><br/>The Stability system was where this really showed the fraying, because here you actually <i>did</i> have a weighting, in that there is a potential Stability loss for a failed roll. This means that for any given test there will be an optimax solution, and since Stability is crucial to being able to do things, most people spent some time trying to find the solution. In practice, of course, it basically worked out to "Spend 0, 3, or 4 points."

Because if you spend less, you will most likely miss the roll AND lose the points.

Because if you spend less, you will most likely miss the roll AND lose the points. If you decide it's not worth it, you shouldn't spend any points.<br/><br/>Another house rule which could address this would be an automatic 1pt spend any time you have to make the roll.<br/><br/>In any case, this is very thought-provoking.

If the curve was steep enough, it might affect the "recommended behaviour"...</blockquote>\nNumenera does this, well, they use increasing returns instead of diminishing returns. Their name for the number you subtract from the difficulty (actually the same as adding it to the die) is "effort" and then thee first "effort" per roll costs 3 from your "pool", all the following costs 2.<br/><br/>What happens? That the formula stops caring about pool and starts caring about effort, leaving the exchange rates to the player.<br/>I.e it becomes "If failing the roll is as painful as paying for X effort, you should pay for Y effort, otherwise Z effort", where Y quickly becomes "as much as you can" and Z quickly zero.[*]<br/><br/>In short: no change.<br/><br/>The 2d6 bell curve already creates a diminishing returns effect, and this effect makes the table more collapsed, not less. Combined with the 4-spend max it quickly becomes 4 or 0. Whereas a linear curve might have <em>some</em> weights left where 1, 2 or 3 would be best. That wouldn't make it any better though, you'd just need a look-up table in front of you.<br/><br/>As for the automatic one hp loss each roll, that shouldn't change anything either. You can't win that HP back. And you can't choose whether or not to roll.<br/>It becomes exactly the same math and tables as before, only that you now have one HP less to spend from -- the math isn't dependant on your current amount of hit points (except to determine when you <em>can't</em> spend it all.)<br/><br/><br/>[*]<small>Numenera does become a little more nuanced but that's because of other factors, not this separation between "effort" and pool spend. Numenera requires a ternary lookup table: the difficulty (not always 7-9, it can be set by the DM or by the game's circumstances to be 1-10), the weight, and then finally how much you even <em>can</em> spend since you have a ridiculously small pool size making it impossible to reduce the difficulty to one. So depending on the weight of the roll you should spend it all or spend zero -- but where that weight is changes depending on what "it all" is. If you only have 1 left, the weight it requires for you to spend it is higher than if you only have 4 left and so on.<br/><br/>But, I have created this table. It only makes the game <em>more</em> broken in my opinion.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454321/#Comment_454321" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T06:39:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  6:39AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2016 6:40AM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's not really a choice when it comes to how much HP to spend, it's just that the breakpoints in some games can become very many and it becomes a little complicated.<br/>It happened to become easy in PbtA-hacked because of the bell curve, the fixed difficulty and the 4-cap. It happened to become easy in Gumshoe because of the coarse grained die and Aviatrix' house rule setting the difficulty to a fixed 4.<br/>But having it complicated is no virtue; it doesn't make it any less "scripted".<br/><br/>So instead of having a fa\xe7ade of voluntary point spend, I suggest two little changes to your hack:<br/>1. When you get hurt, you mandantorily lose an amount of points that varies to the degree of danger involved in the attack. This will create a nuanced and unpredictable point loss instead of the static ticks of 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4 (or in case of always losing 1: 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4). Your HP becomes something you care about and you don't really know how fast it'll be gone. Something you want to manage but it can fly away like birds in the night at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>2. And then, instead of bothering with the extra step of rolling dice, you can just clench teeth and be tough -- as long as you had HP to lose. If you're at zero, only then do you have to make the dangerous rolls, risking a serious consequence or death. This creates the action moments that you desire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454339/#Comment_454339" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T15:22:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  3:22PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>You're spot on about the math.<br/><br/>But your "suggested fix" is pretty funny, since it is effectively just a regression to hit points - the D&amp;D/Dungeon World model that I was trying to improve on. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So, I'm not sure  if you were joking or not, but it's obviously not to my tastes.<br/><br/>I'll be back later to explain how my hack solves the problems I mentioned earlier, if that's something you're still curious about.

HP protects you, when it's depleted, you roll to see if you die or live. If live, you roll to see what injury (and the mildest being "minor scar") and for each injury it says what spells are needed to restore it or disguise it -- just restoring HP doesn't help it.<br/><br/><br/>The differences are:<br/>1. I go unconscious at zero, you don't<br/>2. My numbers vary with the threat of the attack, yours don't<br/>3. You have to roll on the tables every time (but the HP spent protects you on the tables), I only have to when the HP is depleted completely<br/>3. Overall the numbers and tables are slightly different<br/>4. [Not sure if this is a difference but in 5e there are lots of ways to straight up die, bypassing these tables - such as exhaustion, extreme hp loss, or certain spells]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p7">7</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 4 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 4" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="It's also in accordance with the text, which I've quoted upthread.

The table is not open source but here it is:\n<blockquote><b>1 Lose an Eye.</b><br/>You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded.<br/><br/><b>2 Lose an Arm or a Hand.</b> You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.<br/><br/><b>3 Lose a Foot or Leg.</b> Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.<br/><br/><b>4 Limp.</b> Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.<br/><br/><b>5-7 Internal Injury.</b> Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.<br/><br/><b>8-10 Broken Ribs.</b> This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.<br/><br/><b>11-13 Horrible Scar.</b> You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar.<br/><br/><b>14-16 Festering Wound.</b> Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals.<br/><br/><b>17-20 Minor Scar.</b> The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar.</blockquote>\nOr you can use any other hit location method. What I like about this version of the table is that it explicitly says how to fix the injury, and that it ranges from pretty mild to pretty bad. (Of course you can also die outright on the death saves before even getting to this table.)<br/><br/>It also gives three options for how to use this:<br/>\u2022 Any crit [My comment this could be a way for you to get the action movie style you want: soldiering on even after like losing a foot or something]<br/>\u2022 When the character drops to 0<br/>\u2022 When the player rolls 4 or lower on a death save [rephrased, their phrasing is more convoluted]<br/><br/>[My comment: Of course if you combine two or more of these, you get even more injuries. Crits AND zeros AND super low death save rolls.]<br/><br/>It also goes on give an alternative option: to use the same table but only use the bolded part and then not put a game effect in there, to just allow players to use it for insp fishing a la Fate consequences.<br/><br/>It's then followed by another optional rule I didn't notice until today which makes it easier for characters to die from big hits and introduces a "system shock" roll table. It's interesting, if you take a certain amount of HP loss in one sweep you roll on this table and some of the effects include falling unconscious or getting stunned. But, it clashes with my vision of what HP is, and the characters in my game die easily enough.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454426/#Comment_454426" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T17:30:48+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  5:30PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my games, and we use the drop-to-zero method, crits have been more common than drop-to-zero and obv super low death saves only can happen after someone has already dropped to zero, so they're per definition rarer. Not <i>strictly</i>, because someone could then sustain <i>multiple</i> lingering injuries.<br/>Another reason I've chosen the drop-to-zero option is that it's something you can roll <i>if</i> the character survives. No need to do it if they're already dead.<br/>But the crit version I see a lot of appeal, and also combining versions.<br/><br/>The sort of fantasy I'm after is "it's all fun and games until someone gets to zero", but as you can see there are some options there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454435/#Comment_454435" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T18:22:05+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  6:22PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 6:25PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how does it work?

It's a convoluted procedure that involves getting three fails or three successes with lots of exceptions and special weirdness but <i>typically</i> you either die then and there, or are unconscious for 1d4 hours.<br/><br/>If you don't die, we roll on the table. (Again, there are other options but that's how I do it.)<br/>If you do die then we don't roll on the table.\n<blockquote>I don't like that there's no relationship between *how* you lost your last hit points and the injury you receive, but that's pretty typical for how D&amp;D rules tend to work, and it's probably functional enough most of the time.</blockquote>\nYeah, a couple of dissonant ideas come up and the group weave it together into a coherent narrative. Like "Your foot got burned off in the fireball" or "Your face is completely disfigured with bubbles from the venom spray".\n<blockquote>I do like how it makes falling to 0 hp very scary (and consequential) but effectively relatively toothless if you have access to magical healing.</blockquote>\nWhat has happened is that characters have died because they were so worn down with lost feet and broken ribs that the next fight, before they even had magical healing, were more dangerous.<br/><br/>And to heal some of this stuff we're talking level 11 characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454458/#Comment_454458" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T20:37:38+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  8:37PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that seems pretty workable. It's also a good match for your vision of hit points as "dramatic immunity in a given fight", which recovers quickly and isn't strictly related to your state of injury.<br/><br/>It does, to my mind, still have the usual issues of D&amp;D hit points, which is that they simply <i>break down</i> any time we zoom in on what's happening enough to discuss the details of what's happening. The earlier "presidential assassination" is one example; here's another:<br/><br/>You're fighting a monster, and one of your hands is stuck to one of those magically-sticky D&amp;D spiderwebs. You have your sword in your other hand, fending off the beast. However, a friend (or perhaps a sadistic enemy!) comes by and says they chop at your arm with their sword. They're trying to cut off your hand, so you'll be free from the web.<br/><br/>As soon as we "zoom in" on the fiction to that kind of degree, traditional D&amp;D-style hit points become incredibly clumsy and they get in our way. If the idea is that no one gets hurt until they lose all their hit points, how do we handle this? Sure, there's lots of ways we can do it, but not by following the existing rules - we have to break away from them.<br/><br/>Some people are very good at doing that; they make a ruling on the spot and we move on. (And many versions of D&amp;D have some add-on rules for "called shots" or "critical injuries" to paste over this kind of cludge.) <br/><br/>A similar issue is walking up behind someone and trying to knock them out by hitting them over the head. I've yet to see a D&amp;D rule for this kind of thing which actually works, and, even if it does, it's going to be an exception-based rule. Hit points just won't cut it.<br/><br/>To me, it's awkward game design if it forces you to do that (i.e. make rulings on the spot, or pull in optional rules, because the basic rules can't handle that situation). I prefer playing a game where that kind of conundrum doesn't come up in the first place.<br/><br/>Hit points work just great when all you're doing is narrating abstract actions - "I'm attacking so and so", "A new encounter begins here", "You two are attacking the ogre; she is casting a spell". <br/><br/>For a game which focuses in more on the specifics of the imagined space, however, things can get pretty difficult. Since Dungeon World-type games seek to deliver that kind of experience, I feel they need rules which interact with those fictional details in a productive way, so that our narrations and our character choices matter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454465/#Comment_454465" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T21:00:05+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  9:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I've definitely run into the presidential assassination issue in actual play and it's a real problem, though rare.

Fate Core. I remember now: you enter a conflict, and then you can "take" hits to your stress track (basically hit points, except that they don't always add together), or take them as consequence. If you are unwilling or unable, you lose the conflict, instead.<br/><br/>I like this approach, and I think it's good, but it's very "meta". We're dealing with positioning numbers on a sheet, balancing advantage against disadvantage, and so on. Here, I wanted to create something really different.<br/><br/>So, issues with D&amp;D hit points:<br/><br/>* It's not clear what they represent. Luck, physical toughness, fatigue, armour, etc, etc. Lots of overlapping concepts create the potential for misunderstanding. (Although that can be circumvented by a group that has a very disciplined approach, like your fairly clear stance that "no one gets hit until their hit points are depleted". Still, there are fuzzy areas - you're fighting a Giant Ooze in a right corridor, and you're going to tell me that bringing down its hit points does NOT mean it's getting hit?)<br/><br/>* Not knowing what they represent means that rules for things like poisons and healing are generally inconsistent or, similarly, wildly abstract. (e.g. Why is a healing spell more effective on a weak character than a strong character?)<br/><br/>* "To-hit" rolls do NOT actually help us figure out whether someone was hit or not. "Missing" can mean the person dodged; but so can losing some hit points. We just don't know!<br/><br/>* Armor class, similarly, does not help us decide whether someone actually got hit or not. You can have a high AC because you're very agile, or because you're very sturdy, and they're handled the same way. Especially if you add them together, again, we get no help from the system in terms of imagining what's actually happening.<br/><br/>* Finally, removing hit points may or may not mean you got hit, and we have no way to determine which.<br/><br/>All of these are abstractions which work well when handled as abstractions, but leave us hanging whenever we try to "zoom in" and see what's actually going on in detail.<br/><br/>* Hit points can make some people "invincible" when they shouldn't be (e.g. assassinating the president). Sometimes we don't mind this and we roll with the punches; sometimes we have to make house rules or rulings to make things work out.<br/><br/>* Hit points can make people extremely fragile when they shouldn't be. (You have 1 hit point left, and some punches you in the arm. Depending on the edition of D&amp;D, this could leave you dead, unconscious or with a weird injury like "missing an eye".)<br/><br/>Some of these things are handled by a particular set of house rules in this edition or that, but I've never seen a ruleset which handles them all.<br/><br/>Now, I named this thread a "A <i>Descriptive</i> Damage Hack". What makes AW-based games somewhat interesting to a lot of people is that the rules make the description *really matter*. I wanted to bring the importance of the description happening at the table to the forefront with these rules.<br/><br/>(Would that be even better without hit points at all? Definitely, and I've developed rules along those lines before, like here<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. But in this case I was curious if I could accomplish anything while *retaining hit points*, just as a design challenge.)<br/><br/>OK, so:<br/><br/>With D&amp;D hit points, we have all the issues listed above, but also a potentially unfortunate issue where <i>what we describe doesn't matter</i>. I can describe sticking a knife into your arms or into your ribs, slicing or stabbing, from above or below, and, as far as the system is concerned, it's all the same. The only way we can reconcile the two is either to keep things abstract ("You're firing shot after shot at the president, but he seems to be still standing!") or to narrate only AFTER the results are known ("Oh! You rolled a 5 for damage? Sounds like you shot him straight through the heart!").<br/><br/>However, in either case, describing the action in any detail is not really necessary, often problematic, and therefore easy to simply omit from play. "You hit him and deal 5 damage" works great. "I'm kneeling low and shooting an arrow into his eye!" - that doesn't.<br/><br/>I really wanted to see if we could change that. Can we still use hit points and make a game which is based on description, detailed narration, and have those things matter?<br/><br/>That's what I was going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454478/#Comment_454478" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T22:15:30+00:00" title="July  1, 2016 10:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, in this hack:<br/><br/>We're using Dungeon World or some similar ruleset, which we can use to determine whether someone gets hit or not. However, it also makes things relatively safe for the player, so the MC can feel to narrate harm in detail. In a fight, when it's the MC's turn to make a hard move, she simply narrates a hit, as appropriate to the fiction.<br/><br/>That settles our issues with "did he get hit, or not?". We *know*, every time.<br/><br/>Hit points under this hack are VERY obviously not representative of anything - they are purely abstract, and there is nothing about the ruleset which implies otherwise. There's no chance for misunderstanding or disagreement: the rules never put us in a position where that's an issue (e.g. the assassination of the president).<br/><br/>This solves some other issues, like not knowing whether someone was hurt or not or what kind of damage has been dealt. <br/><br/>We have no issues with things like Armor Class - again, we always know if someone's been hit, so that whole conundrum is no issue.<br/><br/>In this hack, the way hit points interact with the harm move apply equally to an incredibly wide range of effects and situations. We can effortlessly use them for poisons, mind control, curses, maybe even disease, grappling, attempts to kill, attempts to knock out, spells which make you go insane, and so on. This is very appealing to me; this kind of flexibility allows us to venture boldly into all kinds of game territory with great ease.<br/><br/>The detail of narration not only *matters* a great deal, but the system is dependent on it. For instance, if I get hit in a fight, I literally *cannot* proceed until I have some idea of what actually happened. In D&amp;D it's sufficient to say, "you got hit, take off 5 hit points". In this game, we can't do that. I have no idea how many hit points to spend or which options to choose until I hear a description of what happened. The narration here is vitally important, and can't be skipped, even accidentally! We need those details; the game thrives on them.<br/><br/>That fulfills the descriptive criteria in a way which not only often is <i>unnecessary</i> with D&amp;D-style hit points but can even be <i>actively harmful</i>. <br/><br/>Similarly, since the hit points are abstract and only interact with the resist harm move, we never have a target who is utterly invincible or ridiculously fragile. The right attack can kill anyone at any time (well, at least so long as we maintain a cap on how many points are spent on a given roll, anyway, which is easy to do if that's desired), but a weak attack against someone with no hit points is no more scary than otherwise: a punch in the arm is still a punch in the arm. The "last" hit point has no special value which makes it different from the second-to-last hit point. That punch can't kill anyone unless we have explicitly decided that it should, for some reason. It will never break our suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Further, the resist harm and recovery moves *always* tell us important details about the action happening, such as whether the character is hampered by the injury and whether it could be troublesome later. (Things which I find are generally awkward to make rulings on in D&amp;D, requiring something like the injury table to adjudicate fairly.) We know whether the character is in a position to retaliate, whether they are immediately affected by the injury or not, and so on (which makes it great for dealing with a variety of effects, as well, like firing a magical spiderweb at someone).<br/><br/>So, that's how I see it in action.<br/><br/>I do not consider it a perfect ruleset by any means - it has a number of issues, including a certain awkwardness to using armour and/or healing, potential difficulties determining whether an attack is lethal, and the mathematical issue of breakpoints we've been discussing. But it's just the first draft.<br/><br/>It's also not as helpful from the GM-side. We could potentially use it as written for the GM, as well, if we wanted to, however, and it would work just fine.<br/><br/>Does that answer your questions, or not yet?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454482/#Comment_454482" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T00:04:21+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 12:04AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 12:14AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (And now I've caught up with your "How does D&amp;D5E have teeth?" topic, which, oddly enough, is precisely about this.

I think I finally get how your hack does this though, Paul (you probably already get this but I want to write it out anyway to see if it helps clear confusion).<br/><br/>Essentially the harm suffered is found in the choices we don't pick. Let's say I get punched in the arm and roll a 7-9. If I think about my options on that list, I can pretty safely choose the +1 forward because a punch in the arm which is as bad as it seems will most likely be a bruise, and maybe it hinders me in this battle because it hurts a bit \u2013 maybe a -1 to Defy Danger+CON.<br/><br/>If I get bitten in half by a dragon and roll a 7-9, let's once again say I pick the +1 forward. In this case it's as bad as it seems because I get torn in half and I'm dead, and it's going to hinder me for the rest of the battle because I'm out, I'm dead.<br/><br/>I think this places a big responsibility on the GM to describe in full the harm being suffered. Really, the GM should already be thinking of the potential outcomes and endeavour to communicate them to the player. I think this is where some of the disconnect from other sorts of mechanics comes in. Usually I'd say "the goblin thrusts its spear at you", roll to hit, roll damage, and then say either "the spear's blade scratches along your ribcage" or "the spear plunges into your chest" depending on damage dealt.<br/><br/>Whereas for this hack, instead I'd say either "the spear's blade scratches along your ribcage" or "the spear plunges into your chest" and then the player rolls and decides what to do with that information \u2013 and I have to go to the injury first otherwise the player won't know what to do, as a spear coming at them could mean any number of things and also doesn't activate the rule.<br/><br/>So, a question for you, Paul. How do you, the GM, determine whether the spear grazed a character or stabbed them? There's a risk for a GM of becoming someone who arbitrarily hands out death, which all the various rolls in to-hit/damage systems take responsibility for instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andye" title="Andye"><img alt="Andye" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andye">Andye</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454485/#Comment_454485" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T00:50:41+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 12:50AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get setting up with a soft move, like "the goblin charges at you with its spear raised" but how do I decide the hardness of the next move in a way which is fair, considering that there's lots of different possible harm risks which the player could be reading in that moment.<br/><br/>Also I had a thought about armour \u2013 what if armour gave you an extra choice on the list (e.g on a 7-9 choose two, on a 10+ choose 3, etc.) but also added an extra option to the list: "-your armour isn't damaged".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454486/#Comment_454486" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T00:58:48+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 12:58AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 12:59AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's exactly right, Andye.<br/><br/>There are three things here:<br/><br/>1. It's IS a little bit challenging for the GM to hit the right level of description to clearly telegraph the danger of the injury but also to leave a little wiggle room for the choices made. I think this is a very "learnable" skill, however (not that different from other GM-description duties in RPGs, tricky but manageable).<br/><br/>For instance, consider the president in our example being shot with a poisoned arrow. I would say something like, "You hear a whistling noise, and suddenly there is a feathered shaft sticking out of your arm - a bright pain in your arm, but also something else, something unfamiliar... is it a burning sensation?"<br/><br/>Then we'd go to the dice.<br/><br/>On a bad roll, the character is on the ground, dying from poison. On a good roll, it turns out the arrow is stuck in his armour or sleeve, and just grazed his arm. There is the stinging sensation from the poison, but only a drop of it got into his system, and he shrugs it off. On a medium roll, he can clench his teeth and go on, but perhaps his arm isn't working any more. Or he ignores the pain and fights, but will be in danger of succumbing to the poison once the fight is over.<br/><br/>(Which reminds me: it might also be good to put in a "give in to the pain" option, instead of rolling at all. That way you choose whether you want to 'resist the pain', or just take the blow and concede defeat. I like that conceptually, but I don't have a good way of representing it mechanically just yet. Perhaps it could be as simple as a bonus on the recovery roll, however.)<br/><br/>2.  The system is pretty forgiving for the PCs, so the GM/MC should feel free to play pretty hard, and just narrate more-or-less the harshest kind of harm which "feels right". Note that in the example above, I said it hit his arm. I could have said chest, instead; but I think the extra wiggle room is such that the MC can "disclaim responsibility" and simply narrate what seems right fictionally. (In this case, I guess I didn't picture the archer as supernaturally skilled!) <br/><br/>The idea is that the MC can be brave and let the system worry about the consequences.<br/><br/>3. When should an attack actually be *deadly*, however? That's a more tricky one. I hashed out a number of possible solutions earlier in the thread. Here are my two favourites thus far:<br/><br/>a) Any attack which would plausibly be lethal is assumed to be. An arrow? Yeah, definitely. But if only your leg was exposed and it hit you in the calf, then probably not (unless the character doesn't take care of the wound and spends the night in the swamp, then it probably gets infected, right?).<br/><br/>In other words, always *assume* that a wound is lethal, unless it simply isn't plausible that it would be.<br/><br/>b) Assign any given monster or attack a "deadliness" rating, from 2 to 12. If the "resist harm" roll doesn't beat the "deadliness" rating, the attack threatens to be lethal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andye" title="Andye"><img alt="Andye" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andye">Andye</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454487/#Comment_454487" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T01:48:11+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  1:48AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul - so whether the spear sticks you or scrapes you really depends on the result of the roll and the choice made by the player. I can see that working if you describe the wound in terms of feeling, rather than specifics. E.g. "the spear sticks you in the side - there is an intense, sharp pain and you feel hot blood pouring down your flank" then after the roll it can turn out that the spear just nicked you.<br/><br/>As for lethality, I guess there are two categories of attack - lethal, and non-lethal. Then there are effectively two categories of response to an attack - I suffer it now, or I suffer it later (or both, or neither). You could make a table of possible outcomes.<br/><br/><b>Lethal</b><br/>- If I suffer it now, then I'm out of the fight, presumed dead, but it wasn't as bad as it seemed, so I don't have to roll to recover.<br/>- If I suffer it later, then I can keep fighting, but I'll have to roll to see if I succumb to my injuries later (activating your second rule).<br/><br/><b>Non-lethal</b><br/>- If I suffer it now, then I'm disadvantaged for the fight - maybe I lose my weapon, or I get a bad knock to the head - but after the fight I'll be right as rain.<br/>- If I suffer it later, then I ignore the pain for now, but after the fight I'll be at a disadvantage - maybe I have trouble remembering things, or something important in my pack got broken.<br/><br/>Maybe each time you choose to keep fighting against lethal damage, you get a -1 to your later roll to recover, and if you choose to just let the attack drop you then you get +1 to your later roll to recover.<br/><br/>Also did you read my suggestion about how to work in armour?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454490/#Comment_454490" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T06:07:46+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  6:07AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are pretty good thoughts!<br/><br/>Your "non-lethal" examples sound <i>overly</i> non-lethal to me (after all, taking an arrow through the leg can be "non-lethal" too, depending on how you want to look at it!)  but otherwise, yeah, good stuff.<br/><br/>Your observation on describing the *sensations* of the attack (or other sensory details, like the sounds, smells, or collateral damage) is particularly good!<br/><br/>In some genres, stuff like "you're thrown clear through a brick wall and the building collapses around you" is very applicable, too.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454492/#Comment_454492" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T06:40:01+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  6:40AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 6:41AM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does that answer your questions, or not yet?</blockquote>\nNo, it completely sidestepped all my questions <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Plus, reopened old ones that I had already answered. I'll deal with them first<br/>\n<blockquote>Ok, right. Fate Core. I remember now: you enter a conflict, and then you can "take" hits to your stress track (basically hit points, except that they don't always add together), or take them as consequence. If you are unwilling or unable, you lose the conflict, instead.<br/><br/>I like this approach, and I think it's good, but it's very "meta". We're dealing with positioning numbers on a sheet, balancing advantage against disadvantage, and so on. Here, I wanted to create something really different.</blockquote>\nRight, the whole stress track thing isn't the best but the fact that you get real consequences, that's good, right?<br/>\n<blockquote>So, issues with D&amp;D hit points:</blockquote>\nBut there are no issues with D&amp;D hit points, what I wanted to know is how the hack's hitpoints are better!\n<blockquote>It's not clear what they represent. Luck, physical toughness, fatigue, armour, etc, etc. Lots of overlapping concepts create the potential for misunderstanding. (Although that can be circumvented by a group that has a very disciplined approach, like your fairly clear stance that "no one gets hit until their hit points are depleted". Still, there are fuzzy areas - you're fighting a Giant Ooze in a right corridor, and you're going to tell me that bringing down its hit points does NOT mean it's getting hit?)</blockquote>\nIt's shying away from the hits! "Oh, fire really seems to be scaring it!"<br/>Also, <em>especially</em> for monsters, we can put in some real harm in the HP in some situations. We just found that we almost never have to do this or that it usually doesn't become better.\n<blockquote>Not knowing what they represent means that rules for things like poisons and healing are generally inconsistent or, similarly, wildly abstract. (e.g. Why is a healing spell more effective on a weak character than a strong character?)</blockquote>\nIt's not?\n<blockquote>"To-hit" rolls do NOT actually help us figure out whether someone was hit or not. "Missing" can mean the person dodged; but so can losing some hit points. We just don't know!</blockquote>\nWe even know <em>more</em> actually. In both cases the person dodged but if HP had to be involved, it was a close call and some of the "nine lives of the cat" had to become involved, the Gods had to have been smiling.\n<blockquote>Armor class, similarly, does not help us decide whether someone actually got hit or not. You can have a high AC because you're very agile, or because you're very sturdy, and they're handled the same way. Especially if you add them together, again, we get no help from the system in terms of imagining what's actually happening.</blockquote>\nThis is something I've described as the "scoff factor" or defense capabilities. You are unaffected by the attack and I typically describe it using the most agential factor in that character's AC. If they have cast mage armor, I say "your magical bindings protect you" and if they have a high dexterity I say "you dodge it" or "quickly parry it"&gt;<br/><br/>What AC gives us is one roll. AC + HP replaces skill + dodge/parry + pd + dr + hp from GURPS. Fast and easy.\n<blockquote>Finally, removing hit points may or may not mean you got hit, and we have no way to determine which.</blockquote>\nTrue but that's why the moves and attacks have this hardcoded in, such as the vampire's claws vs the vampire's bite.<br/><br/>The default is that you did not get hit. Having a strong default solves so much.\n<blockquote>Hit points can make some people "invincible" when they shouldn't be (e.g. assassinating the president). Sometimes we don't mind this and we roll with the punches; sometimes we have to make house rules or rulings to make things work out.</blockquote>\nRemember that your example also stated that the assassinator to be using an instantly-killing, never-missing, magical rifle. To even put such an item in the game, the item would require sidestepping AC/HP just like Power Word Kill spell does.\n<blockquote>Hit points can make people extremely fragile when they shouldn't be. (You have 1 hit point left, and some punches you in the arm. Depending on the edition of D&amp;D, this could leave you dead, unconscious or with a weird injury like "missing an eye".)</blockquote>\nSo the person turned around in the last second and got smashed in the eye. Or, the attacker used the "I hit to knock" rule which bypasses death saves and injury tables but doesn't work with ranged weapons. (Yes, I readily admit that one huge problem with D&amp;D is the large amount of exceptions and weird rules that are in there! The book captures them well in 4 pages but that's 40 sentences too much!)<br/><br/>OK, now I'm done with the re-answering old questions part. Now I turn to my own questions:\n<blockquote>Now, I named this thread a "A <i>Descriptive</i> Damage Hack". What makes AW-based games somewhat interesting to a lot of people is that the rules make the description *really matter*. I wanted to bring the importance of the description happening at the table to the forefront with these rules.</blockquote>\nAnd how does it do this? What does it that makes this work? <blockquote>(Would that be even better without hit points at all? Definitely, and I've developed rules along those lines before, like here<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. But in this case I was curious if I could accomplish anything while *retaining hit points*, just as a design challenge.)</blockquote>\nRight and I'm not knocking any of the other approaches but I'm kinda skeptical towards this one.<br/>This one seems that it can also be susceptible to the assasssination president issue but worse:<br/>The presidents spend hit points and shrug off both the harm rolls (resist harm and the second one).<br/><br/>Now we have a president that unlike in "my vision" <em>has</em> actually been shot, but still is just standing there delivering the state of the nation laughing at the wound.<br/><br/>Secondly, your aim seems to have been to severely redefine HP -- retaining their unclear name and all their historical baggage of many meanings over the years, but trying to severely change their mechanics.<br/><br/>So, the design still needs work to solve the challenge (and solving challenges just for the sake of solving them, even though there would be better solutions if you ditch some of the requirements, I'm all for. Love a good design challenge) because the HP as they seem mess up the descriptions and clarity and everything you're skeptical about in the D&amp;D approach, yet the HP are utterly unfamiliar. So, neither part of the challenge met, so far?\n<blockquote>Hit points under this hack are VERY obviously not representative of anything - they are purely abstract, and there is nothing about the ruleset which implies otherwise. There's no chance for misunderstanding or disagreement: the rules never put us in a position where that's an issue (e.g. the assassination of the president).</blockquote>\nBut why not then use a vision in D&amp;D where they're not representative of anything either?<br/>We don't have these misunderstandings or disagreements in our group either and we even <i>have</i> a representation.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454493/#Comment_454493" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T06:40:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  6:40AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 6:42AM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, NOW time for the questions:\n<blockquote>This solves some other issues, like not knowing whether someone was hurt or not or what kind of damage has been dealt. </blockquote>\nHow does it solve it?\n<blockquote>We have no issues with things like Armor Class - again, we always know if someone's been hit, so that whole conundrum is no issue.</blockquote>\nHow does it do that?\n<blockquote>In this hack, the way hit points interact with the harm move apply equally to an incredibly wide range of effects and situations. We can effortlessly use them for poisons, mind control, curses, maybe even disease, grappling, attempts to kill, attempts to knock out, spells which make you go insane, and so on. This is very appealing to me; this kind of flexibility allows us to venture boldly into all kinds of game territory with great ease.</blockquote>\nHow does it do that?<br/>+ For most lot of those we use saves. And saves are also the flexible bold territory thing for us.<br/>AC/HP makes normal fights exciting while still being fightable instead of insta-death affairs (although in practice they usually do die pretty quickly)<br/>Saves make the more exotic dangers workable.\n<blockquote>The detail of narration not only *matters* a great deal, but the system is dependent on it. For instance, if I get hit in a fight, I literally *cannot* proceed until I have some idea of what actually happened.</blockquote>\nHow does the mechanics of the hack ensure that?\n<blockquote>In D&amp;D it's sufficient to say, "you got hit, take off 5 hit points". In this game, we can't do that. I have no idea how many hit points to spend or which options to choose until I hear a description of what happened. The narration here is vitally important, and can't be skipped, even accidentally! We need those details; the game thrives on them.</blockquote>\nBut what if they're too gory?<br/>Hence "It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye" vision.<br/>+ wouldn't it take ten hours like a GURPS fight does with it's one second rounds and three rolls per round per player?<br/><br/>So here are some other examples of our games:<br/>DM: "They are stuck in the web but they can reach you with the hillebards, and they're trying to clobber you with them."<br/>DM drops eight d20's on the table, two for each guard taking the lowest in each dice pair<br/>DM: "You lose 16 HP"<br/>Player: "OK, that's no problem" <em>or</em><br/>Player: "Holy shit, those hillebards are looking sharper than I thought, it's getting close!" <em>or</em><br/>Player: "They hit me! I'm down"<br/><br/>That example demonstrated how AC and HP interacted to represent how dangerous the hillebards were to the player.<br/><br/>Next example:<br/><br/>DM: "OK so some flying brains come out and start zapping at you with their eye rays. Gidil, make a wis save and a dex save. DC 15"<br/>Player picks up a black and an orange d20, points at one of them<br/>Player: "This one's wis"<br/>Player the two dice on the table<br/>Player: "I fail the dex"<br/>DM: "You are paralyzed!"<br/><br/>That example demonstrated how there are many other types of attack not just the vanilla HP/AC attacks.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454494/#Comment_454494" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T06:45:51+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  6:45AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just came up with this:<br/>The space suit could have its own HP!

I mean, I've played D&amp;D like that, and it was fun. But with this hack, I'm going for something very, very different.<br/><br/>Notice how those descriptions in your examples are all very vague and abstract? Well, that's been put on you by the system. Try to get more concrete and it <i>fights you</i>. With this thing I'm going for, it's the very opposite.<br/><br/>They also highlight the hit point weirdness I was talking about before: high-HP characters have absolutely no problem dodging a good number of polearm clobberings, or flying arrows, but those flying-brain-zappers, somehow they can't dodge those as well.<br/><br/>(E.g. If I have 50 hit points, I know that I can "dodge" about 10 arrows no problem before I'm in any danger. However, if they are attacks which have an "on-hit" trigger or use saves, suddenly I have no more immunity at all - we're operating on an entirely different paradigm, where I could fall with the first hit or I could theoretically dodge an infinite number of them - which I can't do with the arrows - for no apparent reason. Now, again, <i>of course</i> we can rationalize this in play. I've played D&amp;D for years and we all did it very successfully. But I'm tired of that now; I want cleaner, more elegant design which doesn't require that I rationalize system oddities away when I'm playing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454499/#Comment_454499" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T07:01:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  7:01AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (How would the space suit HP work?

The ogre hits you. Do you want to <i>resist harm</i>?" tells me less than the 9 points sentence do.<br/>That's sort of the point... you thought the webbed-guards-with-halberds example was low info? It even details how dangerous they are, exactly how scary they are, exactly, quantified to the nearest digit, how tiring it is to fight them.<br/><br/>You missed that roll. The ogre hits you. Do you want to <i>resist harm</i>?<br/>No? or Yes?<br/>Those are the only two options, I guess? I have no context for what's going on, for what's at stake, for what I have to do. I also don't understand what resisting harm means diegetically -- I understand that it does mean something in the "dice" world, to roll to resist harm and then later to roll to recover.<br/><br/>Whereas at my table... "Oh, shit, she can <i>that</i> easily meet my AC? and I lose <i>nine</i>HP? Folks, maybe it's time for us to run!"<br/><i>or</i><br/>"Nine? That's all? OK, I don't have to waste slots on this sucker, conserve your arrows and crossbow bolts, folks, I've got this!"<br/><br/>The hack is sort of the worst of both worlds.<br/>In Dungeon World, it's all about the positioning. You narrate in detail your footing, your movement, your attacks, your aspirations, your advantages, you get separated, your gear breaks, the club comes bearing down on you -- what do you do?<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, it's quantified, strict, you know what you've got and what it costs to stay in the fight, every fight is mechanically different and <i>you</i> change as you grow more experienced and the fates smile evermore on you.<br/><br/>In the hack... where's the agency? Where's the narration/description? Show it!<br/>The example -- even more so now that you doubled down on it -- is as cold and mechanical and disassociated as D&amp;D as its worst and visionlessest, and as vague and subjective and DM-whim-ruled as DW at its worst and flummiest.<br/><br/>OMG how harsh I sound now, and against one of my favorite posters no less -- but I'm not saying this is inherently the case with the hack. It's the example I'm criticizing, not your design chops. I'm just saying: Show me how the hack can work, show me how it can fly -- or go back to the drawing board.<br/><br/><br/>I was proud over the halberd-fight <i>because</i> how it summarized so much so concisely. In accordance with the "all fun and games until someone falls down" ideal. Footing, hope, will to live, luck, fatigue, tiredness, braveness -- all rolled up in a couple of numbers. <br/><br/>Similarly, with: "Ok, it's the ogre's turn." *clatter clatter* "The ogre hits you for 9 points of damage. What do you do?"<br/>I know what's going on. The ogre is causing me <i>quantifiable</i> distress.<br/>[Concession: the whole "it's our turn, it's the monsters turn, it's our turn" -- that sucks and all my efforts to the contrary, that's something that has re-reared its ugly head time and time again at our table. But that's a complete side discussion compared to the question of how the ogre's attack itself is narrated.]<br/><br/>[Also concession: terminology: the whole "hits you for" and that HP loss is still called "damage", that's very hard to shake. At our table, we <i>have</i> done a reasonable job, and have kept it at bay somewhat (not perfect) but at that point it's drifted pretty far from mainstream D&amp;D play -- however, the hack is in a bit of a glass house in this regard, retaining some of the more confusing terminology. + it's no big deal. It <i>is</i> damage -- to fatigue, to luck, to hope.]<br/><br/>So what do I say, what's the next sentence? No I guess?

You see, that was precisely the point I was trying to make:<br/><br/>If the GM doesn't describe the action, you *can't* make your decision. You must decide:<br/><br/>* Will I resist harm? (Optionally; as written, you'd always do so - either works)<br/>* How many hit points do I spend?<br/>* Which options do I choose?<br/><br/>*None* of those things - not a single one - make <i>any</i> sense at all until you know exactly what's happening.<br/><br/>This means that, for the game to go on, the player must then go:<br/><br/>"Well, how did the ogre hit me? Where? Did it hurt?"<br/><br/>If the ogre slapped me with a wet noodle, I'm not going to waste my time or spend my hit points. If he stabbed me with a spear, I'd still want to ask, "Where? How deep? Does it look bad? Is it a big spear or a little spear?"<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D example, we subtract 9 hit points, and we're ready to move on. Next thing! I could ask for more detail, but not only is it redundant but it could even screw things (since, as I've shown, digging for more details causes inconsistencies to appear).<br/><br/>Here, we literally cannot move forward without describing - and in some detail - what's happening. The players have every incentive to describe things, and to ask for others to describe in more detail, as well.<br/><br/>That's why we'll never have any of that D&amp;D-esque ambiguity about whether someone was hit or not, whether they were injured or not, etc, etc.<br/><br/>So the hack supports a very "live", dynamic, heavily descriptive way of playing, much like Dungeon World does... up until we get to the hit points thing. I tried to build in that same approach to playing to the "getting hurt" phase.<br/><br/>It's precisely the thing Vincent was talking about in his article on "with teeth".<br/><br/>The design funnels you quite naturally into a very descriptive mode where we create rich fiction, detailed and tangible. We can't play without doing that - if we accidentally forget, the system prompts us right back into it.<br/><br/>On a sidenote, I also think it contributes more detail on the 'other end' of the process:<br/><br/>There's also the flexibility of the whole thing, which makes it very economical, which I enjoy. For instance, let's say I have a flying brain which zaps people with a paralysis ray. In D&amp;D, we have to make up new rules for that, and then reference them and follow them. We sometimes get weirdness, like how come it's easier to dodge something which deals hp damage than something which takes a saving throw, unless your luck is running low and you've been fighting for a while, in which case it's easier to dodge something which takes a saving throw... but I suppose that's not the end of the world.<br/><br/>But look here, with this hack:<br/><br/>As GM, all I have to do is describe a paralysis ray and how it hits the character and makes them feel all tingly (or whatever).<br/><br/>Then we roll the "resist harm", and we find out, say, that it paralyzes them for a moment, but then they can shake it off for now - however, it will affect them after the fight's over. Now the character shakes it off and finishes the fight. After, as the adrenaline wears off, they find themselves losing feeling and going numb...<br/><br/>We feed them some magical stimulant and roll to "recover". They make a full recovery, perhaps, or, on a 7-9, it's only partial: ok, you can move about freely now, but your left leg still isn't working quite right.<br/><br/>To me, that's a big draw.

Sorry if it came across that way! I thought my example would put you in the mindset of the player, which quite naturally leads to asking, "Well, where did I get hit? How hard? With what kind of weapon"  (Or some variation thereof, depending on what you, particularly, are concerned about.)<br/><br/>As for the "inconsistencies", I thought you agreed that the various examples we've discussed (like the president's assassination) are problematic? In any case, I can very safely say that *for me* they were a constant bother when I played D&amp;D. Enough that I quite playing my favourite game! I'm pretty sure I would never have sought out other RPGs if this didn't come up in our D&amp;D games, over and over again.<br/><br/>When it comes to the paralysis beam example, what I was trying to show was the flexibility of this simple rule. In D&amp;D, you must have special rules for a paralysis beam - its effects, how we determine whether it hits, and how we determine whether it takes effect. For example, we might use a saving throw instead of a to-hit roll. A fireball might have a different rule, and a dragon's breath yet another rule, and so on. We can use these rules for all kinds of things, though, zooming in and out, including mental illness or some kind of curse.<br/><br/>(And that's another example of something that bothered me: if I use my AC to dodge an arrow, but my saving throw to dodge a paralysis beam, what do we do if it's an arrow which is made of a piece of a paralysis beam? There's no consistent solution to this kind of thing. I still love (old-school) D&amp;D for a basic dungeon crawl, where these aren't important issues so long as we can agree on a ruling and stick to it, but in other forms of gaming it ruins things for me completely.)<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to your other comments, you might have to rephrase them, because you've lost me completely. For instance, why is it that you feel "emotion" at losing 9 hit points (D&amp;D hit points), but not when you spend the same 9 hit points on a "resist harm" roll? They seem pretty much the same to me - if you're moved by the idea that your luck is running out, it's the same either way, no? Your reserve is running down, and you know eventually you'll be left without any.<br/><br/>Your comments about a lack of hooks and detail to build on are completely baffling to me! I feel like I've been demonstrating in example after example how that is precisely the opposite of the case. <br/><br/>Back to the ogre example: in D&amp;D, when we make our combat rolls, we establish firmly that some fighting has taken place, and that the ogre has done *something* active which has caused our hero's "luck reserve" to diminish. Other than that, we know *nothing*.<br/><br/>Using a hack like this one, we simply cannot follow through the procedure without establishing how the ogre is attacking, with what weapon, where he hit the hero, and how hard. Then the system gives us an output in terms of what effect the injury has on the hero, which we can use to build more detail about the circumstances. This means that we *will* know precisely whether or not the ogre has hit the hero, where, with what weapon, whether the hero was knocked back or incapacitated or took it like a champ, etc, etc.<br/><br/>(An obvious example: hero is charging towards a door, trying to escape from the room, and he is hit by the ogre. In D&amp;D, all we know is that the "luck reserve" has been reduced. In this hack, we know whether his "momentum or position is maintained", telling us whether he can barrel through this injury or he's knocked flat on his ass somehow (again, the description of the attack will give us the specifics here), so we know whether he reaches that door or not. (I know some versions of D&amp;D have special rules for being knocked prone if dealt a certain amount of damage and stuff like that - but now again we have the problem of reconciling "knocked prone" with "I thought losing hit points meant you dodged the attack?"))<br/><br/>All these things add to the flavour and the description of the imaginary scene taking place.<br/><br/>Your objections:\n<blockquote><br/>In hack -- roll defy danger+dex. Then roll resist harm+4. Then roll recover harm+4<br/>1. Rote, "sheet first" play. No teeth.<br/>2. Slow -- Many rolls for one blow<br/>3. GM whim rules. Why is leg numb? Why not shoulder? Why not tongue?<br/>4. Too action hero, ignoring wounds<br/></blockquote>\n1. This has lost me entirely. Didn't I just demonstrate that you *cannot* play this "sheet first"? It simply doesn't work like that - you need vivid description for it to function at all.<br/>2. This is a very fair criticism - it's definitely slower, and quite intentionally so. It's supposed to add detail to help us imagine what's going on, instead of skipping through it. I wouldn't use this hack in any game where someone gets hit five times in every single fight, for example.<br/>3. This is also fair. The goal of the hack is not convenience or speed, nor is it fair adjudication. It is, rather, focused on description, a rich fiction, and detailed "colour". It frees up the players to add a great deal of detail to what's happening in play and then gives that "teeth". You lose a bit of objectivity, but it frees you up to follow your imagination and trust that the system can handle that, much like AW moves do.<br/>4. Also fair! But that's as intended (and also true of D&amp;D - neither ruleset is exactly a gritty and realistic approach to the effects of wounds on a combatant!).<br/><br/>For example, why was the person's leg still numb after the paralysis? Well, we would have established that the paralysis ray hit them in the leg, or something similar - we follow the fiction and its logic. (And that, again, is why we'd have to establish details. I'm not going to spend the full 4 hit points until I know where I'm hit - for example, if my survival depends on me being able to run away, I need full use of my legs, but I might decide I can handle a paralyzed arm under the current circumstances without a problem.)<br/><br/>I hope that helps! I'm really at a loss as to how I can explain this any differently, but feel free to ask more questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454541/#Comment_454541" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T04:52:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  4:52AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2016 4:55AM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Problems: I wouldn't exactly call something that's come up <i>once</i> (the dragon's eye) "constantly".<br/>Different rule: Saving throw is the normal rule and AC/HP is the special case.

The hack doesn't contribute.<br/>You say you've given examples\u2026 did you mean the space suit one?<br/>Your biggest example was one that you left deliberately sparse; that's not an example of the hack working as intended.

Player B keeps you in a jar?<br/><br/>Listen, in Dice&amp;Clouds terms, D&amp;D has too high proportion of left-facing arrows (ideally there should be a mix) but at least there <em>are</em> a lot of arrows! So far, what I've seen of the hack, there's a high degree of disconnect/disassociation.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D:<br/>DM: An ogre is coming towards you, its club is bearing down on you<br/>Player A: help, help!<br/>Player B: I'm busy working on the locks<br/>Hook number one: DMs, you can't just deal out harm, make a roll<br/>If player win:<br/>DM: Your shield protected you against the club!<br/>If ogre win:<br/>Hook number two: DMs, you can't just crush them into bone powder, look at the damage stat<br/>DM: lose 9 HP<br/>Player: Oh, I only had 7<br/>DM: Ok, everything goes black as the club hits you, make death saves<br/>Player: I fail the first one<br/>DM: And since it's next to you, it can give you two automatic failures as it smashes you a second time.

I thought it was obvious, but perhaps I should have spelled it out:<br/><br/>You, as the GM, do not narrate Effect. (That's what you did in your example, above, and why it ends up sounding dumb.) You stop your description at Execution. However, you must provide sufficient detail for the player to get a sense of the possible Effect, or the player doesn't know what to do. The player will therefore rightly ask you for more detail, which is how the hack "provides" descriptive richness. <br/><br/>Then we roll the dice, and that's when Effect is established.<br/><br/>So, example time:<br/><br/>GM: An ogre is approaching you, swinging a mace and an axe!<br/>Player: [some sequence of events which ends with him getting hit - like failing a Defy Danger roll or just sitting there and not doing anything, or whatever]<br/>The GM now consults what she knows of the fiction and narrates what seems like a most likely/believable attack on the PC: "While you're fiddling with the locks, the ogre brings down his weapon on your left shoulder!"<br/><br/><i>(As a sidenote, having the ogre attack and then "miss" or "bounce off the character's shield" - an obstacle the ogre could see the whole time, and which the character isn't using to defend himself - is a perfect example of the kind of thing which would come up all the time when I played D&amp;D and drive me bonkers. How the hell did this stupid ogre not, you know, aim at an exposed body part? Especially considering that a "combat round" should be more than enough time for the ogre to batter this poor sod into dirt, not <br/>ineffectively bang against his shield.)</i><br/><br/>Anyway, the player must now decide what to do. It's a pretty tense situation, and he doesn't have a ton of hit points to spare, so he will quite naturally ask the GM some questions. "Wait! Is the ogre attacking me with the mace or the axe? In other words, am I facing the potential of broken bones or an amputated arm?" "Is this a glancing blow, or a solid hit?" And so on.<br/><br/>In the process, we'll establish a good deal of detail about the attack and what it looks like. Let's say the GM says that the ogre is swinging his mace into the character from above, with all his strength behind it. ("How strong is an ogre, anyway?" "Oh, a blow like this could easily shatter shields and crush bones!")<br/><br/>Ok, now the player is ready to roll. He spends some hit points (probably as many as he can, unless he wants to save some for the recovery roll, which would be a safer bet). Let's say he rolls a 9. His options, now:<br/><br/>1. He can choose to react immediately, acting decisively (maybe to get out of there, or open the lock after all? the character certainly wants to do *something*). However, then his shoulder/arm will be crushed, broken, and effectively out of commission. (We can easily agree that the arm being useless now AND later means it's probably broken, or something similar.)<br/>2. He can choose "the wound doesn't hamper me for now" - this means that he is knocked off-balance and definitely doesn't get to carry through the lock-picking, but the arm is still temporarily functional. However, after the adrenaline of the fight wears off, it won't be working very well. We can read this in different ways, but maybe it's a less severe break, so the arm still works up until it swells up? We work together to establish something like that, when the fight is over (likely just a GM narration).<br/>3. He can choose "you got lucky; you find out later that it wasn't as big a deal as it seemed". This tells us that the blow was heavy enough to cost him his "momentum or position" (perhaps this means he is knocked clean away from the door altogether), and temporarily useless. Again, we narrate some detail here: perhaps the arm is numbed or dislocated, but after the fight we know this will wear off - which tells us that it's not broken! The blow glanced off his armour, or he managed to turn so as to minimize the damage, or something similar.<br/><br/>All these options have clear implications for what the damage looks like, how it affects the victim in the moment, and what state the character will be in after the fight. (At which point we can also pull in the recovery move to get more detail - a failure there indicates it was definitely a major break, whereas a full success might mean it can be pretty easily patched up.)<br/><br/>It all shows that just sitting there and letting the ogre hit you is not a terribly good idea. <br/><br/>(Another perfect example of how D&amp;D's rules often create weirdness for me: I have to engage in some kind of bizarre mental gymnastics to figure out how a defenseless man picking a lock manages NOT to get hurt by an ogre swinging a massive weapon at him for a decent period of time. And that's a pretty regular occurence, in my experience.)<br/><br/>Contrast that to D&amp;D, where we might say, "Ok, mark off 9 hit points!" If we wish to get more information, first of all there is no incentive to do so, and, second, most of the things which seem logical will flat-out contradict what the system is telling us. (Like the ogre's attack bouncing off his shield, or hitting him but not hurting him - all have weird implications which we don't want to reliably hold true. For instance, if we set the precedent that it DOES mean a hit, that gets us in trouble with any situation where any kind of hit at all would be meaningful - such as poison, magical effects, sharp objects against fragile unarmoured targets, a duel to first blood, etc, etc.)<br/><br/>Again, I don't find that kind of thing *impossible* to resolve - of course we can, <i>especially</i> if we're willing to back up to an abstraction (as in your example, where we mark off the 9 hit points and just collectively take in the weight of the implied threat, despite an unchanged fictional situation). I just find it relatively uninspiring in terms of lacking fictional content, awkward for determining details (as with a poisoned arrow, or if it matters in the next scene whether the character has a visible wound or not), and difficult mentally because I have to jump through these hoops to make sure I don't violate some aspect of the rules with my narration.<br/><br/>Does this example help illustrate the rules in action?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454543/#Comment_454543" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T07:54:07+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  7:54AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sidenotes end up being all I want to talk about all the time\u2026 like how obv the ogre isn't slipping around on banana peels, the PC actively thwarted the attack, with a shield or with dodging.<br/>And also it is not significantly hurting the PC beyond what they can recover in one night. Poison with effects, space suits etc we've solved them already. We're going in circles. So it can't be a hard smash. The PC and the ogre arre fighting, each struggling to land a killing blow on the other. And what is a kiling or lingeringly injuring blow is determined by AC/HP. Until that happens it doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Now, you want the ogre to be able to overcome shields?<br/>Higher strength on the ogre will accomplish just that. Smashing harder = harder to dodge.<br/>Now, you want the ogre's blows to be more likely to be fight-endingly hard? Higher hp loss for the attacks will accomplish just that.<br/>It's countable, measurable, tangible.<br/>Uninspiring? Sure, but a lot more than the hack, which is all the same all the time.<br/>And\u2026 the default when you have a shield on, is that you defend yourself. (Being incapacitated is a special condition in 5e.) Similar to the Instincts in BW. In DW, otoh, with it's "to do it, do it" roots, you have to actively try to not get hurt, but you're handwaving that part in your examples which is confusing me -- and I take that as it's taxing to come up with creative, interesting ways to defend yourself.<br/><br/>But back to the main story, about the hack:<br/>How is the mechanic helping?<br/>It's not filling a purpose, it seems.<br/><br/><em>If</em> the resist/recover rolls are impactful, why even bother with things like axe vs mace, it's all leading to the same mechanic anyway?<br/>And if the mechanic is <em>not</em> impactful, why even have it? If it's all SIS based anyway? The ogre chop you, you're chopped. The ogre smashes you, you're smashed.<br/><br/>Or if it's a mix, how is the mix not weird? "The chopped arm works for now. Later, it falls off."<br/><br/>The extreme degree of power this system moves from gloracle to DM reminds me of the "crocodile story":<br/>Back when I was running no rules, no dice, all SIS, I had a giant, superbig, dire crocodile guarding a well. One player ran up to it. Fine, I said. "It kills you.<br/><br/>Nuh-uh!<br/><br/>Ok, then, it bites your arm off.<br/><br/>Nope, can't have that!<br/><br/>Ok, it tries to bite your arm of, it's gonna leave a scar.<br/><br/>Fine."<br/><br/>I don't want to go back to that. So that's problem number one. The hack disempowers the gloracle too much.<br/>Secondly, it's got that "putting people on the spot to be creative" thing that plagues many indie games. It's easy to be a boring player in DW and suck out all the fun and variety from the game. "Ogre chops at you" "I jump out of the way and roll defy danger" "Ogre smashes at you" "I jump out of the way and roll defy danger" "Ogre tries to catch you" "I jump out of the way and roll defy danger".<br/><br/>See, this is why I was so proud of the halberd guards example: all of the boring, business-as-usual, I-do-my-default-move of fights? D&amp;D allows you to do that quickly, rolling a bunch of dice. And when there are <em>interesting</em> moves, you zoom in.<br/>It's like the clang clang clang two clangs per second in a swashbuckling or chanbara movie, they go by quickly and then -- someone's taken out. And if you want to do interesting things, like first shoving them down and then getting advantage on the second attack, there's room for that and the game affords and creates such moments.<br/>In DW, you have to bring the awesome, in D&amp;D, there's room for the awesome you bring but sometimes awesome just happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454544/#Comment_454544" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T08:20:18+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  8:20AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2016 8:51AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Ah, I misread your earlier example. I thought it was the character who was under attack who said, "No, I'm busy picking the locks." Hope that helps explain why no one's defending themselves in my example, and why it made no sense to me!)<br/><br/>Does the hack "disempower the gloracle"? Well, yes - in the same way that AW and DW do. That's not a surprise, and I've mentioned it a few times myself.<br/><br/>However, I don't see how it's the same as a "Crocodile" situation. It very explicitly empowers the MC/GM to narrate whatever attack they feel is appropriate - there are no "takebacks". I say the ogre brings down his mace on your head, you blow the "resist" roll, you're dead.<br/><br/>If you don't like detailed fiction, making judgement calls, and "being on the spot to be creative", you won't like this hack (as, indeed, it seems you do not). If you like all those things, however, it supports that style of play very well.<br/><br/>I think you're trying to read it is a "rules-first" mechanic, when it's more of a "read the fiction and adjudicate results from there" mechanic. <br/><br/>For the record, I still have no idea how to solve the poisoned arrows with effects and space suits dilemmas in a way that's consistent - *unless* all I care about are the game's abstractions, which, as I said before, is totally fine, but a very different kind of game. (For instance, I can accept that a magical arrow requires a saving throw, while a mundane one costs me hit points, but I have no idea what that means diegetically.) I want the fiction itself to be detailed and vivid; I want the descriptions to matter.\n<blockquote><br/>But back to the main story, about the hack:<br/>How is the mechanic helping?<br/>It's not filling a purpose, it seems.<br/><br/><em>If</em> the resist/recover rolls are impactful, why even bother with things like axe vs mace, it's all leading to the same mechanic anyway?<br/>And if the mechanic is <em>not</em> impactful, why even have it? If it's all SIS based anyway? The ogre chop you, you're chopped. The ogre smashes you, you're smashed.<br/><br/>Or if it's a mix, how is the mix not weird? "The chopped arm works for now. Later, it falls off."<br/></blockquote>\nHow is the mechanic helping? It leads us to describe the fiction in detail, and that gives us more prompts for the parts we care about, for an interesting (at least to me, and clearly many of the readers of this thread) middle ground between mechanical objectivity and creative story-telling.<br/><br/>Why bother with axe vs. mace? Because it *matters*. A broken arm has completely different implications to a sliced arm or a pierced lung. Maybe I don't mind a broken bone because we have the ability to set that, but an open wound is terrifying, since there are airborne spore parasites in this part of the dungeon. All that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Why have it at all? To have just enough "gloracle" so we don't have a "crocodile story" situation: there is never any ambiguity about whether the GM can narrate an infected wound, someone knocked off-balance, a character being incapacitated by pain, etc.<br/><br/>"How is the mix not weird?" This part I don't understand. I would never say, "The chopped arm works for now. Later, it falls off," because that doesn't make any sense. We have to go with believable fictional outcomes first and foremost. The moves and options constrain our options for narration until the specifics are narrowed down to a fairly concrete area.<br/><br/>For instance, in the "crocodile story", I would narrate as hard and aggressive an attack as befit the situation. Perhaps that means the crocodile chomps down on your whole arm. Has the arm been bitten off? We don't know yet; I don't narrate Effect. Instead, we roll the move and we see: on a failure, I'm well within my rights to say it's been bitten off, and if that's what my instincts say, I go with that. If you roll a hit (especially the "you got lucky" option), it makes no sense to narrate that, so you get to keep your arm.<br/><br/>Like everything in *World games, it's not 100% objective and clear like a boardgame-style D&amp;D rule. Rather, it's creating a space for us to create a rich, developing fictional space while following our instincts. It's a fundamentally different kind of gaming. Instead of clear, black-and-white rules, we have moves and principles which present us with creative constraints (while preserving PC agency) which we then colour in with narration.<br/><br/>AW can never tell you whether someone's hand gets chopped off or not; it's just not like D&amp;D that way. What these rules do, instead, is help you build a vivid, detailed fiction, and then allow you to make calls within that framework in a way which produces fun gaming. It's not a boardgame - it's a roleplaying conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454545/#Comment_454545" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T09:13:08+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  9:13AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so what I'm wondering at this point is what it adds over the crocodile situation.

The system tells us that.<br/><br/>This, in turn, allows us (and incentivizes us!) to describe harm and injury in narrative detail. As the MC, I don't have to worry about "balance" or about what is "fair"; I simply narrate what the fiction looks like, in my mind's eye. This is tremendously freeing, compared to playing freeform!<br/><br/>It all brings us forward to focusing on the fictional events, instead of juggling numbers. Then the harm moves create agreement on the effects of those fictional details. For instance, I can say that you're bleeding, and your recovery roll tells us whether it will stop on its own or needs medical aid. I can say that the log smashes into your midsection, and the roll tells us whether you can "roll with the punches" or whether it takes the wind out of you. And so on.<br/><br/>I don't see the post-hoc problems you're describing, no how it is "blocking". When the GM describes your character getting hit, that <i>has happened</i>. There is no blocking or take-backs. Characters with hit points are just pretty resilient, that's all: they can be bruised or bleeding and just keep coming.<br/><br/>As I described earlier, it solves all those weird edge cases we get in regular hit point systems (like being invincible, or getting nickel and dimed to death by someone poking you in the shin with a needle).<br/><br/>I think the issue might be your vision of what D&amp;D hit points do/are. The way you play, no one gets hurt until the hit points run out. This is simply not the case in these rules: at best, you'll be knocked off your feet with your head spinning (with those rare 13+ rolls being the exception).<br/><br/>The way most people play D&amp;D, hit points mean that you get hit but you just keep on coming! That vision is a good fit for these rules; although getting hit almost always means *something* bad, it's not just "cosmetic" as with D&amp;D hit points.<br/><br/>The mathematical breakpoint may be an issue, true. We've already discussed a number of solutions (also, keep in mind that characters won't have enough hit points to simply spend +4 over and over), and it remains to be seen if it's an issue in play. It's possible that human psychology will deal with this just fine. I haven't put in enough hours with this hack to be sure - maybe someone else has! I'm still thinking about it, in any case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454559/#Comment_454559" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T19:02:07+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  7:02PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2016 7:34PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if it weren't for the mathematical issue I don't think I would've joined the thread, that's an area where I saw I really could contribute.<br/><br/><br/>But can you give me some clear examples of how it works when it sings, the hack?<br/>You can describe the attacks in detail in a way that's much freeer than freeform?

I could answer them but it's a significant challenge especially given dozens or hundreds or so similar situations come up every night.<br/><br/>(Yeah, we probably make a little over a hundred or so attack rolls per night.)<br/><br/>I haven't selected these to be rhetorical, I want to see the examples, I want to be sold on the hack or at least understand/appreciate the hack. The examples do seem difficult to answer.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D:<br/>1. Some monsters might have a special ability (similar to custom move in DW) that can cause instant arm tearing. Otherwise, the DM can't create this situation until the player has gone to zero. Then we'll see on the injury table what (if anything) was torn off, which is very possible but completely post-hoc.<br/><br/>2. The player dodges the club (by AC, or HP) or dies! It might take a couple of smashes<br/><br/>3. Use some magic similar to Power Word Kill<br/><br/>4. Use "space suit has its own HP pool" suggestion from before<br/><br/>5. This was the one time it was tricky. I guess don't put in destiny stuff in the game, lesson learned.<br/><br/>6. Saving throw!<br/><br/>7. A normal AC / HP situation. Since it's so rote and boring we can roll eight rolls at a time with eight d20, and it <i>stops</i> being rote as soon as someone goes down.<br/><br/><br/>In the hack:<br/>1. I have honestly no idea. I'm guessing that the player loses the arm even though there was a 10+ roll? Or that the hack is incapable of creating arm-tearing-off-situations without a custom move? Or that there is a post-hoc "ok, looks like the arm wasn't torn off after all"? Or that you have to be quick as heck and start doing the resist-harm-rolls in the milliseconds the crocodile is doing the tearing?<br/><br/>D&amp;D is unabashedly handwavy and post-hoc here. How is the hack not?<br/><br/>2. I have honestly no idea. I don't know -- and kinda don't <i>want</i> to know -- enough about head injuries to even start guessing.<br/><br/>3. ...? What happens!? See 2, head injuries. Rifle bullets. But also poison now.<br/><br/>4. This one seems pretty straighforward. You die in the mind eatingly vacuum of space even though your arm was only scratched from the scimitar. It's one hit one kill in the hack. (In many situations actually, not just in space, since "what happens, happens" every single flubbed defy danger or hack&amp;slash is potentially instantly lethal.)<br/><br/>5. Normal DW question not related to the hack. So I can skip it. Volley being hard to adjudicate well is nothing new.<br/><br/>6. Whoops turns out that the paralyzation ray wasn't so paralyzing after all. Even though you defied danger poorly, there was an extra layer of safety with the resist harm roll.<br/><br/>7. The PC gets chopped up, head fly off and needs to roll on resist harm to see if the head goes back on...?<br/><br/>I just don't <i>understand</i> the hack. That's how far this goes.<br/>Let's say you select both<br/>"This injury doesn't hamper you, you can ignore it for now" and<br/>"You got lucky: you'll find later that the injury's not as big a deal as it seemed"<br/>The head flew off but you can ignore it from now and find later that it's not a big deal as it seemed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454562/#Comment_454562" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T19:32:37+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  7:32PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2016 7:43PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I managed to come up with answers to some of them (4, 6 and 7) but at the game table I can't spend that much time all the time, and it was difficult to come up with answers. + The answers weren't any good!

However, it is a fun moment from a book everyone loves, and I wanted to show how it fits into this hack; some people really dig that kind of thing, and, if so, the hack allows them to do that in their game.<br/><br/>Now, on to your questions/examples.<br/><br/>Two important things here: <br/><br/>1. First of all, many of these are really *World (AW/DW) questions, nothing to do with the hack. For instance, how do we handle the destined archery thing? Has nothing to do with our harm rules. <br/><br/>What I would do is let the attack succeed (the dragon dies) but still play a hard move, and make it pretty hard-hitting - perhaps with in its last dying moments it destroys the whole village, or whatever thing seems appropriate. This way we feel the pain of the failure (making the die roll matter) even as we fulfill the character's destiny. <br/><br/>If someone was destined to kill a PC... now that would be a mess! I can't think of a good way of handling that one off the top of my head, and probably would never do it in-game (at least not a game which quantifies damage and death!). If I had to, I'd probably throw together some weird thing like the character dying but then coming back to life, fulfilling both criteria. I <i>like</i> this kind of creative conundrum in my games, but obviously these rules aren't going to be terribly helpful, so we're on our own.<br/><br/>It's really the "destined to X..." combined with an aleatoric resolution system which is the problem here, not any specific rules. You can't create an inviolable destiny and then expect dice to honour it!<br/><br/>2. You refer to IIEE in your other thread, so I'm going to assume you're fluent with that terminology. If this makes no sense, back up and ask me more questions.<br/><br/>In most of your problem cases, you're narrating Effect instead of stopping at Execution. Don't do that, and the problems vanish.<br/><br/>It's a mental discipline thing, just like how we don't describe the effects of a hit in D&amp;D until we roll the damage (or make the serious injury save). If you narrated someone's arm getting ripped off and then rolled a "1" on damage in D&amp;D, you'd have the exact same problem.<br/><br/>So, to use this hack, you narrate the execution of the attack, with enough clarity to show what kind of damage it *could* do, and then roll the move. The actual effects come *after* the roll.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D this looks like, "I swing my sword at the orc! And... *clatter clatter* I hit!" If you said, instead, "I swing my sword and I chop off the orc's head!", we'd have the same problem, where then we roll the damage and, if it's not enough, we have to go: "Uh, no. Actually you didn't. Not even close. He, uh, blocked it."<br/><br/>In this hack we do the same thing, except we also narrate the attack effectively *connecting* with the target. ("You feel the sword cut into the flesh of his neck!") We do NOT narrate the effect on the target... not yet.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the Schrodinger situation is "did he hit the target?", and we don't really know until we've done all the other steps, like rolling damage and counting hit points and making death saves - then we can narrate accordingly. In your interpretation of D&amp;D, we can't narrate a hit until we know that a certain amount of damage has been dealt AND it's more than the target has hit points remaining.<br/><br/>In this hack, the Schrodinger part comes in just a <i>touch</i> later - yes, he definitely hit the target: the question now is, *how badly does it affect the target*? Is it just a graze, or did it do serious damage? That's what's hanging on the dice.<br/><br/>The "resist harm" roll is just like the damage roll in D&amp;D in this sense, except we never weasel out and retcon, saying no one got hit in the first place.<br/><br/>That should answer 95% of your questions, but I'll go through the examples as well. (And this is actually great, because it's making us explore the ramifications of these rules, find corner cases, and I'm - hopefully - learning to explain them better. I'll also ask for your help with something, below...)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p7">7</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="You can describe the attacks in detail in a way that's much freeer than freeform?

in detail in a way that's much freeer than freeform? How?<br/>And what is the narrative/descriptive "input" to the damage rolls?<br/></blockquote>\nWhen I say it's "freer", I don't mean that there's more liberty in narration. Rather, what I mean is that you don't have to worry about the ramifications. You can safely narrate that crocodile bite, and the players aren't going to go, "Hey, no! Take that back!" It's a safety net that allows you to feel relaxed narrating freely.<br/><br/>The narrative/descriptive input is all the fictional detail of the situation. We can't know what "it hampers you" can even mean without describing the attack - well, where did you get hit? How bad was it? Etc. The whole thing operates on description and narration instead of numbers, just like other things in *World resolution.\n<blockquote><br/>1. Let's say the GM describes the crocodile chomping hard on with all its might on the arm, tearing it off. Now roll resist harm. What happens on a 10+ result?<br/></blockquote>\nThe main problem here is that the GM narrated the arm being torn off. That's wrong (just like it would be in D&amp;D). Instead, the GM narrates, say, the crocodile's jaw closing around the arm (and perhaps makes it clear that it's trying to tear it off, as crocodiles like to do).<br/><br/>On a 10+, the player got pretty lucky - which we can narrate as pulling the arm out of the crocodile's maw before too much damage is done, for instance. <br/><br/>That's pretty key here: we must envision an outcome where the character got pretty lucky - the very best - or nearly the very best - outcome which is plausible in this scenario.<br/><br/>The player must choose to suffer one effect. That could be shock from the pain (you "don't get to react" to this - I would personally describe this as the crocodile throwing the PC by the arm, and them landing somewhere painfully, but the arm is miraculously still attached and not too badly hurt), an injury which hampers him (in this case, it's pretty clear the arm isn't going to work too well!), or problems which surface after the fight (perhaps bleeding or torn ligaments). In all these cases, we just ask more questions about the fiction until we narrow it down to something everyone feels is "right", giving us a very detailed perception of the events, and keeping our heads "in the fiction".<br/><br/>For example, let's say I chose the best options for winning the fight: I get to react right away or maintain my position, and I'm not hampered by the injury. What this means is that there will be consequences to deal with later - I got lucky, but I didn't get *that* lucky.<br/><br/>This establishes some creative constraints on how we imagine this. Since the injury doesn't hamper me, clearly the arm is basically OK - we can't say it's been torn off or anything like that.<br/><br/>So, we play out the fight, and afterwards, when the adrenaline wears off, I say, "Hey, GM, so now I take a look at my injuries. How bad does it look?"<br/><br/>This is another perfect example of why all the earlier narration really matters. The GM has to come up with something which fits with everything that has been described so far: she might say that there are gouges where the crocodile's teeth cut into the flesh as I was thrown against the wall, deep enough to bleed freely. Now we have a situation to deal with: we have to take care of my injury, stop the bleeding, etc.<br/><br/>Same goes for your second question/example:<br/><br/>The rules don't give us clear answers; instead they create narrative constraints and then encourage us to talk to each other. They shape the conversation of play and get us all to imagine vividly what's going on and find ways to communicate with each other.<br/><br/>In this case, the rules don't say for sure what happened; what they do instead is require us to find a description which is consistent with a heavy blow to the head but doesn't have immediate consequences. (My first thought is a concussion!)<br/><br/>Like all RPGs, this is what we do: we build a plausible fiction together. One group might answer this very differently from another - if they have a more "cinematic" sensibility, they could describe things very differently. If we're imagining the game as a cartoon, we could even describe the mace or rock or hammer breaking on the character's head!\n<blockquote><br/>3. Let's say the assassin that cannot miss, uses a magical bullet, laced with strong poison for the weak, and a rifle that never ever misses, shoots the local orc president princess (a PC) right in the head. Now roll resist harm. What happens on a 10+ result?<br/></blockquote>\nSame here: we need to create a description which is consistent with our constraints. We know that the bullet has hit the PC in the head, and we know that she "got lucky" somehow (assuming the player chose that option). What does that mean?<br/><br/>I can imagine us describing the PC experiencing a glancing shot to the head, her thick skull or her tiara turning away the bullet (or at least turning it away from vital areas). Maybe an ear got torn off!<br/><br/>I <i>personally</i> know someone who took a bullet through the head (including through the brain, and coming out the other side!) and was back at work a few weeks later, without any obvious side effects. So nature is stranger than fiction in this case! <br/><br/>But you have to go with something that is plausible to your group - I can imagine someone who's never heard of such a thing would find it incredible. I firmly believe in the variability of injury, though: there was a case of a woman falling from 15,000 feet without a parachute and surviving the fall, and others have died falling just a few feet. Physical harm is unpredictable! This hack reflects that.\n<blockquote><br/>4. Let's say the space suit is all that protects you from the mindflayer-infested vacuum of aetherspace. If the air gets sucked out you're a goner. And someone chops a scimitar at your arm. Now roll resist harm. What happens on a 10+ result?<br/></blockquote>\nI would rule that the space suit is torn - surely it's not scimitar-proof! If it IS at least potentially scimitar-proof, then I'd make a soft move to that effect and play to see what happens. This is a *World question, not a "descriptive harm" hack question. Resist harm, in my mind, anyway, is just about damage to the character, not incidental stuff like clothing or the window behind them.<br/><br/>But perhaps we'd give the player another resist harm roll, to see how the vacuum of space affects them! Now it's getting trickier! Again, a detailed fiction and keeping things plausible is the way to go. "You got lucky" might give you a little longer to live - some air trapped in your suit, or whatever. If we can't see a way how that could save you long-term though, you're a goner. The GM makes some moves to that effect, and we follow the consequences/implications to their natural conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454566/#Comment_454566" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T23:26:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2016 11:26PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>6. Let's say some living brains are flying around, zapping people with paralyzation rays, and someone gets zapped, flubbing their defy danger roll. They roll a 10+ result on resist harm. What happens?<br/></blockquote>\nWell, again, they would choose one option to suffer. Either they're temporarily paralyzed but recover quickly, or vice-versa (they're fine now, but only for a few moments). If they choose a temporary setback (they can't react or maintain their position), clearly the paralysis ray affected them for a moment, but they're not actually paralyzed - it just messed them up for a second. It's just like making your saving throw - you can shrug it off.\n<blockquote><br/>7. Let's say four guards stuck in a web spell are chopping at a PC soldier with halberds, well within reach. The soldier rolls a 7-9 on hack &amp; slash. What happens?<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a Dungeon World (or whatever!) thing, nothing to do with the hack. If on a 7-9 people tend to get hit, I'd describe something plausible, like several halberds hitting the character. Then we describe in more detail and roll and select options, as for all the other examples. Getting hit with a couple of halberds is not a special case in any way, except that it allows the GM to narrate more potential problems. Again, it's all about the narrative detail. For instance, I could say that one halberd hit you in the arm and another in the leg. Your resist harm roll will now play with both of these things - if the "injury" hampers you, then both your arm and your leg have been pretty badly hurt.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454567/#Comment_454567" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T23:30:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2016 11:30PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, here's where your help could be useful:<br/><br/>Can you think of any simple solutions to the mathematical breakpoint issues involved in spending points from a pool on a roll?<br/><br/>So far, we've discussed adding *dice* to the pool (and keeping the best two), which means each subsequent hit point spent has much less impact. That should incentivize people to spend fewer points, shouldn't it?<br/><br/>I also mentioned the idea of having a chart of bonuses, each of which can only be used once. That takes the math out of it to a certain extent - you'll probably use the best ones at first, and then so on down the line. You can't spend +4/+4/+0, because we can design a chart which doesn't allow that option.<br/><br/>Can you think of any others?<br/><br/>This seems like a fairly important issue, since it applies to ANY game which involves spending points for a bonus on a roll (which is a LOT of games!). Clever solutions would be a very popular thing for designers to look at!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454571/#Comment_454571" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T05:39:02+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  5:39AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2016 6:13AM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, the help:<br/>I've already suggested lampshading it.

Actually well past execution and a little bit into effect.<br/>For example, the crocodile tearing the arm off. You ruled that the teeth definitely touched the skin but the arm wasn't torn off yet -- time stops and you have to immediately do the resist harm roll to find out.<br/><br/>Finding the exact right moment is difficult. You could say that the teeth have penetrated the skin before the time freeze. You could say that the arm has been a <i>little</i> torn before the time freeze. Since everything that happens before the RH roll happens, it's <i>very</i> important what moment you choose. I do not like having such responsibility as DM.<br/>Not only that, but <i>communicating</i> exactly which frame we froze at also seems very very difficult in my eyes, even though it's probably a learnable skill. We're looking at a lot of "Well, I thought X happened, didn't it?"<br/><br/>Freeze the time too soon and RH is effectively just a "second parachute" after defy danger / hack&amp;slash. Freeze the time too late and RH can't help you. And there is no clear stopping point, we're well into effect but not too far.<br/><br/>This difficulty I consider similar to the original crocodile story where there was too much power in my hands as DM and the players pushed back.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D the breakpoint is late in the execution rather than early in the effect. We don't have to wait to the blade starts to go into the neck, the teeth start to touch the skin. And since the effect is the much more crucial part, being able to put the breakpoint anywhere in the execution is great, much easier calls, much fewer disagreements.<br/>Also in D&amp;D, we don't have to freeze time, we know whether or not the effect took you out, which is the salient part, and then we can put the rest of the effect in the cat box and later see "Oh, looks like it tore your arm off my friend" <i>or</i> we can roll it out right now. It gives us tremendous flexibility in how to run it / describe it while giving us a rigidity and clarity of results + interesting fights with a lot of back and forth trying to tire each other out so we can land that final blow.<br/><br/>This rigidity comes at the significant cost of a too high proportion of "left facing arrows". (I know we're not allowed to use too technical lingo on S-G so in short): the mechanics influence the narration to a greater amount than vice versa, and ideally we'd want mechanics that rely on narration, incorporate narration, and solidify narration.<br/><br/>So I definitely see the reason for wanting a hack such as this. Unfortunately I don't think this one is<br/>- well-positioned in the IIEE cycle enough to be clear<br/>- significantly incorporating the narration [i.e. it has even fewer right-facing arrows than D&amp;D while having significantly fewer left-facing ones -- and more rolls] -- no matter what happens, it's the same old resist harm roll with the same old outcomes from it<br/>- tactically interesting<br/>- giving the GM any guidance on the amount and level of threats they can bring to bear<br/>- different enough from just a second and third layer of defy danger<br/>- precise enough in the types of harm and effects of that harm needed at the game table<br/>- giving the GM or group any clarity about how much of the effect happens regardless of the RH roll                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454574/#Comment_454574" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T06:13:01+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  6:13AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So put the cap at 2 instead of 4?<br/>(Ugh, as a nerd I know something is off when there's a 2\u2026 you want <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ZeroOneInfinityRule" rel="nofollow">ones or zeroes ideally.</a>)<br/><br/>As far as the mithril goes\u2026 it was another trick?<br/>Paul, my friend, I have a hard time following along on the rhetorical rollercoaster.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454575/#Comment_454575" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T07:00:16+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  7:00AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe that's it!

I'm sorry about that - certainly there was no offense intended here. I just wrote some rules that *I* think would be fun to play. I still think so. If you don't, it's no skin off my back!<br/><br/>I'm also not sure why you feel you are being tricked or misled - the mithril thing certainly wasn't a "rhetorical trap" or some such. It was just an example of something you *could* do with the rules. It's not to my taste, personally, but I could see people with different tastes enjoying it. No big deal.<br/><br/>I've been trying to communicate with in good faith and as clearly as I can (keeping in mind this isn't my day job or anything; I'm not working with an editor or giving this more than a few minutes' thought here and there).<br/><br/>I think that you are reading too much into the difficulties of "freezing time". It's no different from, well, basically everything we do when we roleplay, ever. <br/><br/>Just like D&amp;D attacks must be carefully narrated to be somewhere in the Initiation-Execution area (and retconned if you go too far, without anyone even noticing!), here we must make sure not to include too much Effect, or be willing to retcon it if we slip. Same with saving throws, or contest rolls or Diplomacy checks. No big deal; again, if we manage to do it in every other aspect of gaming, I'm optimistic it can't be *that* hard. (And particularly in *World games, we have to juggle that kind of thing *all the time*. I suppose - indeed, I *know* - some people do find that challenging and therefore don't play *World games. Well, this hack's not for them. No problem - they wouldn't be interested in it in the first place.)<br/><br/>As another example, it's exactly like the way "Taking the Blow" works in Dogs in the Vineyard, and that seems to work pretty well - you accept Execution but stop at Effect.<br/><br/>As for the "GM power" issues, it may help you to see it from my perspective. You see, I have absolutely no problem coming up with colourful narration and building on it. I don't need to make four attack rolls to be able to say that someone swings three times before finally connecting. That's the *fun* part of roleplaying, for me. Vivid imagination and all that.<br/><br/>What I find difficult and taxing is deciding on the effects of that narration. Ok, the ogre hit Jelly in the gut... that's gotta hurt. No problem so far. But now what happens? Can she get up and shake it off? Will it affect her ability to fight? Will it still hurt *after* the fight?<br/><br/>That stuff... I feel like it crosses a line for me. I don't want to be the one to say, "Yeah, sorry, actually you can't move at all, and you won't be able to for hours yet," purely on a whim. I'd like the system to help me here.<br/><br/>So, in this hack, that's precisely what happens: we have a variety of moves (from our favourite *World game) to create and adjudicate some action scenes, and then, when someone gets hurt, I just have to say what it looks like "on-screen" and then we roll the dice. The player then chooses if they want short-term problems or long-term problems, and the results give us plenty of feedback on how to describe what happens next. <br/><br/>It's exactly like the way all the other *World moves work - a clear fictional trigger, and then a list of options which we use as a skeleton to hang further descriptions from. This kind of thing, in my experience, creates really cool and really vivid fiction, and really fast. It supports the kind of play I like, and makes it easy.<br/><br/>Here's one area where I feel you're entirely wrong, incidentally:<br/><br/>"- significantly incorporating the narration [i.e. it has even fewer right-facing arrows than D&amp;D while having significantly fewer left-facing ones -- and more rolls] -- no matter what happens, it's the same old resist harm roll with the same old outcomes from it"<br/><br/>Since all the outcomes are based on preceding narration and descriptions, every single "resist harm" roll's outcomes are new and fresh and different. *Everything* in this hack proceeds from left to right and then back. The clouds are involved in every step of the way, because the options themselves are meaningless without the fiction. "It doesn't hamper you" means nothing without a narration of the nature of the injury, just like "you take definite hold of it" on a <i>seize by force</i> tells us nothing without the preceding narrations and the fictional positioning. Just like we have to position ourselves to make "take definite hold of it" an option for your character, here we have to create compelling fiction to make "your arm doesn't work anymore" plausible. <br/><br/>There's something VERY different about the way you and I are imagining it, clearly, because we apparently have completely opposite views of how it plays out. Unfortunately, that's something we'll never be able to resolve unless we actually play together and try some different variations. (I'd be up for a brief "mini-playtest", if you're interested, though scheduling might be disastrous! I've done a few over Skype with other mechanics and they've been pretty fruitful.)<br/><br/>I'm definitely open to discussing the details, as well as possible improvements. It would be pretty interesting to see how YOU would try to achieve my goals given your vision of how such rules operate in play. If you have better ideas, I'd love to see them. Again, this is basically a first draft on my part, not the final stage of an artistic manifesto after years of failed prototypes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'd love to see other peoples' brainstorms on this topic.<br/><br/>As for the math of point-spending, I'm somewhat on the fence. Ideally, you *could* occasionally spend so many points that you're guaranteed to survive, but the system would be set up so that those opportunities would be *very rare*. Most rolls, ideally, would fall into the +1 to +3 or +4 range, with occasional zeroes and much higher numbers. (I can see a +6 or +7 on occasion being a good thing.)<br/><br/>This suggests that some kind of increasing costs would be handy, which is why I'm somewhat tempted by the idea of diminishing returns, like the dice pool idea floated earlier. (Add one die per hit point spent, roll and keep the best two.) Do you still feel that's not a good idea? How would you analyze that, from a mathematical perspective? You know now what kind of behaviour I would like to see; is there a fairly simple model which would create that kind of behaviour?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454583/#Comment_454583" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T07:56:28+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  7:56AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, before I answer the rest\u2026<br/>I don't wish to be so hateful<br/>I want peace and respect<br/>I think part of the problem, and I introduced this, was that we were discussing two different systems (the hack and the vision), comparing and contrasting them, sure, but also sometimes arguing about both of them, a conflict on two fronts.<br/>And since I know this hack is an alpha thing I want to make it <i>better</i>.<br/><br/>Secondly, I <i>am</i> genuinely confused about where to draw the line in e.g. the arm tear case. The difference between stopping somewhere in the execution is that it's just sword clanging at that point (all of SCA just gasped in horror at me). Stopping somewhere in the effect, now\u2026 you've emphasized a couple of times that it's important that there's <i>some</i> effect before you go to RH. Just how much of that effect there is seems to me to be very impactful, very hard to choose and very un-assisted by the system.<br/>That is a huge crux for me.<br/><br/>Going to the stomach punch. Perfect example. For me, even saying it's hurting, goes over one line. And then the long-term consequences goes over another.<br/>Unfortunately, as far as I understand it wrt injuries, you kinda need to see the big impact in order to determine the original pain. That croco arm? Shredded, torn off or just grazed?<br/><br/><br/>To use a metaphor, and now I'm going to talk about BP as literally your body points rather than your luck/fatigue, which I'll call HP: you know the crocodile has hit. It's going to eat up at least one BP, then we'll make a roll to see if it's any more. But the GM has to decide how many BP the crocodile eats up. Just one, or ten, twenty? And there is always some effect, what happens happens, the stomach got punched, the head got shot. But what that effect is is in the hand of the GM.<br/><br/>However, I'm thinking that you could have some clearly delineated lines here. DD/HS failed: you get this-and-that well defined consequence [future harm badness], + a RH roll. That failed too, then you get this-and-than well defined consequence [real harm].<br/><br/>Defining these lines of consequences in a way that's both consistent and general looks like a significant challenge to me, though. In BP terms, it's like saying "the crocodile always eats 3 on hit, roll to see if there's more". But in narrative terms? That's difficult.<br/><br/>As far as the dice pool thing.<br/>Any mechanic where you put in a certain amount of currency A to affect randomness, and then get different effects in another currency B based on the randomness but you still lose your A, is going to have breakpoints. (A and B can be the same, or like in this case different where A is your numerical hp pool and B is your characters well-being in narrative terms.) Already we have a showstopper here.<br/><br/>If the randomness has few other parameters, which this has with it's fixed difficulty numbers and vaguely defined outcomes, those breakpoints are going to be much fewer and firmer.<br/><br/>The effect of A on the randomness being non-linear, such as dice pools and bell curves, are also contributing to this.<br/><br/>We could get on IRC to playtest and I could do the math (if I could somehow move my desk, it's not OK to work in the window on hot days like this).<br/><br/>Not necessarily today though, I gather it's quite late over there!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454584/#Comment_454584" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T08:00:44+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  8:00AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sure is!

I suppose that, for the "chanbara" style of fighting, you almost don't really need a damage system, do you? You can just call it "defeat" (and maybe include something about death or survival, for the PCs), and you're done.<br/><br/>My usual issue with "chanbara" fighting is that it should be all about positioning and jockeying for advantage. Very few games manage that - in fact, none that I've played. And I certainly wouldn't want the D&amp;D approach, where heavy armour and heavy weapons are the main factor in who wins. I'd love to see a game that does it well, though.<br/><br/>For my vision of D&amp;D, however, it's not like that at all. There's injuries and badass heroes who can push the pain away and do what needs to be done.<br/><br/><br/>1. I'd love to hear your suggestions on improving the design (or even an entirely different design!). It's pretty interesting stuff, which I wish games would explore more. (Also, I assume you've seen my other harm hacks, like the original one for Apocalypse World?)<br/><br/><br/>2. I can write out the procedure for using this hack in more concrete terms, if that helps.<br/><br/>Steps:<br/><br/>a) We determine (however we do) that a PC has been hit. (e.g. a failed roll)<br/><br/>b) The MC describes what the attack *looks like*, including where and how it strikes the PC. (Just like drawing a panel in a comic book, of the attacker delivering the blow.) But she does not describe any of the effects of the injury on the PC himself.<br/><br/>c) It's nice - but not necessary - if the MC describes some sensory details, like sounds or physical sensations, in order to paint a fairly complete picture.<br/><br/>Example: "As you're running towards the door, the paralysis ray sweeps across and hits your left leg just above the knee. There is a smell like burning ozone, and a nearly overwhelming tingling - like sparks running through your nerves - shoot up and down your leg."<br/><br/>d) If this is a game style where objectivity and clarity are important, the MC can say what exactly the attack threatens to do (e.g. "this crocodile is strong enough that it could tear your arm off!", or "it feels like the paralysis effect is spreading through your entire body; you could be completely immobile within moments").<br/><br/>e) The PC gives in to the moment (an incentive here would be nice, like marking experience, or recovering some hit points*), or rolls the resist harm move.<br/><br/>f) If the PC gives in or rolls a miss, the MC describes the full extent of the injury, as befits the earlier narration. The PC is paralyzed or has their arm torn off, in other words.<br/><br/>g) If the PC rolled a hit, the MC describes the injury, but obeys the constraints imposed by the move. If the PC maintains their position or momentum, the blow was light (or at least light enough that they could shrug it off for now); if the injury doesn't hamper them, there can't be any obvious damage to bones, muscles, tendons; if they "got lucky", there can't be any damage which would require serious care after the fact.<br/><br/>The MC is free to make it as scary and colourful as she wishes, so long as she obeys those constraints.<br/><br/>To use the paralysis ray example:<br/><br/>- On a miss: "You fall to the ground, your limbs jerking spasmodically."<br/><br/>- On a hit, there are many different possibilities, depending on the roll and the options chosen. Let'say player chooses that they got lucky and that they can maintain their momentum: "You grit your teeth and keep running, pushing your way through the door. When you get to the other side, though, your leg gives out -  you won't be running much further until it wears off." <br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/><br/>*: I'm actually kind of liking this idea. Maybe the PC rolls their hit die and adds that to their hit points. This would make resilient Fighter types more likely to put themselves in the way of danger and enable dramatic "He went down over there, but now he's rising from the rubble and he looks pissed!" moments.<br/><br/>Sidenote: It's also totally fine to include any other details you like, so long as you can imagine the character surviving them. For instance, I could say, "There is a gunshot, deafening in the small room, and you look down, in shock, to see blood spreading out on your white shirt." <br/><br/>I don't think you have to be all that careful in your descriptions, so long as whatever you narrate is something we all think it's plausible for the character to ignore for now. Tearing off an arm is clearly out, but cutting off the shirt and finding that it looked scary because of the blood but in fact is just a shallow graze which will easily heal by itself is very in-genre here.<br/><br/><br/>3. I'd love it if you could explain the math in more detail. I'm not sure how you're setting or generating any of these numbers (well, mostly the ones in the left column, I think I understand the right column). Are they arbitrary breakpoints you're choosing to test, or are they generated by some kind of formula? <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454589/#Comment_454589" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T18:13:01+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  6:13PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a dog in this fight (indeed, I've only kind of skimmed the thread), but a few observations:<br/><br/>a) when you make survival dependent on a dwindling pool of resources (even if its grooved spends like Gumshoe or the alpha version of this hack), it is important to remember that you are now centralizing the concept of being worn down, husbanding resources, trying to find the last ounce of ability (and also creative ways to avoid having to do just that.) This may seem obvious, but for example IMHO Gumshoe tends to <i>not</i> realize how central this experience has become. (And as a counter example, D&amp;D tends to <i>not</i> result in this experience as HP have no effect before they are gone and don't limit your ability to do stuff like Gumshoe pools do.)<br/><br/>b) if your goal is to allow the best spend, but also shake it up so that other spends become rational, then I think the easiest solution is to make the cost non-linear. Perhaps something like:<br/><br/>+1 for 1 HP<br/>+2 for 3 HP<br/>+3 for 5 HP<br/>+4 for 7 HP<br/><br/>...or other scales; maybe Sandra can figure 'em out. (I can't read matrix math, so I need to wait for translation.)<br/><br/>FWIW, Paul, I think the original AW hack you did avoided some of these issues by tiering how bad the potential damage was; maybe it's too gritty for DW, but I wonder if some of Sandra's feeling that results don't make sense might be alleviated by a division along those lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454590/#Comment_454590" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T18:36:26+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  6:36PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trix, it's not a fight but if it were, you've got to be in my corner, that's a basic part of bestie duties\u2665<br/><br/>Paul, question number 3: Generated (or rather, searched for): they are the weights for when the optimal point spend tips over.

It would be more direct to just spend a random number of points (as it works in D&amp;D).<br/><br/>I could see some kind of variation like this, though (I don't like it as much, but I bet some people would):<br/><br/>Keep the categories of the "resist harm" move, but remove the roll. Instead, on a hit the MC declares one of the following:<br/><br/>* The blow is minor - a bruising, broken skin, superficial damage. (1)<br/>* The blow is serious - wounding, broken bones, bleeding, etc. (2)<br/>* The blow is traumatic, deadly - serious bodily damage which isn't possible to heal by natural means. (3)<br/><br/>Now, the player may spend that number of hit points for each option from the "resist harm" list they wish to "buy".<br/><br/>I get hit with a serious blow, I can "buy" "<i>you got lucky</i>" for 2 points, or "you gut lucky" + "you can react immediately" for 4 points, for instance.<br/><br/>It's not to my tastes (I like more unpredictability in my injuries, and it makes it harder for the MC to make those calls, as well, because they have strong mechanical ramifications), but, again, some people might dig those features.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454597/#Comment_454597" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T19:50:19+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  7:50PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>You answered my "#3", in the long post above, but not the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>In particular, does writing out the procedure in that way clear things up or not?

That explanation leaves the space suit unexplained (which surprised me, I would've guessed it was one of the easier ones) but answers a lot of the rest. Thanks.<br/><br/>Question 1.<br/>This goes against my grain since I'm not really into movies like Die Hard and stuff like that where they got glass in the feet and stuff, I'm weirdly enough more squeamish about that than I am about a good old arm chop!<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>How often, approximately, do you want the wounds to<br/>1. Be a life-ending wound<br/>2. Be a fight-ending wound<br/>3. Be a real wound but they can still fight on<br/>4. Not be a real wound?<br/><br/>I would design a die roll with those four approximate thresholds.<br/>Let's say I want all four of them in equal measure (I don't think that's gonna be very good, but for ease of explanation let's start with that). So a 1d4 roll on that table.<br/><br/>Then I would put in that roll instead of the normal damage roll in DW.<br/><br/>For example.<br/><br/>Crocodile fightin time!<br/>But you roll a 6- vs old tick tock!<br/>Roll a d4. Oh, you rolled a 3. The arm can be torn off but you can still be in the fight.<br/><br/>Or if you had rolled a 2, the arm would be torn off but you would also be unconscious.<br/>Or if you had rolled a 1 it would just be a little ouch, a minor scar that you can cover up with a t-shirt<br/><br/>Or, Ambrose Bierce style knight fight in a dark house!<br/>But you roll a 6- vs old knifey!<br/>Roll a d4. On a 4, you got killed!<br/>on a 3, you fainted from the knife threats and the darkness<br/>on a 2, you got grazed, it's gonna leave a mark, but the fight goes on<br/>on a 1, your shirt got torn? or a surface scratch a little blood but something that'll heal in a day or so?<br/><br/>(You can see me still struggling with the "stomach punch" example. It's so contrary to my whole thinking and intuition that something can hurt but not really be an injury)<br/><br/><br/>Now, starting with this, there are two things left to do:<br/>1. Tweak the percentages, 25% equal chance of each is probably not what you want. Remember though that these only happen on a Deal Harm hard DM move.<br/>2. Put in some agency if you want it. Like some sorta limited resource to use up. I kinda... I kinda don't like that sorta econ in my games? Bad memories of stalled and grindy Fate games 'cause everyone's at zero FP come up... (Obv you'd want to set the percentages with whatever agency mechanic you put in there in mind.)<br/><br/>But regards to the percentages, let's say that since 2d6 is readily at hand, you want a 3- to be real death (around 8-9%), 6- to be a fight ending wound as you go unconscious / and or taken-out, crying, sick, 7-9 to be a real wound but they can still fight on, and 10+ to be the "oh it only hurt a bit but that's fine" result that I'm still having a hard time grokking.<br/>This replaces the 1d4 thing.<br/><br/><br/><b>Or</b>, and this is my preference, instead of a random roll each time, there's this thing that gets eaten up, this clock of destiny that your luck is running out until you can reset it with a good rest.<br/>HP!!!<br/>Just put in a couple of thresholds:<br/>At HP X you are dead, at HP Y you are taken-out but living, at HP Z you are hurt for real, otherwise you're just slightly hurt!<br/><br/>For example, HP over your half is luck and sweat, HP below your half is blood and meat.<br/><br/>In "my vision", it's <i>all</i> fun and games (sorry for the repeated catch phrase, it's getting tiring I bet), but in this tweaked version it's only <i>half</i> fun and games. You can't brush it off once you're down past the threshold.<small> Don't worry player's we're not changing anything in our home campaign!<br/><br/>(Essentially this is a model that has been used many times. 4e, WotC Star Wars, Fate (kinda)...)</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454601/#Comment_454601" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T20:18:06+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  8:18PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, the player may spend that number of hit points for each option from the "resist harm" list they wish to "buy".</blockquote>\nRight, this is very good, the ultimate lampshade. That's what I like in a point spend.<br/><br/>The other option is the other way around. The player can spend one HP for a +2, and that's it.

The suit gets punctured a) when it's fictionally appropriate, and when b) it's the MC's turn to make a move. If it's my game, the moment you're hit by anything which could plausibly damage your suit, it's torn. However, unless it's the main focus of the action (e.g. an enemy is deliberately trying to tear your suit, that's what we're rolling about, and you failed), I would make it a soft move: Air is leaking out, and soon the pressure inside the suit will drop enough that you're a goner! If you act immediately, you might be able to do something about it, but we're talking seconds at most. What are you going to do?<br/><br/>As for your suggestions, as you point out yourself, if we go that route, we're recreating every other game's "damage system". <br/><br/>We try to create a simulation where we track the damage potential of the weapons being used, effects of armour, the deadliness of the blow, and the sturdiness of the target, etc, etc, and find a way to randomize that, within the parameters we like to so. I've designed dozens of these, with different goals and different spreads (including some I really like, which I wrote up for <i>Fudge</i>), and I can always pick up GURPS or D&amp;D or whatever game and use their rules.<br/><br/>Here, I'm very intentionally trying to create something <i>different</i>: it's not a "simulationist" attempt to model reality at all. I'm trying to step back from the right-facing arrow stuff, the "physics modeling" stuff, and make it all hinge on the descriptions we're making in play. <br/><br/>You ask questions like "will the suit be torn", or "will the arm come off", and the answer is always the same: <br/><br/>We play the game with enough fictional detail to know. Will the suit be torn? Well, it depends on how thick the suit is, who the opponents are, what weapons are being used, how we described the attacks being made, how much room there is to maneuver, and so forth. It's all about the fiction - not the numbers.<br/><br/>To settle such questions, we don't look to the rules. We look at the fiction and we keep defining it until the answer is clear. Ask questions, nail down details, and eventually the reality emerges. It's a rich process, with subtleties that we enjoy and that make the game feel "real".<br/><br/>In other words (as an analogy), it's less like "make an ability check to clear the trap", and more like "roleplay, telling me exactly what you're doing, to see if you can disarm the trap". That's what's interesting to me here. I want the <i>qualitative</i> description of the harm to really matter, rather than throwing it in as an afterthought after the roll is made.<br/><br/>The 1d4 system is actually pretty good, I think, but it asks us to focus on objective measures of character capacity, just like 99% of other RPG systems. "You're taken out of the fight" is clear enough, and more than enough to know what happens next. What it *doesn't* create is a need to establish more descriptive detail - does it really matter *why* you're out of the fight? Well, not really, because if it did, we could potentially bypass it.<br/><br/>What do I mean by that? The rules have just told us that you're "out of the fight" - that's settled. If I ask, "How so?", I might learn that it's because I was knocked unconscious. Ah! "But!" I say, "I have this implant in my body which sends stimulants to my cerebellum when higher brain functions shut down. That means I should be back up in moments!"<br/><br/>Well no. If we allowed that, we'd be breaking the rules. So now we have to either avoid making that description in the first place, or change it until it makes sense to us. (e.g. "Ok, well, the fight is almost over. Can we just say that your implant got shorted out, as well?" "Fine.")<br/><br/>What I'm aiming for is rules which work the other way around: they give us the room to agree on descriptive detail, and then make everything reference that detail. If an injury hampers you here, and you can find a way around that, congrats - it doesn't matter anymore! The injury hasn't gone away, but, like the trap you sidestepped through clever roleplaying, it is no longer relevant right now. If you make the roll to recover, great, but we don't know how long it will take - that depends on the type of injury.<br/><br/>Instead of referencing the rules, we're referencing the fiction.<br/><br/>Yes, that means the rules themselves must necessarily be a little vague and a little fluid. But that's what gives us the room to go to the fiction first, to make things feel "alive" and "real". <br/><br/>That's the design goal here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454608/#Comment_454608" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T20:56:12+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  8:56PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Not a huge fan of that version, to be honest (we discussed this earlier in the thread).

We need more memorable terms than "left" and "right". Sorry! (Incidentally, I think that was an issue with your "Blorf Garp" terms for categories or roleplaying. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> No one will ever remember them, or at least not all the time. I certainly couldn't, while writing this - as you can see for yourself. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I think you missed the point of my example. The point I was trying to make is that fictional details can't override the mechanical output of our system. If I can "talk my way out of" being unconscious, I'm effectively cheating. For instance, in D&amp;D, I can't lose my last hit point but then say, "Hey, but the weapon he's using probably wouldn't kill me - so let's say I'm still alive, ok?"<br/><br/>The causality works the other way (at least for everyone I've seen play D&amp;D): if the rules establish I'm dead, *then* we figure out what that looks like fictionally. We don't say, "Ok, you take 4 damage, so you're dead..." "No, hang on, he's hitting me from below, so he probably hit my leg. I'll take the 4 hit points, of course, but I can't actually die from a punch to the leg. So I'm still alive, right?" No, we usually say something like, "Ok, fine. Let's say it got you in the stomach, then."<br/><br/>And that's what I'm trying to facilitate with my hack: not to have to do that.<br/><br/>In most games, if we feel that the blow to the leg shouldn't be lethal, we have to adjust for that with the numbers. ("Ummm, ok, -2 to damage." Or, perhaps, "Ok, but we'll treat it as non-lethal damage." Or whatever other thing we rule at that moment.)<br/><br/>With the way I'm trying to do it, the rules never put us in that position in the first place. We can just talk! All fiction, no numbers.<br/><br/>If I narrate hitting you in the lower leg with my whip, the rules will never "roll a 4" and tell us that you're dead. Instead, they tell me to narrate a nasty cut to the leg, oh, and, also, that this injury will hinder you going forward, but that it didn't knock you off-balance just now. (Things that *only* fully make sense given a description of the action. For instance, how will the injury hinder you? What activities will it hinder? There's no numbers telling us; it's all based on that description - we can imagine what a cut to the leg might hinder, and what it might not.)<br/><br/>That's why it's the description ("whip to the leg") which matters here, not the numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454618/#Comment_454618" name="Item_232" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T21:42:11+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  9:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>in D&amp;D, I can't lose my last hit point but then say, "Hey, but the weapon he's using probably wouldn't kill me - so let's say I'm still alive, ok?"</blockquote>\nYes, you can do that!<br/><br/>As for the categories in GDNS official, canonical theory\u2026 I thought I was clear than those names were only stop gap names, and they came about because you, Paul, seemed to mix them up with Ron's categories when they were called Narr, Gam, Dram and Sim.

But when I got the core of the thing (like 3-4 years later after AW was out), I understood that it relied on a <b>completely different frame of thinking</b> to be more efficient.<br/><br/>But now this hack uses an entirely different frame of thinking (and one not even too close to the common AW line of though) to be more consequent to the detail of the fiction, which is great, but it's another feeling, and so far not efficient enough. No wonder Sandra fought it so much. She is used to have a system that informs her about what is going on, to associate emotions to quantities, while you Paul (kinda like me) have problems doing that because your imagination is fighting with the system instead of letting it do it's work.<br/><br/>It's the same in Sandra's case, she's fighting your hack because her imagination doesn't find much to engage. Which is what your hack is about, not putting anything there to engage so your imagination can go free. No wonder this thread has gone so far in this discussion, productive as it has been, but also frustrating for all (because man, just by reading it I got frustrated too; you both have cool ideas, but you do need to walk more in each other shoes to get why they are so cool)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454648/#Comment_454648" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T16:50:28+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  4:50PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, this is pretty interesting!<br/><br/>For the record, I'm quite familiar with Sandra's playstyle (not personally, but the descriptions sound like a type of play I really enjoy), have done it a bunch, and really dig it. I'd like to think that I understand it very well. (Of course, like all things in gaming, though, you don't really know until you actually play together - but, on paper, it sounds exactly like something I really enjoy.)<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, you nailed the distinction in playstyle here, I think. It's very much about building on the fiction and letting your imagination go free, with mechanical touchposts on a few important issues to keep us on the same page. That's the *World model, in my opinion. I do understand that it's hard to grasp from a D&amp;D mindset. In D&amp;D, we roll some dice based on established procedures (e.g. "It's your turn, make your to-hit roll"), and that leads us to imagine some stuff. ("Ooh! Sounds like you got him good!") In *World games, the fictional stuff comes first, and we engage the mechanics only in retrospect (D&amp;D is often like this outside of combat, note). <br/><br/>I find it interesting that you think this hack is different from *World mechanics - in my mind, the HP/damage mechanics in DW were the part that didn't fit (AW as well, in fact!), and so I designed this to be more in line with the rest of the system.

Let me go through your points and tell you what they look like from my perspective. <br/><br/>First, though, I find your explanation of "SIS overriding the rules" (two posts back, on the "knocked out by a whip" topic) fairly unconvincing. Yeah, it <i>could</i> happen sometimes, but it's more of a breakdown of the rules (or means they were applied at the wrong time in the first place). I don't think "OK, you're down to 0 hit points... uh, but I guess you're not dead" (ignoring death saves and such for the moment, I'm thinking of B/X D&amp;D here) is something which happens very often in a functional D&amp;D game. <br/><br/>Like you, I'm having trouble thinking of an example. Does that mean we're in agreement there?<br/><br/>Generally, D&amp;D combat is very strictly rules-first (almost all right-facing arrows): we roll to hit, we reduce your hit points, and then, if we see they reached 0, we narrate some serious injury. Do it the other way around, and it gets in your way. If I narrated a glancing blow, does that mean we should ignore a high result on the damage roll? Um... better to start over! Roll first, THEN narrate.<br/><br/>I just watched the first two episodes of TitansGrave, and it's a perfect illustration of this kind of combat: by default, it's roll the dice and, optionally, fill in some description, but the description doesn't really matter. A good GM and group can make it more interesting, but that's kind of a special skill, not a fundamental principle of the rules' design. We can play out a whole fight without saying anything about the fiction at all, except who is attacking who and with what weapon.<br/><br/>I generally prefer not to go point-by-point (it makes it easier to get into arguments!), but here it would take too long to summarize. Please take this in a positive spirit, Sandra! I'm just excited to talk about games. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I don't see this is a contest or a fight - in fact, I'm only engaging in it because I respect your point of view and I'm really interested in seeing this through your eyes. (There's also the possible effect of improving the rules or coming up with something new!) Those are all good things!\n<blockquote>I'll copy my list of objections and annotate it<br/>I don't think this one is<br/>- well-positioned in the IIEE cycle enough to be clear<br/><br/>It's clearer now but the space suit example shows that it is well into Effect. <i>Something</i> happens before the roll.<br/></blockquote>\nYou're quite right that the rules don't help us to settle the spacesuit example. But is this a problem? I'm not sure any *other* RPGs help us settle this problem, either. <br/><br/>In your own example, for instance, you had to make up a new rule to cover the spacesuit situation (and it arguably conflicted with your definition of hit points - since, in your view, taking hit points away means you dodge or block or avoid something, but here it would mean you DID get hit after all).<br/><br/>Couldn't you make up a new rule for spacesuit-piercing just the same in any other game, as you did in your D&amp;D example?<br/><br/>Personally, I find this clarity liberating: I described someone getting hit, so, <i>yes</i>, they definitely got hit. Now we can talk about the spacesuit getting punctured or not, but at least we're starting from a place of "this weapon has physically made contact with this fabric - now, does that mean it's punctured?" instead of, "Some hit points have been lost - now, what does that mean? Should we interpret that as contact or not? What do hit points really represent, anyway?" The former is a much easier conversation for me to have.<br/><br/>Are there any other areas where this could cause trouble? That would be something important to look out for.<br/><br/>From where I'm sitting, I don't see an overlap with Effect. Execution should cover not only swinging the weapon but also connecting with the target (otherwise it would be just Initiation!). This seems much more clear to me than the other way around. Effect covers the consequences of the action. For instance, in Vincent's examples, someone gets picked up and thrown off a building. Blocking Execution means you're still on the roof (maybe wrestling with them). Blocking Effect means you grab on to a balcony on the way down (denying the intended *effect* of having them die by hitting the pavement below). Execution means that the attempt to pick them and throw them *clearly worked*, however.<br/><br/>Likewise, here Execution means the sword hit the guy's arm - now we're just haggling over the effect of the blow. If the spacesuit is flimsy, it wouldn't be very plausible for it to survive that unharmed! If it's sturdy, then probably not. But neither D&amp;D hit points nor the resist harm hack help us with that - we need to use our judgement or make a new ruling.<br/><br/>If it helps, you can think of the resist harm move as taking the place of the damage roll. They're exactly in the same place in the IIEE process, I'm pretty sure.\n<blockquote><br/>- significantly incorporating the narration [i.e. it has even fewer right-facing arrows than D&amp;D while having significantly fewer left-facing ones -- and more rolls] -- no matter what happens, it's the same old resist harm roll with the same old outcomes from it<br/><br/>The adjudication as a whole incorporates the narration but the RH itself doesn't take the narration into account by, for example, changing any numbers.<br/></blockquote>\nWell, the hit point numbers change. You'll spend more if the attack is more dangerous or comes at a more sensitive time, or less if you think recovery will be easy. However, I agree that's a fairly "light" kind of mechanical feedback.<br/><br/>So, I agree with you here. However! This is exactly how most *World moves work. There's no numbers changing and always 'the same old outcomes' with <i>Parley</i> or <i>Carouse</i> or any other move. Why should this be different?<br/><br/>If you don't like this sort of game design, that's understandable. Is there some way that this move takes the fiction into account less than <i>Parley</i> or <i>Carouse</i>, though? It seems very much the same to me. <br/><br/>The way the move reacts to the fiction is not by changing numbers but by influencing your interpretation of the fiction. For instance, if the recovery move says "you recover, but it takes you extra time", that's going to be *clearly* very different for someone who was slapped in the face compared to someone who has a broken leg. \n<blockquote><br/>- tactically interesting<br/><br/>This one hasn't changed either but I can understand why it's not a high priority. As an example, the reason D&amp;D has its cumbersome and convoluted death save procedure is so that someone can cast Healing Word on you and it's a tradeoff if they have to be quick enough.<br/></blockquote>\nThis one I don't understand. In D&amp;D, hit point loss has *no* tactical implications except for the loss itself (up until you hit zero, anyway). In this hack, hit point loss has no tactical implications except for the loss itself, as well.<br/><br/>However, when you get hit, you have to balance your current position or action against being hampered in the fight going forward and then again versus long-term trouble. That seems pretty tactically interesting to me!<br/><br/>For instance, let's say I'm trying to hold back a horde of little snarling goblin-creatures at a doorway. If I get hit and I don't choose to "maintain my position", some of them are going to get by. Is that worth taking a blow for? <br/><br/>It seems pretty tactically rich to me - that was kind of the point of the design.\n<blockquote><br/>No matter how many arm-tearing crocs you want to put in there, until there's some failed RH rolls, the arms stay on. Right? If so, then yes, the hack a pretty good idea just for that.<br/></blockquote>\nCorrect!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454650/#Comment_454650" name="Item_243" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T17:21:58+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  5:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2016 5:43PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>- different enough from just a second and third layer of defy danger<br/><br/>This one hasn't changed either, right? <br/></blockquote>\nThis sounds like an interesting objection. Could you explain what you mean by this?<br/><br/>Ultimately, all "defensive" or reactive moves in a *World system are variations on Defy Danger, just specialized for those exact circumstances. (e.g. look at <i>Last Breath</i>)<br/><br/>I could see adding more variety by making it a more active thing. For instance, when you get hit, you don't just roll to resist harm - instead, you roll to DO something (effectively AFTER you got hit). And the injury is somehow worked into that. Could be as simple as:<br/><br/>10+ - you can ignore the injury and do it.<br/>7-9 - You can do it, but you're injured, or you can go down but the injury isn't serious.<br/>miss - You go down from the injury.<br/><br/>I don't mind that, and I like the simplicity, but it doesn't allow us to take into account the nature of the danger as much. I think it would be harder to adjudicate.<br/><br/>Ideally we'd also have different moves for different things you do while injured... it could get pretty cumbersome. Worth exploring, perhaps, though! Perhaps something like:<br/><br/><i>When you soldier through the pain and keep barreling forward...</i> (this one would be about whether you can maintain your position or advantage)<br/><br/><i>When you take a life-threatening injury...</i> (this one would be about whether you stay in the fight now and whether it's going to need immediate care after the fight)<br/><br/><i>When it looks you're a goner, but you try to hold on to life...</i> (this one would have possible outcomes of instant death or lying on the floor, taking your last breaths)\n<blockquote><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">- precise enough in the types of harm and effects of that harm needed at the game table</span><br/><br/>This one I realize is a genre thing. You want a tiny scimitar to be as dangerous (numerically) as a giant dragon tooth and that's perfectly fine for your genre, so\u2026 we can scratch it.<br/></blockquote>\nCorrect! <br/><br/>Although I suppose you could make a giant table of harm results for various types of weapons and situations... and show how they interact with the options on the resist harm roll. For instance, "it hampers you" looks like THIS if you were hit by a sword, but like THAT if you got hit by a flying boulder.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that's worth the trouble, though. I rather enjoy the flexibility of dealing with just this one move.\n<blockquote><br/>- giving the GM or group any clarity about how much of the effect happens regardless of the RH roll<br/><br/>You've established that it gives <i>some</i> clarity so this one has been counterproven. But does it give <i>enough</i> clarity?<br/>Let's go to the stomach punch example<br/>Someone rolls 6- on not getting punched and 10+ on RH. What exactly happens?<br/></blockquote>\nOk, so you've been punched in the stomach? Again, first we need to know how hard and in what position and by who, and so on. Lying flat on the ground and having a rock golem smash downward with all its strength is going to look very different from taking a punch in a boxing match from a nerdy scientist who doesn't know what he's doing.<br/><br/>On a 10+, you choose two options, leaving one. So, effectively, the options are:<br/><br/>* You lose your position or momentum. (If you were trying to fly the blimp into the hangar, it swerves left as you buckle at the waist. Your enemy has the initiative now, not you - maybe their next action is to take control of the wheel!) <br/>* You keep control, but this will hamper you. (You grit your teeth and keep control of the blimp, and you can hit back immediately.) However, the MC can use this as justification to cause trouble for you - maybe you're nauseous or your head is spinning, maybe it's a -1 ongoing until the fight is over (if you're more mechanically-minded).<br/>* You can ignore it completely for now, but after the fight's over, you'll have a serious stomachache. (Maybe this means you don't get to recover hit points that night because it hurts and you can't eat properly.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454656/#Comment_454656" name="Item_244" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T17:51:55+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  5:51PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2016 5:52PM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's perhaps about how I understood AW and what concepts are core for me and what I totally forgot about. For me AW-like means: The GM establishes a threat, the player explains their reaction and rolls, the system tells us what happens (that is, we do what the most appropiate move says) and all players agency about the effects is to choose between the choices the system offers. The point is that there are ineludible consequences nevertheless.<br/><br/>But in this hack while yes, fiction comes first, HP reduction isn't a system nor a GM imposition. Your character may suffer more detailed and consequent effects, but as a player you get to choose if or when that happens. Detailed and inventive as it gets, it <i>feels</i> counterintuitive trying to grasp the concept. I get stabbed. Do I have the choice to bleed or not? You are telling me I've got a say on how much do I bleed? As wonderful as that sounds, it certainly breaks my immersion.<br/><br/>Compared to the usual HP concept, this last one is easier to grasp: <i>your character sheet bleeds</i>, mechanically speaking, and you ain't got a choice on that, which feels a bit more like reality IMHO. The system tells you when this happens and even tries (unsuccessfully) to add some detail to make look different each time. But then all we gotta do is adapt what the system gives us into whatever makes more sense to the game - which for tons of people doesn't break immersion, but stimulates their imagination instead.<br/><br/>So in the end, both systems can do really cool things in vastly different ways; you need to be prepared to adjust manually both of the systems shortcomings. They produce totally different tactical practices. On the hack it's more of a resource you can more freely spend, depending on the situation which is often consequent to the fiction; where in D&amp;D is more of a resource that is taken from you and you don't have a choice on how much nor how, which according to the system the later wouldn't probably relate very well to the fiction and needs player's help to fit.<br/><br/>Think in the right frame, help things a bit and both systems work like a charm, resist to it and both contraptions will utterly destroy your immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454657/#Comment_454657" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T18:06:43+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  6:06PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2016 6:12PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post. Although, with each harm hack I post, I always get this response: "You are telling me I've got a say on how much do I bleed? As wonderful as that sounds, it certainly breaks my immersion."<br/><br/>Yeah, that's true. Why DO I get a say in that? I understand how that might be jarring.<br/><br/>And, yet, that's how SO many AW moves work - why, in fact, most of them get you to choose something bad that happens to your character despite it being out of your control.<br/><br/>When I roll a 7-9 Fortunes in AW, I choose what bad stuff is happening in my hardhold. ("Um, I guess there are reprisals from the rival warlord!") When I roll Carouse in DW, I choose that I got "ensorcelled or tricked". And so on. None of these make any sense "immersively".<br/><br/>To me, that's part of the AW engine: it forces difficult choices on you. Your job as the player is to make those tough calls.<br/><br/>As you say: "the system tells us what happens (that is, we do what the most appropiate move says) and all players agency about the effects is to choose between the choices the system offers."<br/><br/>Isn't that exactly what's happening here? You roll, and then you've got to pick some of the choices offered - and it's probably not going to look good for you.<br/><br/>If it bothers you in THIS particular case, you could just say that the player spends the hit points, but the MC chooses the options. That would work, too!<br/><br/>We had a long discussion about this in the original "visceral harm" thread. Some people like it one way and some people like it the other way. (Although it's pretty arbitrary - e.g. Johnstone said he preferred the MC making the call, but then in his own hack the player decides how many points of damage are "shock" and how many are "injury", which is really the same choice again, isn't it?)<br/><br/>I don't like it, personally, because, as the MC I don't ever want to choose when a PC dies. Part of this is avoiding responsibility and leaving a tough call to the system. Part of it is for the flow of play: I'd rather hand off the conversation, for a more natural sequence.<br/><br/>PC does something and fails -&gt; I narrate something nasty happening to them.<br/>Now they roll and select options, which I use to make a move.<br/><br/>It's nicely back-and-forth. <br/><br/>The other way is basically all the MC talking after the initial roll, except for the player's choice to spend hit points. I suppose that's OK, but it's less fun and less interactive to me. I like the idea that the player can make tactical decisions, too, deciding whether they want to risk severe harm now or deal with the consequences later, that kind of thing. Sometimes it leads to fun situations, like the airship captain trying to keep control of the ship and having to decide just how much punishment they're willing to take in order to carry out their mission.<br/><br/>It also allows a player another avenue to express their character ("Yeah, Gorgon is badass knight who always goes for the kill, regardless of how much of a mess it leaves him later - he's rageful and reckless like that!), which I consider another bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454662/#Comment_454662" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T19:29:17+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  7:29PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Please take this in a positive spirit, Sandra!

I appreciate the kind words)<br/>So yes, I'll concede that the "you don't really die because the attack was so mild" does not often happen (it'd be because there was a mistake in adjucating the attack as having a HP threat in the first place) and that D&amp;D has a <em>lot</em> of \u2190\u2190\u2190\u2190\u2190\n<blockquote>You're quite right that the rules don't help us to settle the spacesuit example. But is this a problem? I'm not sure any *other* RPGs help us settle this problem, either.</blockquote> It becomes a problem that the weapon has made contact with the fabric<br/><br/>I've understood that Vincent holds that seeing IIEE as four very distinct things is not productive. Rather it's one big mess of "how to do things".<br/>But. The weapon physically contacting the fabric <em>as a forceful hit</em> that has happened now. It happened.<br/>Then there's no point in a RH because you're going to die anyway. B/c you can't survive some sharp blades forcefully slicing into your space suit fabric.<br/><br/>And from then on it's a slippery slope to "the blade coming at your arm with full force, that happened", "the punch coming at your stomach, that happened" (weird I'm much more squeamish about the stomach punch than the arm chopping). RH occupies a very... specific and to me very unintuitive slice of time.<br/><br/>Now, you <em>did</em> provide a list of guidelines. So that's fine. And I've played games with all sort of weird "exactly <em>now</em> is where you roll the dice" moments, like FFG WFRP where we quickly decided that it only "worked" for our group if we rolled the dice even before any initation or execution or effect at all, just intent.<br/>And I can manage. So I'm conceding that it's not unworkable. It's just very foreign to my thinking.\n<blockquote>In your own example, for instance, you had to make up a new rule to cover the spacesuit situation (and it arguably conflicted with your definition of hit points - since, in your view, taking hit points away means you dodge or block or avoid something, but here it would mean you DID get hit after all).</blockquote>\nYes, and the spacesuit would have it's own HP and when that HP was depleted, that's when there was initial-and-final contact, that was my thinking.\n<blockquote>Couldn't you make up a new rule for spacesuit-piercing just the same in any other game, as you did in your D&amp;D example?</blockquote>\nYes but the rule has got to take in account that contact has been made. Which would in my mind mean a very large chance of puncture and instant space radiation death.\n<blockquote>If it helps, you can think of the resist harm move as taking the place of the damage roll. They're exactly in the same place in the IIEE process, I'm pretty sure.</blockquote>\nI've tried using this metaphor but... it has some other baggage with it. The stomach DID get punched. The arm DID get chopped. We stop time right at the moment where the axe is bearing down on the arm with full force and all the momentum behind it and it's just piercing the skin a little little bit -- time freezes here, and then we roll see what happens.<br/>It's not a retcon but... it's... all the momentum of the swing might dissipate suddenly.\n<blockquote>If you don't like this sort of game design, that's understandable. Is there some way that this move takes the fiction into account less than <i>Parley</i> or <i>Carouse</i>, though? It seems very much the same to me.</blockquote>\nIn them you add your stat like Dex or Cha, right? Not that I'm the biggest fan of Parley <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>For instance, let's say I'm trying to hold back a horde of little snarling goblin-creatures at a doorway.

In D&amp;D gameplay adjustment is also easy to do. <br/><br/>You want action hero feeling? give tons of HP to the players (aka, higher levels) and make HP represent how much they can avoid being seriously hit, adding colorful descriptions without too much mechanical consequences.<br/>You want a more "realistic simulation"? stay between the first 5 levels and never roll, but use the table as the fiction requires, letting the GM and the players choose whatever makes sense given the amount of damage and how high the attack roll was. Describe hits and misses bassed on what conforms the largest part of the character's AC.<br/>And you can have "let's go for whatever comes out of these freaking awesome tables" feeling too, and just try to make sense out of whatever the system comes up with. That's always such a fun challenge for me that I've never ever wondered what HP actually was representing and plainly had fun with that.<br/><br/>I get to make my descriptions as gory or lighthearted as I want too, in the same vein of your hack, despite doing them after-rolling. Gee, I even make a big part of the description before rolling just like your hack, and then try to make ends meet, with whatever the system says after the rolls. So, while I get what the hack does, since I have always been able to face D&amp;D HP system with the right frame of mind, it makes my imagination fly instead of blocking it, and having intense, detailed, down-to-the-fiction descriptions has always been something I can choose to add or not, depending on the pacing or the importance of the situation; and not a requirement for the mechanic to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454667/#Comment_454667" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T19:58:03+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  7:58PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And you can have "let's go for whatever comes out of these freaking awesome tables" feeling too, and just try to make sense out of whatever the system comes up with.

A weakling 1st-level wizard who is just flailing uselessly will get "punctured" at the same rate as the 20th-level legendary warrior, using his best tricks. (Assuming AC and such is equal, of course.) <br/><br/>That's the kind of thing that always pops up its head for me in HP-based systems (maybe I'm too fond of fights with multiple objectives and tactical complications!). In this case, I don't understand your objection, I guess. Try again?\n<blockquote><br/>I've tried using this metaphor but... it has some other baggage with it. The stomach DID get punched.

How is that different from rolling damage and then rolling a "1"? Or even rolling a really high result but having it not matter because the target has lots of HP left?<br/><br/>Part of the issue here is that I'm comparing the hack with D&amp;D default rules (which are ambiguous about getting hit or not, but strongly <i>imply</i> getting hit with every piece of the puzzle, like armour helping you avoid getting damaged, more damaging weapons dealing more HP loss [as opposed to <i>the hardest to avoid</i> doing the most HP damage), the very nature of terms like "to-hit" and "bloodied" and "dealing damage", "healing" and so forth). <br/><br/>You, on the other hand, are thinking of your own interpretation, where no one gets hit until the hit points are lost. That, frankly, makes a lot more sense, and solves a lot of these difficulties! However, it's not how most people play. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote>If you don't like this sort of game design, that's understandable.

In those, you add Dex or Cha (to simulate ability), yes. In this one, you add for hit points and armour (to simulate resilience), instead.\n<blockquote><blockquote>For instance, let's say I'm trying to hold back a horde of little snarling goblin-creatures at a doorway. If I get hit and I don't choose to "maintain my position", some of them are going to get by. Is that worth taking a blow for? </blockquote>\nYou would always choose maintain my position, right?<br/></blockquote>\nWhy is that? I don't think *I* would. I would be, rather, weighing the necessities of the moment (keeping the doorway clear) against the potential damage - hence the interesting tactical decision. <br/><br/>That's why I keep saying that the description of the hits matters here just as much as the damage/HP numbers matter in D&amp;D. In D&amp;D, we could have a rule like, "When you take more than half of your HP in one blow, you're knocked prone." Or I might simply decide, "This is costing me too much HP. I'm gonna retreat, instead."<br/><br/>In this version, I'm going to judge based on the description of the blow, instead. Getting punched in the stomach? Ok, no problem. I can deal with getting beat up a bit, so long as no one gets through here. However, getting my head chopped off? Hell, no, it's not worth my life (or maybe I decide it is! that would be interesting, too): I'd rather give up my position and take a wound, screw my friends.<br/><br/>I hope that helps!<br/><br/>I like hearing about objections or things that feel non-intuitive because it gives me an idea of how well I'm communicating and also where things might be improved, design-wise. I don't think this is Best Rule in the World; it's just an experiment and I'd like to see how far I can take it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p4" rel="prev">4</a><a class="Highlight p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6" rel="next">6</a><a class=" p-7 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p7">7</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19273%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 6 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="A Descriptive Damage Hack for Dungeon World/World of Dungeons - Page 6" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons/p6" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="The space suit thing..

 I think we're talking past each other a little bit<br/>Maybe we can return to it later.\n<blockquote>Part of the issue here is that I'm comparing the hack with [...] getting hit with every piece of the puzzle, like armour helping you avoid getting damaged, more damaging weapons dealing more HP loss [as opposed to <i>the hardest to avoid</i> doing the most HP damage), the very nature of terms like "to-hit" and "bloodied" and "dealing damage", "healing" and so forth).<br/><br/>You, on the other hand, are thinking of your own interpretation, where no one gets hit until the hit points are lost. That, frankly, makes a lot more sense, and solves a lot of these difficulties!</blockquote>\nYes, this is it. I'm having a tremendous amount of difficulty seeing it as "every hit is a hit".<br/>I'm thinking of how many times in our D&amp;D game (see, I'm not even using AW/DW as reference, that's how lost I am) someone gets over the AC. If all of those were hits... even if they were just scratches... that would be, they would be like mince meat every single day of their adventuring career! They're going through many dozens of hits every day!<br/><br/>And for a hack like this to work... RH needs to be a <i>rare</i> thing, even getting hit, getting harm dealt (which would trigger RH) that has to be rare. That's probably where I'm tripping up. You're like "for example, someone gets their arm attacked or stomach attacked" and I'm like "OUCH!!! No!!!"\n<blockquote>However, it's not how most people play. </blockquote>\n"My vision" is actually neither something I came up with on my own nor especially rare.

It's a dramatic moment which happens when things go wrong. <br/><br/>I wouldn't use this in a dungeon crawl game where there are "dozens of hits every day"! Yikes! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I think just thinking of <i>that</i> gives me the same mental dissonance you're describing: what does that even mean, unless we're watching a boxing match? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If it helps to frame it in D&amp;D terms, the mental model I'm starting with here is 1st-level old school D&amp;D (where each character has, say, 1d6ish hit points).\n<blockquote>However, it's not how most people play. </blockquote>\n"My vision" is actually neither something I came up with on my own nor especially rare. It had already been brought up a couple of times in the thread and I've heard many other groups do the same. The text also supports it explicitly (but with plenty of weird corner cases that seem to be written with the opposite assumption, such as magic missile, how it even works I don't know).<br/><br/>Fascinating! I've played a lot of D&amp;D and I've never seen this, with any group (in three different countries).<br/><br/>I'd love to see how healing and healing potions and magic missiles and poisons and so forth are handled in these games. <br/><br/>I don't think I've ever even seen this in a podcast or Actual Play. For instance, the latest example I can think of the TitansGrave game. They use D&amp;D-style hit points, and it's quite explicit that each "hit" is a "hit" there. (Wil describes the hellions "digging their teeth into" someone's shoulder, for instance, even though the attack only deals 2 points of damage, or maybe even was cancelled out by the PC's armour. That's the standard I've seen across most D&amp;D and D&amp;Dish games. I think I like your version better, weird corner cases notwithstanding!)<br/><br/><i>I'd love to see a version of D&amp;D which embraces this explicitly. It should be possible to maneuver someone into an awkward position, thereby reducing their hit points, for instance. Maybe studying an opponent's fighting style could reduce their hit points, as well, since you'll be able to counter a lot of their tricks. Likewise, in some situations you should perhaps be able to strengthen your position - like taking the high ground - thereby regaining some temporary hit points. <br/><br/>As it reads to me, the system *says* that not all hits are hits in some of the descriptive text, but all the assumptions it makes about bonuses and penalties and such are written from a simulation standpoint. Bigger weapons "deal more damage", more resilient targets have more hit points, bandaging your wounds somehow lets you regain some "luck" of the "favour of the gods", and so on. It would be interesting if taking on disadvantages because your god favours them gave you more hit points, for example: "Ok, I peel off my armour and take off my helmet and I stand before the giant and challenge him to one-on-one combat."

It should be possible to maneuver someone into an awkward position, thereby reducing their hit points, for instance.

I mean, you know, so long as you don't assume that "getting hit" means you actually got hit, right? And you need special rules for armour and such - should your chain mail help you against a giant boulder? Perhaps.<br/><br/>The swarm, I'm not so sure about. I guess it depends how it works! I've seen different rules in D&amp;D for swarm-type things.<br/><br/>Overall, it would be a lot more elegant to mess with only one variable instead of three. Either your hit points go up or down, or your chances of getting hit, or your chances of landing a meaningful attack... instead, we have three abstract things which all imply different things but then turn around and say, "Except that's not *really* what's happening! Be careful not to interpret it that way!"<br/><br/>For instance, should having a weapon that's easier to target an enemy with give you a bonus to hit (since you're more likely to hit), or do more damage (which suggest the target has a harder time dodging it)? We can't really say. <br/><br/>Should dodging a bunch of shrapnel thrown at you be harder (i.e. take up more of your hit points) than dodging a single, heavier missile? <br/><br/>Ultimately, D&amp;D's combat system is one where we make a whole series of rolls without knowing what any of them mean in the fiction. Missing an attack roll could mean that you hit the target, but the armour saved them. Or it could mean you missed them altogether. Hitting an attack roll could mean you hit them... or not, since their hit point expenditure can mean they dodged it. Losing hit points sometimes means you got hit but you survived because you were tough, and sometimes means you parried. And so on. If a poison (in this version of D&amp;D) is handled as 3d6 HP loss, does that mean it got into your system but you shrugged it off, or does it mean you avoided the poisoned arrow in the first place, but it cost you extra "luck", because it was so deadly?<br/><br/>It wouldn't bother me so much, except that trying to actually nail any of these down so we can add lots of descriptive detail to our game means we pretty quickly run into a wall. So long as you're happy to keep it fairly abstract, it's great, though.<br/><br/>This is all old hat, I suppose. However:<br/><br/>The issue is precisely the one of stakes we were talking about in the other thread. I don't like systems where we roll stuff and we don't know what's at stake. It's a bunch of pointless rolls which add nothing to our imagination (and get in our way when we try!).<br/><br/>For instance, if I'm playing D&amp;D and I say that we're not going to take your armour into account on the to-hit roll of the falling boulder, that makes sense, right? Your armour shouldn't affect how hard or easy you are to hit - you're a target of the same size, after all. This implies that the to-hit roll's stakes are "you get hit by the boulder"/"the boulder misses". Ok, so once you're hit, shouldn't we take the armour into account now? It could protect you from damage, after all (especially if it's a *small* boulder, and you've got a shield in front of you or it's magical armour or whatever). But we just ignored it, because we just wanted to settle the hitting issue!<br/><br/>Ok, fine. Moving on. Now, let's see: you got hit by the boulder, right? OK, but you're a tiny pixie who has lots of hit points because of your extensive combat experience. So we can hypothesize that your hit points mean you're agile and nimble and you can get out of the way - the boulder does 2d6 damage and you have 50 hit points. Ok, so I guess it didn't hit after all (you'd be squished instantly!), but you dodged out of the way! Great! But then... why did we take the armour into account? That shouldn't help you dodge a boulder...<br/><br/>And so on. The lack of clear stakes at any point in the process just gets in your way if you try to nail down any of the specifics. <br/><br/>I had so many situations where it broke my ability to create choices for players, too. A character is trying to grab a statue from a pedestal, and he's trying to untie it. But a group of archers run in and surround him! They raise their bows and command him to stop. The player says, "Screw that! I have 75 hit points left. I ignore them and I keep untying the statue." We roll to hit, and a handful of arrows "hit", removing a small fraction of his hit points.<br/><br/>So, what happened, in the fiction? I have no idea. None whatsoever. <br/><br/>We can introduce other rules (like different types of Armor Class, "flatfooted" penalties, etc, etc), but they're all a patch on this fundamental problem of a lack of clarity of stakes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've ranted enough about D&amp;D hit points in this thread - I'll shut up now. My apologies! Thank you all for your input.

Is there any reason besides targeting that should rise the amount of damage to that weapon?. Then it does more damage. If you want to put a shotgun-like weapon in D&amp;D you can of course confuse easily: the projectiles spread so there's a higher chance of hitting something.

"Your attack scratches his armor but doesn't penetrate it!". You can switch to other stats as seems appropiate.

The former works just fine, so long as you avoid weird cases (like say you narrated someone getting hit, but then you realized the weapon was poisoned, except the mechanic for the poison shouldn't have been triggered).<br/><br/>I've basically said everything I have to say on the topic, so I'm not sure what ELSE I can add. We might have to agree to disagree! <br/><br/>There was a fellow called Mark Hughes who wrote an excellent analysis of D&amp;D combat, showing how none of the rolls actually determine anything meaningful, right up until someone gets to 0 HP, and then suddenly we have some clarity. It was an excellent analysis. Sadly, it seems to have disappeared from the 'Net.<br/><br/>Now, everything you said *seems* very logical. If a weapon is more precise, then it should have a bonus to hit, right? Except the only reason you're saying that is because of the terms we're using to describe the rolls - the roll is "to hit". <br/><br/>For instance, say I'm having trouble hurting my opponent. I roll and I roll and I'm not doing any damage. Mechanically, that means I need a better to-hit roll, right? Ok, I come in with some attack that can't miss - like your shotgun example, or perhaps some other kind of "scattershot" approach, like launching a whole bunch of darts blind or firing a mess of arrows at him, or whatever. Instead of throwing one dart, I use a spell to throw ten at once, in a wide spread, so that if he dodges to the side, the next one will hit! <br/><br/>Clearly that should add to my chances of hitting the target, right? I'm making an attack that is no more deadly than before, but the wide spread should make me more likely to hit the target. OK!<br/><br/>So, now we add a bonus to the "to-hit" roll. I roll and I hit! The target is hurt. Great!<br/><br/>Except then we notice that the reason I couldn't hit the target was because his AC was too high, because he's wearing head-to-toe plate mail. My "missed" to-hit rolls, therefore, really should have been imagined as light blows bouncing off his armour.<br/><br/>And yet here, by making a scattershot approach, I have *completely invalidated* his armour. Even though the numbers originally represented the impossibility of the darts making it through the plate mail - now, by making it hard for him to dodge (in the fiction) I have completely removed the advantage of his armour (in terms of the numbers).<br/><br/>How does that make any sense? <br/><br/>No, the only way we can play is to roll all the numbers first, and THEN come up with something that fits the results. (As you said, if it's a high Dex character, then maybe he dodges out of the way! If we hit and did damage against an armoured target, maybe we found a soft spot in the armour! And so on.)<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that's not a functional way to play. But dig into the numbers and everything falls apart - you have to roll everything first and THEN narrate. We can't apply any certain qualities to success or failure on any of these rolls - sometimes hitting is missing, and sometimes missing is hitting, and sometimes "damage" means the guy dodged a bullet, and other times "no damage" actually means you hit the armour really hard, and so on. They only make sense as abstractions.<br/><br/>We CAN fix this, by doing a few things:<br/><br/>1. Decide whether hit points mean physical resilience or dodging/luck. Sandra seems to play in a way where they are always "hit avoidance". That fixes a lot of problems! You and I prefer to assume that each "hit" is a blow landing. Likewise.<br/><br/>2. Decide whether the to-hit roll is about hitting the target or about penetrating armour (doing meaningful damage), and remove the other factor. Either don't believe in AC being about armour, or don't believe in it being about dodging and skill - and put that into the system in a different place.<br/><br/>In the original D&amp;D rules, all weapons dealt 1d6 damage. However your chances of killing someone depended on the weapon you used and the armour class of the target. So, I'd have a better chance of *dealing damage* to my armoured target if I was using a two-handed sword than if I attacked him with a dagger. Everything was modeled in terms of chances "to hit" (which, really, means "chance to wound or kill", nothing to do with hitting or missing). This is consistent and makes sense.<br/><br/>Later, D&amp;D added "variable damage", so different attacks rolled different dice. However, they made a mistake in keeping "armor class", leading to the current mess.<br/><br/>Here, you can see some D&amp;D nuts posting about the issue; they've given it quite a bit of thought:<br/><br/><a href="http://slitheringsecrets.blogspot.ca/2015/01/men-magic-list-hit-dice-for-all.html" rel="nofollow">slitheringsecrets.blogspot.ca/2015/01/men-magic-list-hit-dice-for-all.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://fightingfantasist.blogspot.ca/2010/01/od-weapon-damage.html" rel="nofollow">fightingfantasist.blogspot.ca/2010/01/od-weapon-damage.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://bxblackrazor.blogspot.ca/2010/10/explaining-d6-damage_21.html" rel="nofollow">bxblackrazor.blogspot.ca/2010/10/explaining-d6-damage_21.html</a><br/><br/>Once you realize how interchangeable to-hit, AC, and HP are, since they all work as different abstractions, you can start to see some interesting things.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>You'd like to represent the ability of some weapons to penetrate armour more easily than others, even if they don't necessarily make people more *dead*. (e.g. crossbows)<br/><br/>How can you do that? Easy, give them a +2 bonus to hit against armoured targets.

You have to roll a d20, add a value, compare it to a second value, then iff that comparison went a certain way you  find another value and subtract it from a fourth value.<br/><br/>Now that might look like a big old <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnionInTheVarnish" rel="nofollow">onion in the varnish</a>, those steps are in there because that's how it was in the boat-fighting rules that preceded even playing people in the dungeon. Damage to the boat's hull has been replaced by damage to "luck"/fatigue, boat's armor class has been replaced by "defense", both dextrous, and metallic, and magical.<br/><br/>But: It's fast and works well. There are a couple of steps, which we usually as one step (e.g. dropping the whole handful of dice at once, using differently colored dice), to see if you're killed or lingeringly injured. As a side benefit you see if the attempt was something you could skillfully defend against, or if it was tiring (in terms of fatigue or luck).<br/><br/>This is also mechanically interesting since it becomes a push-your-luck game, how far into the dungeon do you dare to go, until you have to rest up that energy/luck again?<br/><br/>Is 99% of the reason there b/c it's been there for years, in Dragon Quest and Nethack and Phantasy Star and a thousand other games? Yes. Even Zelda and Mario where there's a depletable resource when you mess up (hearts in the case of Zelda) -- it's just a model that's been very spread and known. And in games like Street Fighter too. It's a qwerty/dvorak thing (I type dvorak btw.)<br/><br/>Could we come up with a completely different model that's even better, even faster, even more tactically interesting and even more flavorful? Yes, I think so.<br/><br/>But: The "original" model has survived not <i>only</i> because tradition. It's because it's good enough and a lot of the dissonance goes away with "the vision". And it's got lots of hooks to put specific and flavorful triggers on and variety on, and the gameplay is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454706/#Comment_454706" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T05:58:23+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  5:58AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that took a long time to write out (I was on the phone) and I missed a lot of posts?<br/>Sorry.

So in non-crit cases, all I have to roll is the D20, then compare to AC, then (if applicable) subtract the damage. It's one roll; that makes it feel more like one thing, too.

I kinda have this aversion to not only dice pools but to "human randomness", taking advantage of psychologically hard-to-judge corner cases.<br/>If I'm asked to spend points of my own volition I'd like to know exactly what I'm getting into.

I like playing D&amp;D (if with the right mindset); I just think it only works <i>if you accept it as an abstraction</i>. The main "point" of hit points is to create a pacing mechanic for fights, which allows risk/reward choices for the players, as well as a bunch of other things. In D&amp;D, that's very important - the players have to decide whether to flee or push on, and the hit points determine, effectively, how much time they have to do so.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my own pet D&amp;D version has quantum hit points (you only roll your hit dice when you get wounded) and armour that subtracts from damage dealt. (I found a very neat coincidence, where subtracting one point from damage is exactly mathematically equivalent to improving your AC by 2 points, so I'm using that.) That allows me to essentially do the opposite of Sandra's approach and treat *all* hit point loss as actual, physical damage. <br/><br/>One thing I haven't been able to transfer to D&amp;D (which arose from this thread!) is the idea of lifetime ablative hit points. The idea is that some portion of your hit points disappear as your "luck runs dry" in adventuring, gone for good. This is pretty interesting to me, because it balances new adventurers ("beginner's luck!") against older, more experienced, and more skilled adventurers (who have better abilities, but won't "get lucky"). That reflects the change in mindset from a grizzled veteran to a hotshot, reckless new recruit very nicely. There are a bunch of very interesting implications to such a rule, which I hope to explore someday!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454713/#Comment_454713" name="Item_266" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T06:21:57+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  6:21AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the end it's partially about "how do you want the game to typically play out?"

I still uphold that both your hack and D&amp;D mechanics have their charms and problems, and that in both cases the GM and the players can help a bit to overcome those problems, if they are in the right frame of mind.<br/><br/>Going back to the shotgun example, if the player manages to make an attack that renders hp and AC math useless (no argue there) then it's time to engage with the saving roll mechanics! I wrote this before: that's what saves are for!. We could rule out that the scattershot attack covers a cone area and then everyone on the area has to roll their reflex save or take the damage. Is it full damage? my armour counts for something? That depends on the attack, rules will often explain if it applies or not, but you can also make rulings on the go according to whatever makes sense. Because nothing in D&amp;D says that you have to drop common sense in favor of the rules. But those are the kind of GM/player's gimmics that I'm talking about, the ones that help these mechanics work.<br/><br/>And as I wrote a few pages ago, not all mechanics are fit for everyone, as not everyone can fully get into a specific frame of mind so easily, specially if the magic that hold it together broke a long time ago, as it's your case with D&amp;D, and as is Sandra's case with other stuff.

Or you can create a newbie and have a huge allotment of luck to spend and space to grow... which takes me back to the Hero Points idea I've been mentioning for a while. <br/><br/>Imagine a game resource that you can spend to introduce slight limited changes into the scene. Like that pendant that protected you from the poisoned arrow and nobody knew you had until that happened. Or the fact that the sniper saw for a moment his long dead brother in the president's place as he was speaking and ended up purposely missing the shot. Call it luck, plot armor, karma, hero points, whatever. Give more of those to low level characters and reduce it for high level characters (you may rule it as "you get 25 - character level at the start of each arc" and you are set.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454731/#Comment_454731" name="Item_269" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T02:51:48+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  2:51AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, of course!

(It doesn't help that my preferred version of D&amp;D play is a challenge-based model, where things like narrative resources are not a good tool to introduce, as they clash quite thoroughly with the premise and/or agenda of the game.)<br/><br/>As for the shotgun example, it's similar: of course we can design a new rule or make a ruling.

However, I'm not entirely sure that the conclusion (always spend +4 or +0) follows.</blockquote>\nWhat a giant thread rewind? We even went over it and you accepted it and you proposed various alternative methods some of which were better?<br/><br/>Going over it again:<br/>The 2d6 can fall in 36 different ways. Right?<br/>If you spend 1, your average waste over the 36 ways will be 0.72 points.<br/>If you spend 2, your average waste over the 36 ways will be 1.11 points.<br/>If you spend 3, your average waste over the 36 ways will also be 1.11 points.<br/>If you spend 4, your average waste over the 36 ways will be 1.38 points.<br/>And you put in a spending cap of 4.<br/><br/>But, if you spend 0, your average waste over the 36 ways will always be 0 points.<br/>So, obviously, always spend 0.<br/><i>Unless</i> success is worth directely and concretely and factually more than wasted points. If success isn't worth losing some points, then always spend 0. [Even if success/failure has other costs -- you just agreed those costs aren't worth losing points over.] <i>But</i> if success <i>is</i> worth losing some points over, then the question becomes... how many points?<br/><br/>And that sounds like an unanswerable question, and, for some parameters and rules variants discussed upthread, it is very hard and fine-grained and difficult to estimate that.<br/>But, for the parameters "the spend adds directly to your 2d6 vs 7, 10 and 13, and you can't spend more than 4", it so mathematically happens that it becomes very easy and strict and clear what to do.<br/><br/>If the failure is as bad as just straight up losing 1 HP, that means we can add 1 point to each "failed" roll, right?  <i>That's why you're even trying to get a success.</i><br/>Doing this, we get optimal spend still is zero, with an average waste/loss of 0.41 HP over the 36 ways the dice can fall (some failures will cost 1 point in "loss equivalent", some successes will cost 0, and it averages out to 41% -- obviously, the same percentage as getting a 6- in AW. <i>No other point spend has a lower average waste than 0.41 in this circumstance.</i><br/><br/>What if failure is as bad then as losing <b>2 HP</b>?<br/>Then spending 0 gets an average waste over the 36 ways the dice can fall of 0.83 (strictly double the waste of the case of 1 HP; which is trivial to double check since there's the same amount of times the "pain weight" is wasted due to failure and the same amount of times that loss is avoided due to success). So, still no other point spend gives a lower waste.<br/><br/>Only when you get up to having failure be as bad as losing <b>3 HP</b> does it change.<br/>Then, all of a sudden (and this is partially due to the bell curve of 2d6), the optimal spend jumps up to 4, which has an average waste of 1.22 over the 36 outcomes. It becomes so important to avoid the loss-equivalent of 4. Trivially, spending 0 with a weight of four has an average waste of exactly 1.25 (three times the percentage change of rolling a 6- on 2d6).<br/>Less trivially, but I've ran the numbers: 3 is third best with a waste of 1.36, 1 is fourth best with a waste of 1.55, and 2 is worst with a waste of 1.61.<br/><br/><br/>Now, if there isn't a 4 spending cap, sometimes you want to spend 5, sometimes 6, often 7, sometimes 8, sometimes 9, sometimes 10, even in a very very extreme weighting do you want to spend 11 but never ever do you want to spend 3, 2 or 1.<br/><br/>You always want to spend 0 or at least four, making a 6- very unlikely.<br/>7 is a good spend since you'll get a 10+ on 35 out of 36 rolls.<br/><br/>Spending 0 is <i>strictly</i> better than spending 3, 2 or 1 -- there are some very specific and weird weights where spending 3, 2, or 1 are OK <b>but only</b> when you don't <i>have</i> 4 to spend <i>even if it's your last 4</i>.\n<blockquote>I mean, when you play D&amp;D and you're going through a series of encounters, should you, by the same logic, blow all your available spells and resources on each encounter?</blockquote>\nFor example, last Thursday, the party could defeat a trio of enemies that had killed a party the Tuesday before, by 1 spell cast by 1 PC that happened to completely nullify the trio's advantage. It was just the best spell for the situation.<br/>Spells have specific mechanics. But yes, "going nova" is sometimes the best.<br/><br/><br/>Remember, it's a mix of mathematical circumstances that make the 0 or 4 thing so extremely clear here.<br/>Chief among them, the bell curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454942/#Comment_454942" name="Item_282" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T19:24:16+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  7:24PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG I spent 40 minutes on this...<br/><br/>I was going to watch Yojimbo and eat berries                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454944/#Comment_454944" name="Item_283" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T19:50:32+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  7:50PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2016 8:16PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>The internet puts a weird sort of emotional pressure on all of us!

You never owe me a response. <br/><br/>That said, for *my* sake I'm really glad you typed that up. That's very interesting to me! I'll think on it some more.

However, this last message gives me enough to at least trying working through it myself. <br/><br/>It sounds like your analysis just balances failure against success, right? As far as "waste" goes? Is it unreasonable to assume that a player might also value a 10+ over a 7-9, and so forth? (Your earlier tables had different weights for those categories, so I assume you DID take that into account, but I have no idea how. Anyway, this is one of those things where you should feel free not to respond unless it's worthwhile and fun for you!)<br/><br/>At some level, my brain is rebelling against the idea that it's meaningful to compare fictional outcomes to a "cost in HP". It's probably just my human brain being an idiot (since, after all, that's exactly what I'm asking a player using my hack to do!).<br/><br/>Putting aside your *personal* preferences against, did the "dice pool" method fix this issue (as far as the math goes)?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/jangler">@jangler</a>,<br/><br/>That's an excellent article!

Is it simply the probability of failure times the "weight" of failure (as measured in how points we feel it's equivalent to) + the points spent on the roll? <br/><br/>And then we have to factor in the "cost" of a successful roll the same way (probability of success x points spent).<br/><br/>If that's anywhere close to right formula, I'm at least seeing how it creates some breakpoints for very inefficient 'spends', which is a good start. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454948/#Comment_454948" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:16:22+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, you might be thinking,<br/><br/>Assuming failure costs 3 HP or more:<br/><br/>Spending 3 has a 69% chance of being better than spending 4.

I input three weights, the weights for 6-, the weight for 7-9, the weight for 10-12 -- those three are inputted and then the weight for 13+ is always always always 0.<br/>For the image in my most recent post, it's using weights of 3, 0 and 0.<br/>Identifying a kinda bug in my model, I'll fix it tomorrow and re-do the tables and images. Maybe the breakpoints won't be 0 and 4 even, exciting!<br/><br/>(Note: it's the quaternary outcome model that introduced this bug, this doesn't affect the work on Gumshoe/Numenera.)<br/><br/>(If 7-9 and 10+ are both weighted 0, then why is 10 regarded as no waste? It should be 3 waste. I'll have to rethink this and post the new values tomorrow.)\n<blockquote>If you're willing to spend some time teaching me, maybe we can start with a simplified example (e.g. a straight 1d10 roll, 6+ is success)</blockquote>\n<br/>So there are ten outcomes on the die. A list of 1 to 10.<br/><br/>For each of those, imagine how much is wasted if that number comes up and put that list in there instead.<br/><br/>If you spend zero and weight is zero, then the list is of course all zeroes.<br/><br/>Average that list into one value. Zero.<br/><br/>If you spend zero and weight is 42, then the list is:<br/>42 42 42 42 42 0 0 0 0 0. Average: 21.<br/><br/>If you spend 3 and weight is 0, then the list is:<br/>3 3 0 1 2 3 3 3 3 3. Average: 2.4.<br/>Because if the die land on 1 or 2, you've wasted your three points.<br/>If the die landed on 3, perfect! You didn't waste any points.<br/>If the die landed on 4 or 5, you wasted 1 or 2 point respectively (overspend).<br/>If it landed on 6+, you overspent. You didn't need to spend anything. 3 points wasted.<br/><br/>Now, let's add those two together. Spending 3, weight 42. The list then becomes:<br/>45 45 42 43 44 3 3 3 3 3. Average: 23.4.<br/><br/>Now, we can at a particular weight count through the amount of points where the average waste is the lowest. Right?<br/>I just used a brute force search ticking up (after a while you see the average waste is only getting higher and you can stop searching).<br/><br/>In the case of weight 42, 1d10+spend, 6+, the optimal spend is 5.<br/>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 + 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 = 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5. Average 3.5<br/>Compared to just spending 4:<br/>42 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 + 4 0 1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 = 46 0 1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 8. Average 7.2 (that 10% chance of a 42 really, really we want to avoid because 42 is so heavy).<br/><br/>Now, if we can at a particular weight count find the optimal point, we then can do that for every single weight count in the history of the world until we reach the maximum points (in this case, 5).<br/><br/>And then you can filter all those weights out and only leave those where the optimal spend <i>changes</i>. Probably not 42. I just picked 42 because it's such a classic number and it would be easy to "see" among the numerical noise.<br/><br/><br/>I used a computer model for the other cases but I'm too tired to code it up for the 1d10 case (I've been doing the above 1d10 examples in my head). Tomorrow, maybe.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454956/#Comment_454956" name="Item_289" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:42:17+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now: nighty-night, little angels, nighty-night!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454957/#Comment_454957" name="Item_290" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:44:32+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS Don't worry about fixing the bug.

Because the border becomes meaningful because of the weight difference.<br/>The image has to be redone and all the work has to be redone, but that's a smop<br/>Good I caught this before I submitted to the journal!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454963/#Comment_454963" name="Item_294" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T21:58:53+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  9:58PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

He was a worker who suffered a ghastly injury: a metal rod three feet in length was driven by an explosion through his head, piercing him through the cheekbone, penetrating the base of his skull, and flying out of the top of his head, landed about a hundred feet away.<br/><br/>Incredibly, this man was able to stand, walk, and speak, using his hands and conversing normally. He recovered from the accident (the wound became infected) and lived for many years after the accident. He later experienced shocking changes in his personality and demeanour (even more interesting than the actual injury!), but, in the moment, it seemed as though very little damage had been done at all.<br/><br/>My father related to me a similarly incredible story during his time in the armed forces. They were training with grenades, and one of the soldiers slipped and dropped a live grenade between his legs. It exploded between his feet, with him standing on top of it. The man not only survived but was essentially <i>uninjured</i> (although his coat was shredded to bits!), except for some bruising from the shock wave. Unlike Phineas, there were no long-term effects.<br/><br/>The rather unbelievable luck involved in this incident was further underlined when, a few months later, an experienced officer suffered an accident during further grenade training. The troops were ordered to use up all ordinance used in any particular training exercise, and there was a single grenade remaining. Having trained with these grenades for many years, and knowing the "safe distance" at which they could be detonated, the officer felt quite confident in his throwing arm. He threw the grenade well beyond the established "safe distance", turned around, and started walking away from the site.<br/><br/>A single piece of shrapnel flew from the explosion and struck him in the back, penetrating his heart and killing him instantly.<br/><br/>My takeaway is that the effects of damage on the body - and the sources of possible damage - are far less predictable than we tend to think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455236/#Comment_455236" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-24T22:22:25+00:00" title="July 24, 2016 10:22PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just stumbled across this "review" of the damage hack on RPG Stack Exchange. It's very thorough, so I'll copy and paste it here. I agree with the remarks!\n<blockquote>So, after this question pointed me at that hack, I convinced the group I GM for to try out a campaign with Descriptive Damage. I'll describe our experiences so far, though they should be taken with three caveats: (1) all of us are still comparatively new to Dungeon World, so things might play out differently with a more experienced group (or at least a more experienced GM), (2) we've only played two sessions so far, and (3) the hack left many details up in the air, and different decisions on our part might have led to a very different game.<br/><br/><b>Preliminaries: Our Rule Selections and Interpretations</b><br/><br/>* We played with Resist Harm triggered by any injury to a PC. Damage to monsters was as in regular Dungeon World.<br/>* We played with standard HP totals and HP regeneration at a rate of half the character's class's bonus HP per level-up. Magical healing was as in vanilla DW. I did not use HP handouts to incentivize "doing fictionally and thematically relevant things".<br/>* We did not cap HP expenditures.<br/>* A character protected from an attack by armor took +1 to Resist Harm. A character impervious to an attack because of armor took +2 to Resist Harm. (We also considered abstracting away armor ["\u2026if you have lots of hit points, it's because you're badass and probably wear heavy armour"], but the first encounter was with a razor boar, and it helped to have the monster's fiction backed up by some mechanical consequences.)<br/>* Spell Defense was treated as giving +1 to Resist Harm.<br/>* We didn't use monster "deadly" ratings. Injuries were deadly or not as adjudicated from the fiction.<br/>* We couldn't figure out whether Last Breath was supposed to be in-play or not, so, as a death-adverse group, we kept it in. However, it hasn't come up yet.<br/><br/><b>Aspects that Played Well</b><br/><br/>-Specifics for Injuries<br/><br/>Playing without Descriptive Damage, our group often has good fictional detail on the how of an injury, but fewer specifics the what; with Descriptive Damage, we got both, even though none of the injuries I threatened were particularly exotic. For instance, our cleric, instead of just being beaten and bruised, has a nasty gash in the shoulder of her off arm that got infected when she fell into some filth, plus she's dealing with some lingering effects from a concussion. Our druid got stomped on by a gargoyle while in snake form, and now she has some broken ribs and a crushed lung. Our wizard broke two fingers when another gargoyle wrestled a book from his hands. Etc.<br/><br/>-Threat Differentiation<br/><br/>Since character's injuries were specific, the fiction picked up situations where certain monsters could exploit or exacerbate those injuries, making those threats play differently than indiscriminate ones. For instance, after slicing her shoulder, our cleric was still willing to get in a tangle with a roper since it was just trying to eat her. But she was a lot more skittish around a pack of gargoyles that could see and target the rent armor on her left side and her mostly useless left arm.<br/><br/>-Balance and Player Spending Strategies<br/><br/>In the hack comments, Paul writes:<br/><br/>"Realistically, if you want to be doing basically OK, you'll probably want to spend enough hit points for a +3 on each roll."<br/><br/>This was our experience. Most of the time players spent 3 HP (for a 1/12 chance of missing) but they were willing to put up more if they felt that avoiding the injury would let them wrap up a battle. So, roughly speaking, injuries under Descriptive Damage corresponded in magnitude to damage from a solitary monster with a damage die around 1d8, though, because of player agency, with much less variance. At least against solitary monsters, the game balance didn't feel like it shifted much.<br/></blockquote>\nCon't...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455237/#Comment_455237" name="Item_299" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-24T22:22:40+00:00" title="July 24, 2016 10:22PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2016 10:22PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Aspects that Played Poorly</b><br/><br/>-Confusion about "React Immediately"<br/><br/>One of the choices for Resist Damage is:<br/><br/>"You maintain your position or advantage, and can react immediately (if you do, take +1 forward)"<br/><br/>In the first session I read "react immediately" as a bonus to give a character: little or no in-story time would pass between their injury and their next action. This played a little oddly.<br/><br/>For instance, one of the times our cleric went for the razor boar with her mace, she missed, the boar inflicted an injury, and she rolled an 8 and chose immediate reaction, which she used to Hack and Slash the boar anyway while she was being gored. <br/><br/>Characterization-wise, that was cool, but it made the H&amp;S outcome more like a 7\u20139. And if she had rolled 9 or less on the second attack, I would have had to come up with another way for the boar to deal damage, which could have triggered an immediate reaction\u2026.<br/><br/>Reviewing for the second session, I came away with a different impression based on the paragraphs before the move. Instead, I read "react immediately" as a character's usual ability to keep taking actions through a scene and the absence of "react immediately" ala the Frodo example. That led to less dissonance between the fiction and the mechanics.<br/><br/>-HP Mechanics that Crossed the In-Fiction/Out-of-Fiction Line<br/><br/>We had a lot of difficulty agreeing on whether or not HP corresponds to anything in the fiction, mostly because either choice led to immersion problems.<br/><br/>HP as "Plot Immunity / Mistake Potential", Paul's likely intent, while supported by the hack itself, interacted jarringly with other DW rules, particularly ones about healing: HP outside the fiction but HP management in the fiction makes for disconnects between player and character motivation. Clerical healing, as mentioned in the hack comments, is the trickiest case, because it's unclear story-wise what the cleric is doing or why. We also didn't know quite what to do with potions, and our halfling druid had to invent a justification for singing her healing song in the middle of the night out in the woods when the party was trying to avoid attention.<br/><br/>On the flip side, attempts to equate HP with "Defensive Combat Skills / Stamina / Luck" presented problems with the hack rules not being designed for such equivalences. Skills aren't really something that threats of injury consume; stamina is something that should also be depleted by other actions and replenished by rest; luck normally applies to more than just injuries. One might be able to swing an explanation that uses a kind of divine favor or luck specifically for self preservation, but I feel like it makes more sense to rethink the DW HP rules to fit the hack than vice versa.<br/><br/>-Deaths by a Thousand Cuts<br/><br/>While differentiating monsters by threatening different injuries works well for the heavy hitters, monsters that wear PCs down slowly don't seem to work well under Descriptive Damage. Or, at least, I don't seem to be clever enough to describe injuries that players want to spend just 1 or 2 HP on. As a consequence, those monsters become a lot more dangerous.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that I always gave injuries with all three kinds of effects: immediate, temporary, and lasting. If I only threatened one, say, then hopefully players' spending would be motivated by their chances to reach the 7\u20139 category instead of the 10+ category.<br/><br/><b>Aspects that Played Differently</b><br/><br/>-Duration of Consequences<br/><br/>Under Descriptive Damage, injuries are about equally frequent as in vanilla DW, but their consequences are a lot longer lasting, especially because Recover from Trauma can have some steep time costs and still not provide a full recovery. In our game the party has just barely uncovered one front, and already every character has at least a few months to wait if they want to heal naturally; it takes some believing that they're not packing up and heading home. I may rule that a potion erases an entire injury, or else we'll end up with a much grittier feel than we normally like to play with.</blockquote>\nI think the idea about the potions (having a fictional effect rather than a mechanical effect) is right on. (And it resolves the earlier dilemma about the healing, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455678/#Comment_455678" name="Item_300" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T15:14:29+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  3:14PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to say THANK YOU PAUL for your original AW idea of a narrative based damage system!<br/>It's inspiring stuff I'm doing for a fantasy pbta game.

Also, their regeneration will work in a non standard way.<br/><br/>Both weapons and armors should NOT have any numbers attached to them.<br/>Their presence in the fiction, supported by TAGs and other stuff, will be used to inform which harm move is appropriate; then the outcome of whatever attack move was rolled will modify the harm as established to be either terrible or little.<br/><br/>With that in mind, here is what I have so far...\n<blockquote>All these moves are Player facing. The Player chooses which effect to apply and then describes it in the fiction.

So when players take damage, they determine their hit point total and then subtract the damage from that. <br/><br/>In practice, this means that players simply have no idea how tough their characters are (other than knowing their general hit dice) - and so working out combat strategies become less about HP management, more about tactics and working with incomplete information. The warrior could withstand many blows - and is more likely to than the wizard - but he could also go down with a single hit. It's D&amp;D, but scarier: emphasising a near religious need *not* to get hit by a dude and working out tactics to facilitate that. <br/><br/>There are some other considerations for Quantum HP - and I'm sure Paul will go into them - but that's it in a nutshell, I believe. There're are typically some limiting factors on the swinginess, but it's all about adjusting for taste.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455806/#Comment_455806" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-26T16:24:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2016  4:24PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that.

That's exactly right.<br/><br/>It works really well for my taste - it's still D&amp;D hit points, but without the occasional sense of certainty (i.e. "I have 7 hit points, and an arrow does 1d6 damage, so I can afford to take one 'for free'."). <br/><br/>I use a pretty tight bell curve (a "hit die pool"), so that your chances of being killed in one hit are pretty similar to regular D&amp;D rules (i.e., generally unlikely), but there's always a *chance*. It's a perfect balance, for me.<br/><br/>Hasimir,<br/><br/>You've adapted my harm rules for AW to a diceless version. That's interesting!<br/><br/>I suppose its success relies on your rewrite of, e.g., the Hack'n'Slash rules. How do you determine "little harm" vs. "terrible harm", and so forth?<br/><br/>My fear (and this is purely a taste thing) with the hack you've posted is that it's too deterministic. <br/><br/>As the player, when I take harm, I think about what kind of harm I am willing to suffer, and then calculate how many hit points I need to spend for that. Afterwards, I select the harm choices from a list. I have complete control over the entire process, it seems like.<br/><br/>Is that how you intend it to work?<br/><br/>Also, if you're doing this for Dungeon World, you might consider changing the names of the categories - they sound pretty AW to me, not very Dungeon-esque. Maybe "Pain" and "Blood"? Or "Blood" and "Death"? "Defeat" and "Slaughter"?<br/><br/>My original version of the rules simply used "Minor Effects" and "Major Effects".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455820/#Comment_455820" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T00:05:06+00:00" title="August 27, 2016 12:05AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, names definitely need to change to better fit the fantasy tone <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>I think I'll go for <b>Pain</b> and <b>Blood</b>.<br/><br/>Yes, it's diceless.<br/>I did not like much the idea of having to roll for my action, then for the consequences of my action, and then the MC was the one actually making choices.<br/>This way it flows faster and easier, at least for me, and introduces a Trollbabe-ish element in which the Player describes "his failure" <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Yes, I've modified the attack move stealing, mixing and recalibrating stuff from AW2... the whole thing uses three "<i>do violence</i>" moves of which Hack'n'Slash goes like this:\n<blockquote><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hack &amp; Slash</span></b><br/>When you use <b>immediate physical violence against an immediately dangerous opponent</b>, exchange harm, but first roll+STR. Notice how \u201cdangerous\u201d means being able of inflicting harm \u201cright now\u201d; if this is not the case then your violence counts as a <b><i>Sneak Attack</i></b> move.<br/>10+\t= choose 3<br/>7-9\t= choose 2<br/>6-\t= choose 1 + hard move (not Harm)<br/>- inflict terrible harm<br/>- suffer little harm<br/>- impress, dismay or frighten your enemy<br/>- take or keep clear hold of some thing/person/position against your enemy\u2019s efforts and advance<br/>- keep some thing/person/position safe and undamaged by the fighting<br/>- force your way into the enemy position<br/>- force the enemy to back away or be pushed somewhere<br/></blockquote>\nSo as usual <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span></b> rolling the move you look at the fiction and determine IF the move can be rolled, considering situation, descriptions, weapons, armors, etc... and if so, at the same time you set the general level of harm between beating/lethal/deadly.<br/>Then you roll.<br/>All attacks always deal "harm as established" by default; and then the Move roll gives you the option of increasing or decreasing it.<br/><br/>Let's say that the Fighter gets in a tavern brawl against a drunkard and punches start flying. No one is in armor, so we all agree it is "a beating or a nasty scratch" all around.<br/>The Fighter rolls the move and gets a 7-9 ... choosing to both cause Terrible harm and suffer Little harm.<br/>It means that the Fighter picks 1 Pain effect, while the Drunkard (so the MC) picks 1 Pain and 1 Blood effects.<br/>Say, both look <i>Thrashed</i>, and this would be a perfect opportunity to have the MC make the Fighter shine by picking the <i>Shocked</i> condition for the Drunkard making him go down, beaten and unconscious.<br/><br/>But now a friend of the Drunkard intervenes, with a knife in his hand!<br/>A knife is surely "something that could kill you" so if the same exchange happened again, with the same options chosen by the Fighter, he would now suffer Little Harm but from the Lethal list, which means 2 Pain.<br/>He is already Thrashed, so this can't be selected again.<br/>He has nothing in hand, so he can't be Jolted.<br/>And maybe the fictional situation doesn't allow for the Tangled condition to make sense.<br/>So he picks Dazed and Downed ... and describes how in the effort of avoiding being cut by the knife his opponent manages to land an open handed hit to his ear and, momentarily stunned by this, he gets forcefully kicked in the stomach, tumbling down to the tavern's floor.<br/><br/>If instead of normal clothing the Fighter had an armor, we would have evaluated it.<br/>A full suit of even light armor (boiled leather? heavy furs?) against the awkward swinging fists of a Drunkard should have been enough to prevent any real damage... so instead of the HnS move the Fighter would have rolled the Sneak Attack move.<br/>And against the equally clumsy knife it would have been a HnS with only the risk of "a nasty scratch".<br/>But then again, against a skilled assassin describing a precise stabbing attack against the soft areas unprotected by the armor, the knife would again have been "lethal".\n<blockquote>My fear (and this is purely a taste thing) with the hack you've posted is that it's too deterministic.</blockquote>\nMaybe it's a taste thing.<br/>I always liked the fixed damage used in AW, and fervently wished for a similar system in DW too ... the damage roll was always a problem and a bummer for me, robbing a Move of its real effectiveness, and not really sparking interesting descriptions.<br/>So yeah, definitely a matter of taste.<br/>My aim is to have the Players associate a sword slash to... well... a sword slash, and to pain and blood... not to a numerical amount that can more or less safely be managed.<br/><br/>Sure, the list of effects might be read as a virtual pool of 12HPs.<br/>But not really, because the 12 checkboxes are totally "unreliable" and "non linear".<br/><br/><b>Unreliable</b> because even in the example of the tavern brawl there were a bunch of Pain effects that did not quite fit the situation, so were not selectable... it was like saying that you have 12HPs, but already got 1 damage, and also you currently have -2HP because of fictional reasons.<br/><br/><b>Non linear</b>, because you can't always check all the Pain conditions and only afterwards move on to the Blood ones. It's relatively easy, like in the knife attack, to jump straight up to the "bad" options... and while each still counts as 1HP (virtually) its fictional consequences are damn heavy.<br/><br/>So you can't just think "<i>it does 1d6 damage and I have 12HPs plus 2AC, so at least for a couple of turns I'm safe</i>".<br/>And just like in AW2, combat got scarier as you <b>always</b> exchange damage, and can only reduce it, but never completely nullify it.<br/><br/>The only way to completely avoid damage is to not fight, or at least to focus on actions other than doing violence to your opponent. Or, actually, leverage fictional positioning to have an overwhelming advantage ... like when a skilled Fighter in full armor endures sloppy punches from a half drunk guy <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Which is one of my evil aims, to help Players and MCs play in a way that makes fiction be more important than numbers, like in the (in)famous 16HP dragon story.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>PS:<br/>for completeness sake, <b>Sneak Attack</b> is a variation of AW2 <i>Sucker Someone</i>, while <b>Threaten</b> is a variation of <i>Going Aggro</i> that is rolled on CHA! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Sneak Attack</b></span><br/>When you use <b>immediate physical violence on someone unsuspecting or helpless</b>, ask the MC if you could miss.

You're going for this realistic, detailed thing I put together with my "Visceral Harm" rules for AW, so how do Hit Points factor into it?<br/><br/>When I said "deterministic", it's not the lack of a roll (which I consider a feature), but the very reliable way in which the player can reduce the damage.<br/><br/>I can face any attacker and know that if I spend 7HP, I come out unscathed (just looking roughed up). There's not much to fear there, until the points are spent, anyway.<br/><br/>(Speaking of which, I guess the enemies can't ever choose to "deal terrible harm"? I'd say you should work that in there somehow. Perhaps on a miss result, they choose options against you. More on this later!)<br/><br/>I suppose if the hit points would be very rare and hard to replace, it would be OK. I would just get rid of them altogether, though! You've got this deadly and real-feeling thing going on, why have them at all?<br/><br/>I also find the Hack'n'Slash move very forgiving, but that's mostly on Vincent, not you or me. (For comparison, in DW on a 7-9 you hurt your opponent and your opponent makes a move against you, which could mean you get hurt as well. Here, on a 7-9 I can achieve an objective - like keeping an ally safe -, hurt my opponent, and "suffer little harm" as well. Or choose another effect, like frightening my enemy into running away. All that sounds like a victory to me, not a 'partial hit'. Similarly for a miss: if on a miss we still exchange harm and I get to choose an option as well, like keeping an ally safe, suffering little harm, or whatever, well, that's still pretty damn good.)<br/><br/>(Changing your miss result to allow the enemy to choose from the list, including things like inflicting terrible harm or achieving objectives, would make it much more dynamic in combat. Although your "hard move" option does accomplish this to a large degree.)<br/><br/>Given a deterministic version of this system, I think it could be really fun to play around with who chooses options and when/how, as well as the descriptions. I could see an interesting space for "MC describes the attack, player chooses options", for instance, as a less positive version of the player describing the damage and choosing the options.<br/><br/>Anyway, all matters of taste, in the end. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I suppose this should really go in the other thread, not here, since you're hacking my other harm hack now, not the one being discussed here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455831/#Comment_455831" name="Item_309" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T17:19:01+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  5:19PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This thread or the other for me is the same.<br/>My hack starts from your AW hack... but then again it is intended specifically for DW and heroic fantasy play, so I don't know where to put it &gt;__&lt;<br/>Can a MOD move the posts done so far?<br/>In the meantime, I follow here.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>HPs are present because this is a damage system for DW instead of an alternative for AW, I wanted to offer the Players a way to still be "heroic" in the classic action sense of the term.<br/>Thus the shield offered by HPs.<br/><br/>But you are correct, in my hack HPs are very few and relatively difficult to restore.<br/>I'm thinking of something in the range of CON (so something between -1 and +3) plus a small Class related bonus (something between +1 or +2 or +3 depending on how much combat oriented the Class is) plus a number of additional point as an Advancement option  (one Advance = +1HP, up to three times).<br/><br/>So a starting PC could have anywhere from 0 to 6 HPs total, while a high level hero might get as high as 9 or 10 maybe.<br/><br/>I haven't yet nailed down the procedure to restore HPs once spent, but it won't be as easy as drinking a potion. And anyway the use of HPs is never absolute... if you should suffer Harm you always suffer at least 1 Pain.<br/><br/>In my intentions this should make a Player feel bold and protected... once... then they'll basically be naked again. Or they can use HPs in small bursts, dulling the edge of suffered damage; but they will still suffer plenty of harm ... it's a tactic that can buy some time in a dire situation, but make very little to make you feel "safe".<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Eh eh eh, I guess we see move results in different ways then <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>First of all...<br/>To me 7-9 is a full success, but with complications attached.<br/><b>You do it, but.</b><br/><br/>6- to me is not really about failing the action, as instead is a permission for the MC to fuck you (or someone else) up <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>So depending on the situation and the fiction the action might even be a success, and bear positive fruit, even mechanically ... but the MC gets an evil token &gt;:D<br/>In my personal experience <i>success+shit</i> is often more fun and interesting than simple <i>failure</i> or <i>failure+shit</i>.<br/><br/>In this logic 10+ is then an even better success than a simple 7-9; it gives you more than you bargained for, or exactly what you wanted with no strings attached.<br/><br/>This is my general view, and all my moves try to represent it.<br/><br/>So looking at the HnS move you see that the PC suffers harm no matter what you roll. I don't see this as particularly forgiving. Especially considering the "heavy" effect that even 1 Pain can have on the fiction. And in a system without numbers, the fiction is all you have.<br/><br/>Second...<br/>What the original HnS does is to resolve a very tiny bit of conflict ... a single exchange of blows that, within a number dominated system, might reduce a bit (or a lot) your manageable resources.<br/>At least in my personal experience this often translates into (relatively) long fights with multiple exchanges between all parts involved.<br/><br/>That's not what I want the game to do.<br/>I want a move to decisively push the conflict toward a solution.<br/>So not as abstract as to say "10+ you win / 7-9 you win but", but also not as granular as the original HnS where you still end up killing stuff by friction.<br/>(<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">much</span></b> less than in D&amp;D, but if there is one element I don't feel nostalgic about is exactly this one :P )<br/><br/>Violence should not be about attrition, but about volatile high stakes. You can "game" it because you are a protagonist and things like HPs give you the chance to calculate (a little bit) the risks, so you can do more awesome stuff.<br/>But I don't want my games to be focused on long drawn exchanges of small attacks.<br/>You <b>do violence</b>?<br/>Then it will have a BIG impact... on your health, on your opponent's health, and on the things you both care about and that (presumably) brought you to do violence.<br/><br/>And yes... I don't restrict the MC to picking an effect from the list against the PCs because <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span></i> would be too forgiving <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Offering a generic Hard Move means that the MC can do those things, and many others too... maybe to other PCs, which in a lot of cases is more interesting and helps shift the spotlight around.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>But you're making me rethink the balancing. Maybe this is a more interesting option:<br/>10+ = 2<br/>7-9 = 1<br/>6- = 1 + hard move<br/><br/>When you have other aims than just "kill the target" having just 1 hold makes for an interesting hard choice: do you get that juicy Little Harm, or do you achieve a tactical goal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis" title="ebrandeis"><img alt="ebrandeis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebrandeis">ebrandeis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455834/#Comment_455834" name="Item_310" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T17:54:36+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  5:54PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hope this isn't interrupting the flow, but I wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone on this thread.

Like I said above, if they're rare and hard to replenish, then what you're doing is great. (More thoughts below.)<br/><br/>1. As for Hack'n'Slash, my feeling is that your design doesn't match the philosophy you're espousing in your description. You want combat not to be about "attrition" and death from a million wounds.<br/><br/>However, my feeling is that positive results on 7-9 and miss rolls could create precisely that.<br/><br/>Picture this:<br/><br/>There's a group of goblins rushing towards my friend, who is desperately trying to wriggle free from a set of handcuffs. What do I do?<br/><br/>I turn to face them, and meet them head on. My goal here is to buy my friend time to escape - I'm trying to protect him. A fight breaks out, and we're Hacking and Slashing.<br/><br/>Now I roll a miss. What happens?<br/><br/>In the case of a straight-up MC move, the goblins overwhelm me or slip by or whatever, and the fictional situation changes. I can't hold them off, or they capture me and start dragging me away instead, or they wound my friend fatally... lots of possibilities.<br/><br/>However, when I get to 'choose 1', I say, "I choose to keep [my friend] safe and undamaged by the fighting". I've achieved my objective. The cost is the harm I'm suffering (I can't choose to "suffer little harm"). This is much more like a war of "attrition" - I can always succeed in my objective (keeping my friend safe), no matter what I roll. It's just a question of how much damage I'm willing to take before I change my mind.<br/><br/>Same goes for any other single objective (hold this position, get that thing, etc): I know for a fact I can get it no matter what I roll, it's just a matter of how much it will hurt me. <br/><br/>(How much will it hurt? That's something which I can ALSO determine, first by asking the MC and then counting how many hit points I have.) <br/><br/>And I also can decide ahead of time *how* it will hurt me, since I'll be first deciding what level of damage I suffer (by spending HP) and then also deciding <i>what form</i> that damage takes. ("Ok, if I miss here, I could choose to drop my shield. I can do that and still last two more rounds before I'm out of hit points. Does that buy you enough time to get free, Jim?")<br/><br/>That's what I mean by "deterministic". The way you have this thing set up, there's a lot I know going into a chaotic fight, and not that much left to the imagination.<br/><br/>With a 7-9 result, it gets even worse, because there's no MC move there. (Your "miss" result is basically like the original 7-9 from DW's Hack'n'Slash.)<br/><br/>I think my harm rules (the various damage options, which you have kept almost unchanged) are the only part that will keep this dynamic: almost every one of them mandates some fictional change in the situation, so they will do a fair bit to transform the evolving situation. That part is good! But that's not what I'm giving feedback on, of course.<br/><br/>I hope that makes sense. I'm exaggerating a tiny bit (the MC move and other description will still create motion), but overall it's much less dynamic than other versions of these rulesets.<br/><br/>2. Choosing fewer options:<br/><br/>I think I like the less forgiving Hack'n'Slash (your second version) better, but I'm still not sold on the "choose 1 on a miss". (Although I like how you specify that the MC gets to make a move, as well - that's not clear to me in Vincent's formulation of the move.)<br/><br/>3. More thoughts on hit points in your version of the move. I like these as different options, alternatives to moving up or down the "ladder" for each point spent. <br/><br/>A. Each hit point spent allows you to ignore one "Blood" result.<br/><br/>B. Each hit point spent allows you to turn one "Blood" result into a "Pain" result.<br/><br/>C. By default, the MC chooses the results of the harm move. For each result, by spending 1 HP, you can choose for that result instead.<br/><br/>The last one, in particular, I think would be fun. And it would allow you to go back to regular DW levels of hit points and healing, which might be a bonus. (Since you'll be spending quite a few in a typical fight.)<br/><br/>Hmmm. I actually like that one enough I might try it sometime! You just need to clarify HOW the MC chooses (as an impartial referee, or as "hard" as possible - a principle must be identified, so the players know), and it's ready to playtest.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455837/#Comment_455837" name="Item_312" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T18:24:41+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  6:24PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, ebrandeis!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455853/#Comment_455853" name="Item_313" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T20:21:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  8:21PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't share your worries, but let's see, let's try to properly flesh out your example <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>First let's look at the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">attrition</span></b> effect.<br/><br/>So you charge the goblins head on and while literally hacking and slashing through them you try to divert their attention from your friend. And because you always get 1 hold even on a miss, you manage to prevent any harm to them.<br/><br/>But for how long?<br/>It depends on HOW you achieve it.<br/>Are you maneuvering to move the fight away from them and into a different location?<br/>Are you making such a fuss that all attention is drawn to you, but you are still right there?<br/>Are you standing in front of them, mowing down any goblin that gets too close?<br/>Is your friend visibly awake and maybe even standing, and wiggling to get free?<br/>Or is your friend feigning death/sleep to pass unnoticed?<br/>Etc.<br/><br/>This is important. It marks the difference between "<i>safe until my next Move</i>" which could very well be in a few seconds and "<i>safe for a few minutes/hours</i>" which is a much more relaxed timeframe.<br/><br/>Anyway, <b>you do it</b>. Even on a miss you buy time for your friend.<br/><br/>But you get a bunch of damage.<br/>Possibly a BIG bunch of damage depending on your armor, their weapons, and the fact that they are a group (for which I use Gang mechanics from AW).<br/>It could easily pile up to the equivalent of <i><b>Terrible Harm</b></i> in the <b><i>Could Kill You</i></b> bracket, so 1 Pain + 2 Blood.<br/>You sir are in deep shit no matter which options you select :P<br/><br/>Say, you want to stay as functional as possible, so you pick Thrashed, Injured and Wounded.<br/>You look like a bloody mess, left arm dangling limp at your side, and a bad gash in your belly that you have a really bad feeling about ... but you're still standing and kicking ass with whatever weapon you have in your right arm.<br/><br/>Spending HPs can alleviate this world of hurt, but you're still between a rock and a hard place. <br/><br/>AND it's not over, because on top of this the MC gets to make a Hard Move.<br/>Which means fucking you up even more.<br/>Or moving the spotlight to other PCs and making their lives more interesting.<br/><br/>In all this mess you managed to keep your friend safe.<br/>Which does NOT mean they managed to get free from the handcuffs, or to escape whatever place they are, or to avoid other encounters with goblins or whatnot.<br/>If they are PCs they have a moment of respite to attempt something useful.<br/>If they are NPCs they will do whatever the MC feels like.<br/><br/>I personally don't see this as the classic and unnervingly slow attrition of points <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/><br/>Now about the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">determinism</span></b>.<br/>I see your point.<br/>But to me it's not a problem <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My fair share of randomness and unexpected events comes in 2 moments:<br/>1) at the MOVE level, when you roll dice and don't know exactly what will happen<br/>2) at the level of "other Players and the MC get to say stuff", when you don't know exactly what they will come up with<br/><br/>The fact that I can plan <b>a little bit</b> ahead between spending available HPs and achieving the one single thing I truly care about... to me is actually a feature <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>As you can see from the example, yes you achieved the goal of buying your friend some time, but anything beyond that is a big question mark.<br/><br/>Plus, there is always the usual problem with this examples, which is we think too abstract and give the fiction for granted.<br/>You say with nonchalance "<i>I drop my shield</i>". Cool but what does it mean for the situation? It should have an impact.<br/>Given the example, if you ask me, it will be a BIG impact as with a shield to help you fend off lots of attacks you stood a chance and the fight was just "<i>something that could kill you</i>" ... but without it? You are dead meat!<br/>1 vs 3-5 = dead<br/>Which means your next HnS will have worse consequences, unless you come up with ideas to level the playfield, or to roll something other than HnS in order to prevent a harm exchange.<br/><br/>To me this is what prompts tactical positioning and creative thinking. What makes Players feel clever and heroic, and offers hard and interesting choices.<br/>And yes, a big chunk of this is thanks to your great idea for more visceral harm <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>I like how you specify that the MC gets to make a move, as well - that's not clear to me in Vincent's formulation of the move</blockquote>\nIt is not clear because in AW2 it is not there.<br/>My HnS is a summary of 4 different moves in AW2.<br/>In all of them, unless I misunderstand the text, the exchange of harm is already enough of a Hard Move, also because it is unavoidable.<br/><br/>It is a proactive approach.<br/>PCs are protagonist and if they manage to DO stuff the story and game are both more interesting and fun. But hell, they get to PAY for this.<br/>To me, it makes it easier and more interesting playing to see what happens next.<br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternative HP use.</span></b><br/><br/><i>A. Each hit point spent allows you to ignore one "Blood" condition</i><br/><br/>This makes a lot of sense, as I just noticed that by sliding down the ladder you achieves more or less the same result, but when you jump from one bracket to the other it doesn't work as expected and you end up spending HP to suffer MORE damage :P<br/>Good catch!<br/><br/>I'll rephrase it like this:<br/><i>Each hit point spent allows you to ignore one "Pain" or "Blood" condition, to a minimum of one condition, which must always be endured when harm is suffered.</i><br/> <br/>Your option B does not inspire me.<br/><br/>And your option C gives me problems.<br/><br/><b>Referee Option</b> - this might create social pressure. I instinctively dislike mechanics that require one person to act as an impartial referee... it is hard, and can easily be ill communicated. It can too easily be abused or misused by accident.<br/><br/><b>Hardest Option</b> - this is overpowered. The option to go "ops you are dead" is LITERALLY always on the table every time you score a Blood consequence.<br/>So basically what you get is a very flat dialogue where the MC says "...and you die!" and the Player yawns and says "...no I don't" while spending 1HP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455855/#Comment_455855" name="Item_314" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T20:27:47+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  8:27PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the previous harm ladder created problems both going down and going up.

You're quite correct to examine your "ladder" and make sure it's doing what you want, so I'm glad you got to looking at that, as well.<br/><br/>For Hack'n'Slash:<br/><br/>I still think it's a problem (that is, not to my taste) to have a move which has a 100% predictable outcome. (In the example above, the warrior could have chosen to "drive off his enemies", even on a miss. As another example, you can go into ANY fight with a specific objective - "I'm going to take that Rod of Power away from the giant" - and achieve it regardless of your roll.)<br/><br/>My harm rules, and the nature of AW's rules, keep the game dynamic beyond that (as you point out in your example), but I still think it's a bit limited. <br/><br/>As for your concerns about the MC's decisions, I understand where you're coming from. That's part of the reason I didn't use MC choices in the original hack you're working from.<br/><br/>However, it's not at all an insurmountable problem. It's just a question of setting the right expectations and then outlining what Principles are in play for the MC.<br/><br/>With something like my Option C, the idea would be that the MC goes as harsh as makes sense given the situation - not at all unlike making a Hard Move in any other situation. Basically, yes, this means that you're very likely dead anytime this happens. That's what we expect, and no one is surprised by it. I don't have a problem with that, since it's effectively  the same as the standard rules anyway: get hit when you're out of hit points, and you're dead. <br/><br/>However, it has the bonus of being slightly more "realistic" or "fiction-first". That's what I like about my "Option C": by default, the effect of an attack is the loss of hit points, which (mechanically) causes death (or "Death's Door", if that's in play). With "Option C", it's the attack which has a fictional consequence, and the hit points are just a mechanical tool the player has to try to mitigate that fictional consequence. (e.g. I turn the possibility of being cut in twain into merely be "knocked down" - precisely what hit points are supposed to represent, but normally only do in a purely abstract manner.)<br/><br/>That's what I was going for with this hack (this entire thread): to remove the direct link between "hit points" and "your character getting hurt", while preserving their function as "ass-savers".<br/><br/>Where this makes a difference is in those odd cases, like a character with 1 HP left who gets shot with an arrow through the ankle. With "standard" hit points, it's a tough situation: the fiction says the character is still alive, but the rules say he's dead. With a rule like this, there's more clarity: we know that the character's been shot through the ankle, and the hit point expenditure merely determines whether he's now bleeding to death or unable to walk (whichever effect we decide is appropriate, chosen by the relevant player), or not. <br/><br/>(As for "yawning players" - the bottom of your second-to-last post - I wouldn't do it that way. No point choosing options and <i>then</i> having them modified. Too much wasted time. Instead, determine the outcomes (e.g. 2 choices), then spend HP, then finally the relevant player chooses the options.)<br/><br/>(And the idea behind "Option B" was to remove the need for a "minimum one consequence must always remain" option. A bad hit still hurts real bad; it's just that the HP expenditure turns a serious consequence ("Blood") into a temporary one ("Pain"), like being knocked down instead of being chopped in half. I think that Option A, just ignoring consequences, might feel too "whiffy"; the idea behind Option B was to still make each hit "count".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463788/#Comment_463788" name="Item_316" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T18:56:23+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  6:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those who might be interested in using this hack, here's the modified version of Hack &amp; Slash which really makes it work.
