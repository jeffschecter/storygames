You've got to pay for it. Sometimes I think there's a man behind a counter who says, 'All right, you can have a telephone; but you'll have to give up privacy, the charm of distance. Madam, you may vote; but at a price; you lose the right to retreat behind a powderpuff or a petticoat. Mister, you may conquer the air; but the birds will lose their wonder, and the clouds will smell of gasoline!' Darwin moved us forward to a hilltop, where we could look back and see the way from which we came. But for this view, this insight, this knowledge, we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis."<br/><br/>I think everything in RPG design involves tradeoffs. If you improve clarity about what is and isn't important, you damage the illusion of an objectively pre-extant setting. If you improve fairness in adjudication, you may reduce improvisational affordance. If you improve the game's focus, you reduce the likelihood of random side issues organically becoming prominent (though actually this happens a lot in long-term BW play). If you make fictional positioning genuinely important, you increase the reliance on honest adjudication.<br/><br/>At some point, you have to just decide where your priorities are. Some players are genuinely okay with wasting time on dead ends. I'm not.<br/><br/>Matt</b><br/><br/>People seemed to like it, although I'm not really sure I'm saying anything beyond what was in the original GNS essays. Anywho, I've been asked to discuss each of those tradeoffs in turn.<br/><br/>1) Clarity versus the feeling of having a setting to explore.<br/><br/>This one is at the heart of Dave Berg's thread, I think. If you communicate honestly, on an out-of-game level, even with something subtle like Warrior_Monk's head-fakes, about what you have and haven't prepped, then the players will know that the entire world <i>isn't</i> a giant map just waiting to be uncovered.<br/><br/>This issue can even be applied to more relationship-focused games. "This is just a random innkeeper. He's told you all he knows about the strange goings-on about town. Move the fuck on."<br/><br/>In real life, of course, every wall covered with hieroglyphics does have a deeper meaning, and every person is a real, 3-dimensional being with their own life story, goals, etc. So for those who want the game world to feel real, cutting out the cruft can hurt that sense of verisimilitude.<br/><br/>2) Fairness versus improvisation.<br/><br/>One of the complaints OSR types have about 3rd and 4th Ed D&amp;D is that "there's a rule for everything." Every character has a thing or two they're good at, and so they just do those things over and over. Players aren't forced to apply any sort of creativity to overcoming the challenges presented by the game-world.<br/><br/>A related issue can arise in games where every action has a simple mechanical translation. Every Aspect in FATE is worth +2 when tagged, for example. To some players, this can feel artificial\u2014why should "Raging Inferno" and "Mildly Annoyed" grant the same bonus?<br/><br/>I think these criticisms are, potentially, oversimplifications: It's much easier to <i>justify</i> tagging "Raging Inferno," for example, and groups need to be strict about what qualifies as a tag. But there is certainly some merit to them as well. A skilled player of this style of game can simply defeat everything with numbers and may not need to really justify things fictionally, or may grumble when asked to\u2014which will annoy people accustomed to situations where they must think outside the box to overcome obstacles.<br/><br/>What is gained, of course, by having a mathematically more objective system is that you don't have to rely on the GM being as creatively in-synch with you, and you can be more certain that he or she is being fair.<br/><br/>3) Focus versus organically arising interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Again, fairly well-explored in the other thread, but briefly: Something that <i>can</i> happen in games where players are allowed to poke at every rock is that something that was intended as a minor or purely cosmetic setting element becomes prominent. The problem is that sometimes a rock is just a rock and we need to get on with recovering the amulet. It can be pretty easy to indicate when an avenue has been fully explored, *but* not if you're also invested in not receiving meta-information (see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, above).<br/><br/>An interesting game to look at here is Emily Care-Boss's <i>Sign In Stranger</i>. There's no illusion of an objectively pre-existing world, but since the game is about exploring the world (that is in reality being created on the fly), literally anything can become important.<br/><br/>I bring this up to point out that tradeoff issues that are normally considered to be closely aligned do not need to be.<br/><br/>4) Fictional positioning important = trusting in GM/group adjudication <br/><br/>Many contentious issues surrounding AW and DW and their relatives are, at heart, about fictional positioning. What constitutes enough leverage to make a Manipulate roll? When <i>can</i> you Hack n' Slash the dragon?<br/><br/>Resolving these things requires the group to be more aligned in their sense of aesthetics. Perhaps even harder to achieve, the GM needs to *really* understand their Principles and Agenda. Remember, the AW framework is a type of *free-form* play. If the GM is too stingy with letting players roll Moves (or do Moves like "inflict harm as established"), the game-world may feel impossible to navigate, but if the GM doesn't demand up-front fictional explanations for how the players are doing things like Going Aggro, the resolution system falls apart. Similarly, the GM shouldn't have rocks fall and everyone die each time someone rolls a 6-, but the failure moves have to hurt... enough.<br/><br/>Even in a game where such decisions are not left purely in the GM's hands, such as <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> (trait and item use is subject to group veto), the group members need to understand one another well enough to be fair but not too easy on each other.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Also note that for all of these trade-offs, and more besides, there do exist game designs that come at least pretty close to squaring the circle. Some OSR dungeons, for example, have pretty exciting and interesting stuff happening no matter where you go. BW's rules for Circles can help "promote" a minor NPC to an important one over time. There are subtle ways of scene-framing that do not break character immersion but do indicate when the players need to pay attention. "You walk for two hours on the East Road. As the sun begins to set, you come upon a burial mound and the site of a recent battle. What do you do?" This implies that there is at least the opportunity for interaction here, but there wasn't anything of interest for the past two hours.<br/><br/>But these mitigations do not undermine the simple fact that tradeoffs exist and you have to decide what you care about the most.<br/><br/>For me, my priorities are: fairness and rules fidelity in adjudication, keeping the game moving, continuity/coherence of plot and world. Depending on the game, I'd add "sense of discovering stuff that already existed outside our characters," but it would still be fourth on the list.<br/><br/>A common one for people to care about is, "Keeping player knowledge in synch with character knowledge." For some, this is *the* top priority!<br/><br/>What are some other tradeoffs you see as inherent to making decisions about design and play?<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427630/#Comment_427630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-24T11:58:37+00:00" title="January 24, 2014 11:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I very much agree with this, it's very close to what I was trying to say early in the previous thread.

Once you have all your ability scores and skills and beliefs and abilities and disadvantages laid out on the page many people tend to look to those numbers on the page to decide what to do next rather than engage with the situation in play.

And if you're someone who thinks about their gaming, this is necessary in order for you to have fun in Las Vegas.  Similarly in RPGs, gambling elements are often balanced with the security of the players - "just ignore the outcome if it would make a bad game!" is really saying "if the gambling element of this game is making your group grumpy due to bad luck (or too much good luck is making them bored), throw them a few free drinks or invite them to another table".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427636/#Comment_427636" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-24T20:05:09+00:00" title="January 24, 2014  8:05PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Excellent post! I'm mostly in line with your stated preferences, so I don't have much to add.<br/><br/>How about this one (although I'm not sure if it's quite right):<br/><br/><b><i>Spontaneous creative input vs. adherence to canon/stylistic unity</i></b><br/><br/>In a wide-open, creatively shared endeavour, there is room for all kinds of invention, for each player to inject their own style into the fiction and pull the game in the direction which interests them at the moment. The player's pleasure has a lot to do with the constant ability to add creative elements to the game. I suppose something like Universalis might be the ultimate example here.<br/><br/>However, shared creative input makes it difficult to adhere to outside canon, or to maintain stylistic unity. At the other end of the spectrum, you have things like massive published campaigns with long-running metaplots, or a group trying to play through a Lords of the Rings sequel while staying as close to canon as possible. In this game, when a question comes up (e.g. "What kind of animal do we encounter in the woods that morning?"), the priority is to consult sources and to find the most "correct" answer possible. In this kind of game, the focus is on celebrating a referent as accurately as possible: it's well worth the time spent to consult a book to find the right answer, and "expert" players have the right-to-decide when it comes to their area of specialty. (As another example, the group might consult the local physics expert when an unusual situation comes in play to see how a certain moment turns out.)<br/><br/>(For Forge-heads, this is a very contentious point that sometimes goes overlooked when discussing Right to Dream play.)<br/><br/>These two interests/sources of fun are quite clearly in conflict with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427637/#Comment_427637" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-24T22:15:41+00:00" title="January 24, 2014 10:15PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the summary, Matt!<br/><br/>I think the thing that excites me about innovative game design is always a matter of minimizing trade-offs.

Maybe a question relating to that?<br/><br/>(I think this is on-topic, because when you sit down to play most RPGs, particularly more trad ones, you are essentially engaging game design, and you have to make just the same kind of trade-offs as when you are writing a game text. But if others disagree I can take this elsewhere...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427672/#Comment_427672" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-26T17:09:22+00:00" title="January 26, 2014  5:09PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2014 5:10PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Martin, I think points # 1 and 3 in the opening post cover that.

I would argue that for the major, most-important axes, a solid game design has to make a definitive choice about where it stands. And this is what I see Dave Berg struggling with in regards to <i>Delve</i>: how much potential dead-ending is he willing to tolerate if such a possibility is in furtherance of his other design goals?<br/><br/>I suggest, respectfully, that something has to give, somewhere. Code words or ritual phrases can be taught to the players pre-game, for example, so as not to break their flow during play. Then if they hear the GM say, "You find nothing further of interest in this place/conversation," they know to move on. But during play the GM hasn't broken the fourth wall explicitly.<br/><br/>They do this in boffer LARPs of the Accelerant engine to deliver information from the GMs with the phrase "Let me clarify." In-fiction, it's just something a person might say, but out-of-game, all the players know that it means, "The following information is trustworthy, even if the NPC is generally a shifty d-bag."<br/><br/>But I fully acknowledge that any such solution is a <i>compromise</i> and involves moving the game back towards the center along one or more of the axes under discussion.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427687/#Comment_427687" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T08:07:50+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  8:07AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's an interesting question: what denotes "progress" in the RPG design sense? With the advent of the OSR school of thought, I think it's becoming clear that "progress" is definitely not a linear march forward but a sprawling tree (not unlike the evolutionary tangle, actually) that sometimes goes "backwards" or sideways. A lot of these tradeoffs, for instance, I see going to both axes; it seems more a question, like <b>Deliverator</b> points out, of "are you aware of this axis, and of the sacrifice you're making?"<br/><br/>I suppose you could put it as--I think that "progress" in this sense mostly consists of trying new combinations of these axes, and in understanding those implications.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427689/#Comment_427689" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T08:18:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  8:18AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd make the argument that the main elements of RPG design and publishing progress are:<br/><br/>1) An openness to different styles and techniques of game design. The hobby is stronger for having Story Games, Traditional Games, OSR Games, and Hybrid Games all available and thriving. Everything no longer has to look like a nail. <br/><br/>2) An awareness that mechanics can support more than just tactical play. The gradual awakening that different mechanics could effect aspects of the game beyond how the little men moved on the grid board. <br/><br/>3) A general rise in the quality of publications. From Indy games to Trad games to OSR the quality of the physical and electronic products being released (in terms of Layout, Print Quality, Component Design, Editing etc) is just far and away better than it was 10 or 20 years ago.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427699/#Comment_427699" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T13:36:33+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  1:36PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, exactly.
