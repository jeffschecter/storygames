Here's the core of it: you start with a scenario, pre-made characters, and a rudimentary setting. In the course of playing through the scenario, the players continuously flesh out each other's characters as well as the setting (and maybe even rules, who knows). <br/><br/>All of this comes from the starting point of character-interaction-based freeform play that Lisa and I do. We could basically play through this scenario and have fun without any rules. So anything that gets added comes from the standpoint of how it would improve simple freeform-based play.<br/><br/>So here's my starting point; the scenario is basically Steampunk LOST.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Situation</b></span><br/>The characters are all survivors of an airship crash en route between two hostile countries who were in the middle of negotiating an uneasy truce. They can't trust one another. One of them is most likely a saboteur who is responsible for the crash.<br/><br/>The characters are provided on prepared sheets. They have a couple of background events filled in, but there are more free slots for each character. These will be filled out during play (see below).<br/><br/>All of the characters met previously at the court in Jeortia, from which the airship took off. Some of them have run into each other more than once, others even worked together or had illicit dalliances. Most of this information, however, will be spontaneously made up by the players during the game rather than predetermined (some links are provided to kick off initial conflicts).<br/><br/>The airship, on its important diplomatic mission relating to the impending truce, took a route over the ocean to avoid possible attacks over the insecure borders between Jeortia and Kimam. The airship partially broke apart, and given the quality of this important vessel, sabotage is highly probable.<br/><br/>The captain managed to set her down on an island over the ocean. Now the survivors are not only facing a traitor in their midst and the tensions between the different groups, but also strange occurrences and weird creatures on their place of refuge.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Developing the Setting</b></span><br/>During play, the characters will, in the course of their conversations and conflicts, make statements about the countries, the war, certain factions, and the likes. These statements may or may not be true. Whenever a player makes an in-character statement (it can't be an out-of-character discussion), a player other than the one whose character made it can write it down on a setting sheet. This establishes the statement as common or special knowledge. It doesn't mean that it's 100% fact, but it is the way the characters in this world believe things to be.<br/><br/>For example, Sarah plays Ragha, and during a heated argument, she proclaims: "You Jeortians used to be a great monarchy, respected and civilized, until that bloody and unjust revolution turned your country upside down. And now the animals are running the menagerie!" Laura, another player, likes that idea and writes a piece of knowledge onto the Jeortia sheet: "Used to be a monarchy, but after bloody revolution is now ruled by the commoners." This is now, at the very least, what the history books say about the country of Jeortia, and most other characters will know and believe this information.<br/><br/>The game starts out with a few knowledge sheets that have some basic pieces of knowledge already written on them, but they're kept to an evocative minimum. Players might add new sheets for organizations, groups, countries, technology, or other categories that they create during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Changes to the sheets can only be done when a character makes an irreconcilable statement and the whole group unanimously decides to change the previously entered information.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Developing Character Backgrounds</b></span><br/>Developing character backgrounds works much the same way as developing the setting. Only in this case, one character will make a statement about a second character, and the player of the second character can then decide to add that statement as background information onto the character sheet. The second player may or may not actually be involved during the scene in which her character is being talked about.<br/><br/>For example, Laura's character is talking to Kelly's character about Ragha, who is not present; they are talking behind Ragha's back. Laura's character makes a statement confessing to Kelly's character, her husband, that she and Ragha had an affair at the court. Sarah now decides whether or not to put that information on her sheet. If she does, the affair took place. If not, it may or may not be a lie; that is left open. She can't add a refuting statement unless another character first utters it.<br/><br/>Eventually, someone will have "I am the saboteur" on their sheet.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>That's the portion about developing character backgrounds and settings--what do you think? I'm hoping that the developed setting will then be of use for people to play in with these characters or others, once the scenario ends, but I would hope that this happens organically and without specific instructions on how to do that. Basically it's all a DIY starter kit. Instead of front-loading the game, I want as much Development In Play as possible.<br/><br/>There'll be a basic conflict res system, and I have to figure out whether I just want the characters to interact, or whether there should be some kind of rotating responsibility for the other threats on the island. <br/><br/>I'm also wondering at this juncture whether to include an endpoint for the scenario, whether to provide a rotating responsibility for other things on the island, how to handle having many (8-10) characters with few players, etc. Do the characters need specific things to fight about? Would it be worthwhile adding some kind of goal ladder that'll lead to their rescue? Can I just count on the established beginning tension to lead to conflicts? And what do conflicts mean, other than just one character momentarily gaining an upper hand over another? How do I keep tension up as the characters develop, through mechanics or the setup, if I don't have a hand in how they develop for any one playing group?<br/><br/>Also: I guess this could just be a scenario, with the setting/character background rules as additions, to an existing game. Any existing game, maybe? Does it need its own rules or would it work equally or better as an open scenario a la Well of Souls? (Character stats would then have to be made up by the group before play, which rubs me a bit the wrong way--I want instant playability.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105359/#Comment_105359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:46:26+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christian, have you thought about Jeepform or some flavor of nordic freeform?  You're describing a tightly constrained, relationship-focused situation with established characters - that's what came to mind right away.  <br/><br/>I really like the character background development method you describe - it reminds me of the bluebooking component in <i>Sign In Stranger, </i>where what you say about others has mechanical impact when they invoke it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105365/#Comment_105365" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T10:09:45+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 10:09AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I knew very little about jeepform until this weekend (when I read a couple of games and talked to Emily).
