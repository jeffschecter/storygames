First off, it\u2019s has two conditions to satisfy. Secondly, most people remember that there is something up with the Fae and promises. But they don\u2019t remember that they get experience for making promises to the Fae. You need to be direct about reminding them. When you ask, \u201cDo you promise?\u201d which you should be doing constantly, offer them a card that says \u201cMark Experience\u201d in easy to read block letters. This should allow the dialogue to continue after the briefest of pauses, but keeps the benefits fresh in their minds. Then, after you have racked up some of these (you should keep a list that others could reference if they wanted), start pushing them to break those promises. <br/><br/>If no one breaks their promises outright, just get picky about what counts. You're a Fae. Use faerie logic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418332/#Comment_418332" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T23:16:27+00:00" title="July 14, 2013 11:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if you're asking for personal stories about how we approach playing the Fae? If I've misunderstood your question, please forgive!<br/><br/>My Fae sort of is a bit of a stickybeak. She pokes her nose into the business of people she's interested in being friends with. Particularly if they look like they need a shoulder. Most of her promises are as a result of someone being "troubled" and getting them to promise to tell her if... (usually something to do with "if so'n'so bullies you again" or "if there's anything I can do to help you"). It's very, very natural because in conversation where she's obviously concerned and trying to help, it doesn't seem "off". It seems like one of those things people say and don't really mean and I've got plenty of NPCs and two of the other three PCs to almost reflexively agree to promise her <i>something</i>. A few (and a <i>very</i> few here, unusually enough) were given in response to flirting/seduction. <br/><br/>I don't push, generally, to get them to break promises or set them up to break promises to her. In fact, the only person who almost did managed to correct herself before my Fae realized she hadn't been told about being bullied. (Which was fine by me because my Fae didn't specify a time limit like "right away" or "the next time you see me" and hadn't found out it happened before she was told, so she didn't have the chance to be angry.) But I already have an idea in mind that she will push if she feels particularly threatened or betrayed by someone. Of course, just about everyone she would have pushed back on has been murdered, so...<br/><br/>Of course, this is appropriate for <i>this</i> Fae. All she really wants is a lot of interesting friends. Her intentions are almost pure in this sense. The other PCs are sort of conflicting with each other, but my Fae hasn't really made enemies yet. I can't see her "innocence" lasting out the next game session, though. And, as has been hinted with her reactions to some of the boys she was flirting with and lost interest in because they were boorish to her, she's not the gentle Blue Fairy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson" title="Axkidson"><img alt="Axkidson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson">Axkidson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419140/#Comment_419140" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T16:26:15+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  4:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok clearing this one up ... do you guys rely on wording for promises ...

On one end, you have the idea that Faeries are constantly out to get people; that they are specifically trying to lure people into making promises (maybe even impossible promises) and that only a very foolish mortal would ever promise anything to a Fae. This is the mode where whenever someone (usually an NPC) says 'I promise' in-game, everyone at the table chortles evilly and is like 'ha ha what a sucker' because OF COURSE it is going to end poorly for them. This is also the mode where players go out of their way to have characters avoid promising things, or vice versa; i.e. a promise is seen as a sort of drama-tool that operates distinctly from any other social obligation. The idea here is that 'a promise' is like a spell, similar to knowing the true name of a demon or something, and so it is subject to a sort of legalism/mechanistic framework that is usually developped as an in-fiction thing that the Fae is aware of.<br/><br/>Personally I think this is kind of terrible, but it has lots of great genre backing (Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell comes to mind, and plenty others.) These are the Fae of a certain kind of faerie story.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's a scale, but I prefer to trend my Fae very hard in the direction of the underlying social inspiration for the Skin; i.e. a teenager who takes everyone very seriously at their word, and is in many ways the OPPOSITE of conniving. The naive Fae doesn't angle for promises or trick people into making unreasonable promises; they just really trust their friends to do what they said they would, and they want people to commit to things. <br/><br/>Now of course these two can be combined, but most commonly they are combined by having the former be the player's attitude, and the latter be the character's personality -- i.e. the PC is oh so naive but meanwhile the players are all chortling about the certain Faerie doom, etc. <br/><br/>To me this really sells the whole thing short. A broken promise should not be seen as a sort of dramatic inevitability, a cosmic revenge scenario that was certain the moment the poor hapless NPC agreed to do something. Is this how it felt to you in high school, when a friend broke their word? Did you sit around waiting for your friends to screw up so you could judge and punish them? Because that's not the Fae, that's the Fae's darkest self, and taking it as a foregone conclusion seems to me to be stripping some of the horror out of the PC. It leads to aloof, manipulative Fae whose only skin in the game is their ability to fuck people over.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson" title="Axkidson"><img alt="Axkidson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson">Axkidson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419148/#Comment_419148" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T19:59:00+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  7:59PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They only mark XP if you have the "lure" move ... i had a pc not take that move                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419160/#Comment_419160" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T22:18:54+00:00" title="July 28, 2013 10:18PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the consequence of the promise in the move they took?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419652/#Comment_419652" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T15:15:40+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  3:15PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then I would ask: "Do I get a string on him?" and if the GM says "yes", then they promised, even if the player didn't think so.  Monsterhearts isn't a game where absolutely everything your character feels is 100 percent  under your control. You, the player, may have been trying to be weaselly and boring and not-quite-promise, but some sudden jump in your heart meant that for some reason it was absolutely real in that moment and now it will stick with you forever.<br/><br/>If you ask "do I get a string on him" and the GM says "no", then they didn't promise, but you absolutely ought respond as if they had and have your fucking heart BROKEN because he SWORE and you TRUSTED HIM and start Manipulating NPCs to distrust and hate them because of their broken promise, and Shut Someone Down if anyone else tries to trust them, etc.<br/><br/>Just pretend the promise was made no matter what, it's fine, it will work.  The gamer "I'll make a wish that's not really what I want because it will always be a monkey's paw wish that turns on me and kills me" and "I'll make a promise that's not really a promise because then I'll be able to back out of it without consequence" strategies only work in games with no emotional reality. In the real world this attitude leads to 100 percent of everyone considering the not-really-promisor a cowardly asshole.  Fortunately, Monsterhearts follows emotional reality in its Basic Moves, so stick with that and it will work fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
