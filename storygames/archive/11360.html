In computer games and animation it's sort of understandable as a budgetary and/or technical concern, but 3d stills in lieu of drawn art seem rather cheap for most any other application to me.<br/><br/>Of course it's a matter of taste, I guess. Given time I'm sure 3D style becomes its own thing - has probably already become its own thing among some younger folks, now that I think of it. I don't know how much of a niche there is in roleplaying for the style - is there a genre where 3D art is a natural choice, or is there an audience that simply likes the style? Or is 3D practically always a cheap choice made out of budgetary concern or simple artistic blindness?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252453/#Comment_252453" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T02:10:11+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  2:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 2:13AM by Destriarch.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3D art is an awkward thing to get just right, and there is a lot of prejudice against it in RPG circles. Don't know why, maybe people feel that computers are impinging enough upon RPG's traditional territory. Most likely though, it's simply because most 3D art used in books isn't very good. Someone gets their hands on a copy of Poser and a few free models, slams them inexpertly into stiff, unsuitable poses and, most commonly in my experience, doesn't know how to use the camera to make it look dramatic.<br/><br/>Yes, I may be biased since I am a 3D artist of limited talent, but I can spot the common mistakes that others make and the big one is style. 3D models invariably end up looking like emotionless barbie dolls because a) human skin is hard to do, and b) so are realistic facial expressions, so most people leave them at default. I mean look at the example link kindly provided above. Not one of those images is even smiling! They look like shop window dummies. The generic models you get also tend to lack a lot of character. They're too perfectly human and too average.<br/><br/>Another mistake I think is to concentrate so closely on the models that you forget about the atmosphere of the image. Depth-of-field effects can do wonders, as can volumetric lighting, proper use of shadows and so on. And then there's cel-shading filters that make the images look like cartoons, those can (under the right circumstances) be a boon too. You have to tailor the atmosphere of the image to match the product you're illustrating or it will look terrible.<br/><br/>So yeah, I agree that the dislike of 3D art is mostly due to its association with crappy Poser images used by people on a budget who can't afford the time and effort it takes to individualise the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252454/#Comment_252454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T02:10:35+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  2:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pretty much hate 3D CG art with every fiber of my being.

The trick here is that it's much easier to produce LOTS of bad 3D art, in less time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really unsettles most people, I think, is mostly "obvious Poser + stock textures 3D art", not 3D art in general. Heck, if 3D art is at the level of quality of the stuff I sometimes see on cgtalk, or say in Avatar, well bring it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the linked art is, as I just said, just some Poser models with some random clothes on (if any), maybe in a simple 3D environment, all with stock textures and unrealistic lightning. And that's not 3D art. That's 3D bad-videogame graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch better no art at all (and a stylish layout) than stock CG art.<br/>\n<br/>\n3D art is HARD to get right.<br/>\nLike all art, I guess.

One might draw a comparison with, say, oil-painting or architecture; the oils and stones are not art, but the combination of them in such-and-such a manner - a finished product - could be . What defines a finished product (a thing, in exemplar cases, of great beauty) is the artist or designer's manipulation of these base materials into a unified, realised single element. Technological matter is transmogrified into an aesthetic whole.<br><br>Material is made beautiful, or wondrous (and thus 'art'), by the concealment of its manipulation. If we see a painting or building but cannot fathom at the effort, design or practice of creation we are filled with awe and appreciate it as art. If we see 'poor' art, and can guess at it's design or believe ourselves-as-audience could do better (regardless of truth) then this enchantment is broken and we despise it. <br><br> 3D CG is thus worthy of being called art (or rather, will be called art) when it reaches the point wherein in can mask its nature. The video Johnstone cites is the example of this - we are delighted by the way in which the creation mimics reality, or convincingly misrepresents reality as a believable imaginative structure. The majority of 3D CG is like viewing a building covered in scaffolding; ugly and in need of further work. <br><br>-Mike.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252461/#Comment_252461" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T02:59:10+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  2:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that opposite conclusion is just as obvious: "good 3D art is good". Of course it is, now just get some out there to fix the reputation of the form. At least one person in twenty right out of the street can draw nicer-looking illustrations than the 3D stuff out there (number based on observing high school art exhibitions over the years), so I guess I just don't understand the allure of the 3D in static imagery. An awful lot of trouble so you can still be a worse illustrator than a rough 2-3 high school students per class.<br><br>My own guess at this point is that 3D won't really show its strength before people have had time to attach enough emotional baggage to it. Once that amount of baggage combines with a sufficient level of technical skill, we'll start seeing some traction for the form - first in pornography, I guess, considering how practical use is already present in video games. I suppose the art style can then continue on to become the manga for the next generation - a familiar set of visual conventions that become powerful in expression and transparent in application for all sorts of powerful art. From what I've seen we're just not there quite yet; but then I wouldn't know, considering how I dropped off the 3D culture a bit over a decade ago when I stopped following new video game releases - when and if the form becomes a vector for powerful art, I'll likely lack the context at first to make sense of it, so I'll just go "Wah, that stuff's so shitty, dude! My granddaughter draws better than that!"<br><br/>(Let me clarify the above by saying that I do recognize that art is already being done with 3D imagery as a medium. However, the various WoW comedy videos and such do not really make use of 3D visuals as the art itself, but only as a visual shorthand that carries the literary element. We've yet to see 3D art that actually looks good for its own sake, the sort that you could put in an art gallery on the strength of the visual alone.)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252489/#Comment_252489" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T06:46:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  6:46AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All gaming art should be taken out behind the hobby and quietly shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252492/#Comment_252492" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:07:16+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the thing that occurs to me is that the pinnacle of 3D animation (IMHO) is Pixar, and if you look at anything 2D they do (notably their art books, and often the credits of their movies), it's at least as amazing as their 3D stuff. Kung Fu panda also had a great 2D animated opening sequence. Doing 3D stuff requires a specialized skill set, but I think doing good 3D art also requires a good foundation in the fundamentals of art. The principles of design, composition, color, etc. don't go away just because you're doing stuff in a computer.<br/><br/>With those crappy clipart collections, we're seeing people using 3D as a shortcut to producing pictures, rather than a medium through which to use their actual artistic talents. And with RPGs there are both budget limitations (a 3D artist who can produce high-quality stuff would be getting big bucks at an animation studio or video game development house, and out of an RPG designer's reach) and the fact that RPG books typically have black and white interiors that don't do justice to 3D art anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252494/#Comment_252494" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:13:53+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that high-quality 3D renders like with The Third And The Seventh are great for fantastical and sci-fi things, but in most cases, if something exists in real life it will be easier and cheaper to get an excellent photograph of it. <br/><br/>Also, sometimes the key to better 3D imagery is mixing your media.

That might make it an useful addition to a photograph artist's toolbox, just like Elizabeth mentions.<br/><br/>Then again, from what I've seen recently, it seems that certain high-quality studios have been putting in the hours in developing improved 3D techniques for replicating the strong points of traditional art, too. Cell-shaded Nintendo games of recent vintage are an obvious example, but Disney might take it even further soon - I seem to remember reading somewhere that the next Disney feature animation (Rapunzel, was it?) will achieve seamless 3D/2D coordination. I'll believe it when I see it, but if it's true and doesn't make too many compromises in the traditional strengths, then that'll open quite some opportunities for 3D art in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252560/#Comment_252560" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T10:12:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 10:12AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is that 3D programs are used as shortcuts by people who have zero artistic experience.

I've had years of studying design at university, worked with poser since version 2 came out (over a decade ago), I take care to incorporate dramatic camera angles (when needed), I play with lighting effects to actually make the figures fit in with their backgrounds (especially when I'm compositing a 3d form into a pre-rendered (or photographic background). I even try to use photoshop filters to give the images unusual effects, making them look like woodcuts, or layering up translucent combinations of watercolour effects and other filters to give images a less clean and sterile appearance.<br/><br/>The example image accompanying the original comment is clearly a pre rendered background with a post rendered figure, where the artist hasn't cared anything for lighting or other effects to make the image convincing (either they didn't know how or couldn't be bothered).<br/><br/>I'll admit that the original comment fits the discussion from which it was drawn; given that the original context of the quote related to the craziest things found in the Haiti Bundle, and many other comments also stated that the bundle showed how low the PDF bar has been set in recent years. 3D graphics programs allow the illustration bar to be set really low, really quickly. <br/><br/>In much the same way that a free pdf converter sets the publishing bar low; comments to that effect have also been raised in regard to the Haiti Bundle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252638/#Comment_252638" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T13:32:48+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  1:32PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, RivoClavis, you said exactly what I was thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252720/#Comment_252720" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T20:06:58+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  8:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one's mentioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" rel="nofollow">Uncanny Valley</a> effect yet, which is the bane of all attempts at lifelike CGI depictions of humans. (But maybe everyone here knows about it, and everyone knows everyone knows, so they didn't bother to even name it...)<br/><br/>Throughout Pixar's films they've gotten better and better at rendering people by learning just how cartoony to make them to avoid this. The baby in "Tin Toy" is pretty horrifying (especially the drool!
