On our <a href="http://yellow-menace.com/2011/07/yellow-menace-gamecast-episode-5-jake-richmond-from-atarashi-games/" rel="nofollow">last episode</a> we interviewed Jake Richmond of Atarashi Games, and designer of Panty Explosion Perfect and GxB. We touched on the mechanics of the various games, mostly about how the new edition of Panty Explosion differs from the first - but frankly, I was more interested in the design goals behind PEP and GxB than the mechanics. Both of those games are designed to deliver specific kinds of gameplay based on fairly widespread anime tropes, and while there may have been some value in chatting at length about what dice are used and how the mechanics work, we were less interested in the nuts and bolts and more interested in hearing Jake's thoughts about genre emulation and the issues brought up by bridging the gap between the gaming and anime subcultures. In the case of GxB, there are very few mechanics to speak of.<br/><br/>Although we didn't explicitly describe the game's mechanics, I think our discussion gives you a good grip on whether or not the games are your cup of tea. We pretty thoroughly discussed the kind of gameplay the ruleset engenders and supports. If you really have a burning need to know the crunch, <a href="http://celstyle.com/store/index.php?act=viewProd&amp;productId=8" rel="nofollow">buy the book</a> - it's a modest $16 and I'm sure Jake would appreciate the sale. Failing that, we see each other at game meetups on a fairly regular basis - if you want to check out the book, I'd be happy to let you have a look at it next time I see you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334121/#Comment_334121" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T17:33:54+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  5:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Applause to Thadrine for crying out for more mechanics.
