I am hoping to get your assistance in finding the right system to draw my "old skool" gamer friends into the story game style of roleplaying.  It might help if I take a few moments to give you some background and share my initial thoughts about some games.  sorry for the length of this post but I figure more info can lead to better suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group consists of myself and two other players.  We are all professionals in on or over the cusp of 40.  We went to college together.  In collegePlayer A and I ran some GURPS campaigns.  All three of us played in several D&amp;D campaigns run by another friend. Once we left school the three of us ended up in the same city and continued gaming as a hobby.  We tended to focus on board and mini games such as Twilight Imperium and Warzone.  We played with a group that did not have interest in RPGS so we never really considered going there.  Time has whittled that group down to the three of us.  For the last several years Player A and I have been playing a lot of WOW.  Player B started playing WOW with us earlier this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n My interest in RPGS reawakened about 4-5 years ago and I have followed the Indie movement as it has developed.  I tried to get a Riddle of Steel game going about three years ago.  Players A and B participated in that effort and seemed to be enthusiastic about the general prospect of a roleplaying campaign. We got together to run a demo and my inexperience as a GM and my difficulty processing the system and making things move for the players really took the edge off.  Nobody explicitly said "this is boring I do not want to play" but the idea died a quick and quiet death. Player A is definitely ready to play and is well suited for a story game style experience.  Player B is a little more traditional and I am worried about hitting him with something that is too big a shift from what he has experienced in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a nutshell I am looking for a system that:<br/>\n1.  That has relatively simple resolution mechanics.<br/>\n2.  Has some connection to more traditional D&amp;D style games.  In particular I think player B will be more comfortable in a fantasy setting to start.<br/>\n3.  Gives the player some degree of narrative control without dumping the whole thing in the players lap.  I think Player B would not know what to do if he was constantly required to drive the narrative for his character.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are the games I am thinking about and my initial thoughts,I would really appreciate your input.<br/>\n<br/>\nA.  Burning Wheel:  In my mind the pros are that I own the game already and that I love how the BITS work in the system.  The cons are, I am not sure I am ready to GM a game with this much crunch.  I know that I can run it with all simple tests but I feel like that might wash too much of the system out with the crunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nB.  TSOY:  (I do not own this game) It seems that the pros are a simple resolution mechanic, cool setting and the Keys approach to narrative participation.  The con in my mind is that Clinton thinks the "sweet spot" for the game is in the GM + 3-5 players area.  I am also a little concerned that BDTP might be too much for Player B.<br/>\n<br/>\nC.  DITV:  (I do not own this one as well).  The pro appears to be the unified mechanic, intuitive escalation system and methodology for designing towns.  It seems like that it could be converted to a fantasy setting without much problem.  The con appears to be that game revolves around one type of story, would it be able to do the "young farm boy rises to save the kingdom" or other types of common fantasy story?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would you recommend?  What are your comments on my thougths and impressions of the games mentioned above?  Thanks in advance for your comments.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97737/#Comment_97737" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T05:49:18+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel really is desceptive.

I actually bought Reign and was planning on using it with these players.  I really liked the setting and the company rules.  For some reason the ORE mechanic just did not feel right to me, especially when it came to hit location in combat.  the lack of narrative devices really pushed me ot keep looking.  I think that Reign has a future on the table for this group but I feel like I need to start off with something more dramatic.[code][/code]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97933/#Comment_97933" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T13:57:51+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  1:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played REIGN yet, though I've read through the book, and from reading it I kind of like the look of ORE for combat.  I mean, it's hard to tell without actually taking it out and firing it up, but I feel like it might be able to give combat some tactical crunch while still keeping things moving fairly quickly.

TSOY: (I do not own this game) It seems that the pros are a simple resolution mechanic, cool setting and the Keys approach to narrative participation. The con in my mind is that Clinton thinks the "sweet spot" for the game is in the GM + 3-5 players area. I am also a little concerned that BDTP might be too much for Player B.<br/><br/>[SNIP]<br/><br/>So what would you recommend? What are your comments on my thougths and impressions of the games mentioned above? Thanks in advance for your comments.</blockquote>\nOf the three choices I heartily recommend TSoY. It's not only the closest to your goals, it's also the best of the three, IMO. It shouldn't be too much of a departure from traditional play. For one, a lot of the stuff that will influence play is built at chargen level. I have found that with hardcore traditional players, this is vital when introducing them to new concepts. Your players will not feel at loss during play and things should go smoothly. <br/><br/>BDtP is deceptive. At first, it might appear a bit intimidating as it puts extra focus and detail on a specific conflict. Then you realize that there are plenty of RPGs out there with more intrusive/detailed/complicated mechanics for everyday tasks and you start to relax. Also, while Clinton clearly explains how BDtP should be used, it's been widely houseruled by different users. Some making BDtP a more frequent occurance in their adventures and others completely dropping it. The core concept is not only nice but very easy to adjust for your own group. <br/><br/>TSoY comes with a setting that is fairly standard yet does have its own flavor. It'll be recognisable to anyone familiar with fantasy. You can easily adapt it to other settings, especially fantasy. Someone I know currently runs his Thieve's World/Lankhmar/Yrth hack with it and he says it's been one of his least painful conversion ever. I really think Clinton hit the sweetspot between traditional play and adding flavorful mechanics that empower players without feeling like a burden. It's also nice that the game is very elegant and not overly detailed. It's not difficult to prep, smooth in play and flexible. <br/><br/>Plus, it comes in two flavors (1st and 2nd edition) and both can be viewed for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98034/#Comment_98034" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T22:25:29+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 10:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2007 12:22AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Spirit of the Century would be fantastic starter, except its Pulp Action rather than fantasy.<br/><br/>Edit: As for Dogs, I think I would try to play it first with folks who've played it before.

Whisper me an email and I'll send it to you.<br/><br/>Also, I wouldn't worry about Player B and TSOY... My guess is, the fact that all the stuff at hand that might confuse (Bringing Down the Pain, Keys and such) will be mitigated by the fact that these elements aren't airy-fairy hand-waving affairs.  They're tied into the mechanics and <i>offer the player a bonus</i>.  That incentive makes them not something to "deal" with, but, after a couple of minutes of watching them in action, something to actively pursue.  I think Player B will plug into them right away.  I wouldn't try to "sell" him on these concepts.  Just lay out the rules.  His mechanical mind and the rules will be fast friends soon enough.<br/><br/>I also think <i>Burning Wheel</i> will work gangbusters for your group.  But given <i>your</i> concerns about BW, I think you should jump at TSOY.  In two reads of the rules you'll have it down cold, be able to explain it well, and  once play starts everyone will get the game and be behind it in about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus" title="Lexonus"><img alt="Lexonus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus">Lexonus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98238/#Comment_98238" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T18:11:29+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  6:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2007 6:12PM by Lexonus.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RichD</cite>On BW:  Duel of Wits is the first modular part I add actually.

Check the Evil Hat site for the links - there's web page and PDF too. I don't think you'd exactly have to strip the mechanics (the core would be fine), but you would probably want to tweak the skill list, revisit the number of Aspects and FP in play, think about how to handle large monsters (there was a good RPGnet thread about this, but I think it got into the FATE wiki too), look at whether combat is heroic/gritty enough for you (it's pretty hard to die in SotC, by design, but this can easily be fixed) and consider whether you need a different advancement system, at least. It's all tweakage, but there's quite a lot of it. There are quite a few conversions floating around, including a Traveller one, that you can look at to see how people go for more/less grit, etc.<br/><br/>As Andrew says, there's also FATE 2.0, and much of it is "mix and match", so if you don't like how SotC does something, 2.0 will often give you an alternative approach you can slot in. <br/><br/>You would also probably want to join the FATE Yahoo group (<a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/FateRPG/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/FateRPG/</a>) which is very active and full of good stuff.<br/><br/>There's no ETA on 3.0 - Evil Hat is taking a "done when it's done" line, AFAIK. I would guess shortly after the Dresden Files game comes out. But there's no ETA on that either!<br/><br/>I still think TSoY is front-runner, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98273/#Comment_98273" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T05:37:15+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  5:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2007 5:38AM by RichD.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly, Lex.  I would link you to the actual play thread on the Burning Wheel forum but the forum doesn't seem to be working well today.  The short version of her plotline is that she is a villiage tavern wench coming to the Big City in search of the noble she loves.  One of her beliefs is to obtain finery so she can pass into the noble areas of the city.  So the first part of the game is your usual search for stuff and interact with people.  She tried to bluff and persaude the gate guards to let her in, hide the knives on her person that she shouldn't have, that sort of thing.  So that got her used to the basic skill tests and versus tests with other characters.  Then she wanted to find a place to work so she could make some money.  So that's where I put in wises to learn stuff about the city and Circles to find people you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she got to the tavern that was hiring, the tavern owner was interested in hiring this buxom beauty but the head barmaid would be damned if she let some young competition in the door.  So there was the Duel of Wits to convince the tavern owner to hire her with the older barmaid arguing against.  So she got the job and started working.  Then she tried to Circles up someone that knew her noble love and failed.  So she learned about the Emnity Clause and got a relative that would never see his cousin married to a bar wench.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Resources came in and I explained to her that no matter how eternally long she worked here, her resources would never go up unless she deliberately went out and made them go up.  So she circled up the gate guard that hit on her and off she went to the gambling halls.  After the gambling, they were accosted by a thug hired by the hateful cousin and out came the Fight script.  I deliberately scripted the thug stupid but it was still a tricky fight.  We even got to do a round of Range and Cover because the thug ran after failing a Steel test and she wanted to use her throwing knives to bring him down.  Got him between the shoulder blades with a Superb as it happens.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSo now she's pretty much tried everything at least once so it will be familiar when it comes around again.  Now most of the checks came about naturally in the course of play as opposed to me having a master plan.  The only deliberate order I had in mind was that she try a Duel of Wits before she tried Fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus" title="Lexonus"><img alt="Lexonus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus">Lexonus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98287/#Comment_98287" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T08:30:23+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  8:30AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew and Dave<br><br>Thanks for the FATE thoughts.
