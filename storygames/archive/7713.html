Having played a lot of pick-up Traveller over the summer, I've become enamored of the style of play that was employed: quick, collaborative setting generation enabled by having to rationalize random-table rolls, situation emerging from the interaction of character with setting, and mildly agonistic play with an eye toward the dramatic. Really fun stuff. Porting that over to a fantasy setting has the same sort of appeal as Red Box Hack and other story-oriented hack &amp; slash games.<br/><br/>The neat thing about my version of Wanderer is that I take seriously the notion that the life-paths of character generation ("terms" in Traveller) are "quests," framed in the idiom of the Campbellian hero-journey. So instead of enlistment, promotion, survival, and so forth, you have e.g., Initiation, Departure, Testing, and Return. Success or failure at each stage naturally has consequences for the rest of the quest.<br/><br/>The other fun thing that I envision is rules for creating the "domain" or region you'll play in the same way you'd generate a Traveller sub-sector. <br/><br/>It's a fun thought experiment, at any rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171427/#Comment_171427" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T06:54:21+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  6:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Jason MorningstarAra, can you explain what you are up to here?

The resolution is 2d6 + modifiers, roll 8+. The random tables are there along with an alternate lifepath (players choice) system based on the tables.

Did you use the combat system as written?  How did it run for you?<br/><br/>Did you use the Task Resolution as suggested in the rules?  How did it go?<br/><br/>I'm starting up a <i>Traveller</i> game on Sunday, but porting the classic GDW setting to modified <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> rules.  Everything you mentioned about how your <i>Traveller</i> play went is <i>exactly</i> the qualities I'm planning on engendering in the upcoming game.  I'm curious how the CT rules worked for you.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'm finding that the port to <i>Sorcery &amp; Sword</i> was strangely easy.  Like you guys there's something about how I see <i>Traveller</i> (and the <i>Traveller</i> universe) that makes it easy to see the underlying structure of the tone and feel as if it'd be easy to flip it back and forth between the two kinds of color.<br/><br/>I'm going to be keeping the random generation of worlds from Traveller, as well as the military feel of the PCs getting mustered out, the basic setting of the Spinward Marches and so forth.<br/><br/>But, Bill, I'd really like to hear more about how your games played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171437/#Comment_171437" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T07:49:44+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  7:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spirit of the Far Future (Traveller ported over the Spirit of the Century)<br/>\nhere: http://phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Spirit+of+the+Far+Future                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171468/#Comment_171468" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T09:46:09+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  9:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played fast and loose with the rules, though we generated worlds and characters pretty much by the book. The system we wound up adopting involved aggressive scene framing to figure out what the overarching challenge of the scene was, and then mapping out the sequence of successful die rolls needed to achieve that objective. So if you were trying to board a disabled merchant ship and take off some cargo before the space patrol showed up, that might involve 5 or 6 steps, the success or failure of which could influence your chances at the next step. Combat was handled abstractly; "taking a hit" was occasionally a consequence of failure (and we did have a character die as a result). The thing we figured out early was that you had to require narration/dialogue to accompany each player's roll. It became very engaging.<br/><br/>So we retained "task resolution" by explicitly locating each task within a larger sequence of tasks whose completion determined the success or failure of the overall effort. You could say it was impressionistic task resolution, rather than realistic per se.<br/><br/>You can hear excerpts from our Traveller play and us talking about it on my brother's actual play podcast <b><i>Virtual Play</i></b> on <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=60" rel="nofollow">Episode 31: Origins Replay</a> (the first 15 minutes or so) and <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=62" rel="nofollow">Episode 33: Dexcon Recap, part 2</a> (starting about 2:20 in to about 16:00).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171475/#Comment_171475" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T10:13:13+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 10:13AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 10:13AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bill,<br/><br/>Thanks!  That's... uh, pretty much what I expected actually!  I think the character creation and world creation are magic.  It's the resolution parts that always seemed kind of gummed up.<br/><br/>Another question, based off of another thread around here: Let's say the Players failed to have their PCs board the merchant ship.  What happened?  Now, it sounds like that if they failed on steps 1 through 4 some new, interesting element would arrive that would then shift the focus to new resolution.  Is that correct?<br/><br/>And then the second question is, what happens if you made it all the way to step 5 or 6 -- and you still failed?  The PCs, having done all that, are -- what? -- stuck on the merchant ship with a lot of cargo?  Or what?<br/><br/><br/>Ara,<br/><br/>I've downloaded and read the Spirit of the Far Future books -- and was really impressed!  However, SotC doesn't float my boat the way it does for others.  It's good!  But the reasons are probably more about me than the game, so it's not worth getting into!  (In short: the Aspects seem to slide any game toward a whimsical -- and good! -- nature that I don't want for my <i>Traveller</i> game.  I know that the guys on SotFF addressed this.  I'm just more comfortable with my <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> port to deliver the goods I want.)<br/><br/>A year ago I was toying around with a <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> port.  But realized -- as has been discussed recently -- that much of the <i>Solar System</i> is about the fun of moving your character's abilities forward and a pretty good clip.  That, again, isn't the feel I wanted for <i>Traveller</i>.  My view of Traveller's PCs is that they are who they are in terms of abilities.  They've mustered out, older, experienced and kind of... done... unless they decide to change something about their lives<i> through the fiction</i>.  That alone is the reward.<br/><br/>I'll be hammering out the final details of the rules with my Players on Sunday and post the means by which we created characters somewhere around here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171478/#Comment_171478" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T10:26:56+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 10:26AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another question, based off of another thread around here: Let's say the Players failed to have their PCs board the merchant ship.

Is that correct?</blockquote>\nSometimes. More often it's like early failure makes later success harder: the PCs are digging themselves in. So a failed roll in an early step usually means there's a penalty to one or more later steps. But an early roll could also be a branch point between the hard way and the easy way (which would "shift the focus to a new resolution," absolutely). Or it could mean the PCs just don't get what they want and have to live with that. \n<blockquote>And then the second question is, what happens if you made it all the way to step 5 or 6 -- and you still failed? The PCs, having done all that, are -- what? - stuck on the merchant ship with a lot of cargo?

Or the space patrol starts chasing you (and may catch you). Or somebody tumbles out an airlock (resulting in a penalty to the getting away clean roll if we have to go out and get him). Or what have you.<br/><br/>So failure doesn't end the story, necessarily--it just ramps up the stakes until eventually we are talking life-and-death, which players sometimes lose.

Just a statement of Task and Intent with the Consequences stated up front.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am guessing from Bill's writing and my own experiences with Traveller is that there is an assisted narrative component for character creation thought the use of tables. This becomes more powerful when all the players are creating characters together. You'd pick one situation and all players roll their survival (Testing in Wanderer). The players narrated what happens based on their success or failures. <br/>\n<br/>\nara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171523/#Comment_171523" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T12:55:00+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 12:55PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that I've been thinking about this game design stuff intently for a few years, my observation is that it doesn't always take much in the way of a mechanical change to make a huge effect in play.  But that might just be me.<br/><br/><br/>As for creating PCs together: <br/><br/>I just read today that the Mongoose's <i>Traveller</i> ties PC character creation incidents together (kind of like SotC does with their character creation process.)<br/><br/>I'm already planning that for my Character creation session this Sunday.<br/><br/>As I wrote to my players: <br/><br/><i>Several assumptions exist for your characters:<br/><br/><b>Your character has recently mustered out of a military service</b><br/>He is trained, experienced, and battle tested. He might be in his 30s, 40s, or 50s after a distinguished or<br/>undistinguished military career. Now that he has left the service, what will he do with his days? What will he<br/>see as a worthy activity? Given that your character is versed in combat, experienced in war, trained for battle \u2013<br/>what will he choose to do now that his life is his own?<br/><br/><b>Your characters are bound together through military service</b><br/>Whatever ambitions or threats or unresolved business your character is focused on, you know you have each<br/>other\u2019s backs in a way no one else in the Imperium ever will. You know each other as brothers-and-sisters-inarms,<br/>having fought, survived and protected each other. The definition of HUMANITY for this game is<br/>FRIENDSHIP. The friendship between the Player Characters is what the game is about.</i><br/><br/><br/>While I won't be using the tables, I will be using four year terms to establish history and backstory.  As the Players generate the details of their PCs, we'll all be sewing them all together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171565/#Comment_171565" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:34:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of Mongoose Traveller is available as a free download as the Traveller Standard Reference Document on their website.<br/>\n<br/>\nara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171566/#Comment_171566" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:46:11+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:46PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zoinks!<br/><br/>Thanks for that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171660/#Comment_171660" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T06:58:13+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  6:58AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>But it sounds like you guys have gone off the rails of Task Resolution (use this skill to see if you crack the code) which is how CT was built, and to Conflict Resolution ("You're PCs are trying to do such and such, and NPCs X, Y, and Z have a vested interest in stopping you...

The task list is explicitly laid out, with specific skills enabling each task, and one player takes responsibility for making the die roll for each task. A failed roll either penalizes subsequent rolls ("It takes longer than you thought to open the doors! Your window of opportunity is closing! Minus 2 to all rolls from here on out!") or obviates the rest of the sequence, spinning the whole thing off onto a new tangent ("You can't get the doors open! You're going to have to find a different way in! What do you do?") <br/><br/>So it's the entire sequence of rolls that resolves the conflict. It's not the case that any given roll is regarded as a clash of interests per se. Although I suppose that the level of detail is abstracted enough that each roll resolves a specific intention rather than a "task" as such. But I just wanted to clarify that we're not really assigning material agency to the adversity the characters experience. As Ara suggests, it's just a matter of articulating the consequences up front.<br/><br/>And Mongoose Traveller is worth taking a look at for how it tweaks CT in character generation. It lets you change careers or just be a "drifter" rather than submit to the draft, includes life events and mishap tables, and gives groups of characters access to skill packages to ensure that a playing group has all the skills it needs to, say, run a starship. But I like your idea, Christopher, of explicitly stipulating that PCs have been bound together by their prior service. That's pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171663/#Comment_171663" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T07:34:25+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  7:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bill,<br/><br/>Got it on your resolution system.  I have more questions about it, but without playing it, and most likely sitting down and talking face to face, I'd be making far too many assumptions.  So I'm going to bow out of that for now.<br/><br/><br/>Character creation: characters bound.  Yes.  I'll be posting the details of the game after character / situation creation tomorrow, but I'm really excited about this.  I feel like I'm finally going to be getting the Traveller that I always wanted from the game.  (It's actually heavily inspired by the movie, "The Man Who Would Be King" -- with two guys who leave the army of the British Empire after having served in India, and go off into the untamed wilds around Afghanistan to make their fortune.)<br/><br/>I'll be using the rules for <i>Sorcerer</i>, and Sorcerer has a Humanity mechanic.  Basically, on a scale of one through ten, you track a PCs Humanity.  Each group defines Humanity for their story.  Ours will be Friendship, so the idea of friendship will be front and center -- between the PCs and between the PCs and NPCs.  If they do things that strengthen friendship, the make a role to see if their Humanity goes up.  If they do things that betray friendship, the Humanity might go down.  There's no penalty or bonus to high or low friendship; nor does it control behavior in any way like the Vampire Humanity rules.  However, if the PC reaches 0 Humanity, he's no longer "human" enough to be an PC and the GM takes over.<br/><br/>So, this puts this idea of friendship front and center in the game and the story.  So the game will be about how these characters are there for each other, or not; and what it even means to be there for each other.  Each will have their own agendas and personalities, but they're all decide to be there for each other -- because how can you not be for the guy you fought alongside?  Even if he's getting really greedy?  Or putting your life in danger for the woman he loves?  Or is about to blow the whole operation because he just spotted the guy who killed his father?  Or whatnot.<br/><br/>Since my players are really good about mucking up situations for great story content, there will be questions of what to do with loot or women or ambitions -- that will only get us into the terrific trouble and torn loyalties.  When you wrote: "...situation emerging from the interaction of character with setting, and mildly agonistic play with an eye toward the dramatic," I was nodding my head, thinking, "Exactly!"<br/><br/>I am so looking forward to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171665/#Comment_171665" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T08:20:39+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  8:20AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of putting friendship at the center of a Sorceror-based Traveller game.
