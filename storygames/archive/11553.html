We just wrapped up our setting concept submissions on Saturday, and site members can submit reviews of the submitted concepts this week. The reviews are really a measure of how interested you are in contributing and what you think of the general concept. It's a pretty diverse set of RPG setting concepts. If you are interested in collaborating on a large project to potentially break into the industry, this is a great opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257476/#Comment_257476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T19:08:09+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  7:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>I really like developing settings, situations and thematic content for games. I excel at describing the game that I want to play. I can write fairly well. I have some professional training in both communication and hands-on teaching, and can bring that expertise to a project.<br/><br/>I suck at designing systems which do what I say they do. I don't have a head for math, I can't focus on detail-oriented work (especially when we're talking about refining material that I've been working with for a year, like late-stage game development), and I don't have an intuitive sense of mechanical crunch.<br/><br/>I'd love to work with people who wanted to take my ideas and make them into tangible things.<br/><br/>Thematically/premise-wise, I want to design games about:<br/>real people learning to see themselves in a new light, coming of age stories, cutesy fantasy, bizarre &amp; dark wonderland mystery, resource-starved community building.<br/><br/>Mechanically, these are the games I'm interested in:<br/>focused designs, narrativism-supporting systems, games that prioritize goals and beliefs (Keys, Beliefs, Agendas, etc), simple games.<br/><br/>See past work: Perfect, Ribbon Drive<br/>See current projects: <a href="http://heartofashes.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Heart of Ashes</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
