<p>After the bit of awesome help I got here in relabeling "Creepiness" I thought I'd weigh in with another, slightly more cumbersome problem.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rpgjunkie74/infected.html" rel="nofollow"><em>the Infected</em></a> players regularly author locations, places they'd like their characters to go to relax or arm up or otherwise add to the story.  Each location has it's four statistics and one can author "sub-locations" to alter those statistics.  Sub-locations are kind of like nested locations.  They exist as part of the larger location that they're authored to modifiy.</p>
<p>For example;<br/>
A Location of Jim Bob's Army Navy might be authored to have a good supply of firearms.  Another player might then author a sub-location within Jim Bob's Army Navy called The Back Room and then author it's statistics so as to make Crazy Weapons (explosives, rocket launchers, KatanaChucks, etc) available.</p>
<p>It's one of the niftiest features of the game.  But the issue is the lableing.  Some rules affect the 'base' location (Jim Bob's in this case), some rules affect the specific sub-location (The Back Room),and some rules affect the entire area (the location and all it's sub-locations).</p>
<p>So, what I'd like to do is to re-label the Base Locations, Sub-Locations, and Areas, into something a little more palatable.  Something that's maybe a bit more thematic and maybe something that slides off the tongue a little easier.  As there are cards in play that need these labels, something with fewer letters would be a wonderful bonus too.</p>
<p>Any ideas, brainstorming, or spitballing would be appreciated.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>

                            On the surface it seems like a really nifty idea.  The problem I'm having with it is that it crosses a line in my brain about the fiction and the mechanisms.  I enjoy the idea of the mechanisms pointing out a movie-making process but I want the fiction that results to be the film.  I fear that this particular style of lableing, or maybe just those words in particular, would cross that border.  Kind of like when you're watching a film and the camera accidentally shows the microphones or an unfinshed side to the props.<br/>
<br/>
Lemmie see if I can illustrate what I mean.  Let's take "Lot" to replace "Area", or a Location and all it's sub-locations.  If a GM's card (or any other rule) were to read "This rule affects the entire Lot", then what kind of effect would that have on the imagined space of, say, Bob's Army Navy?  Would you be likely to still imagine all the same aspects of the store?  Would it affect how you imagined what was near and around the store?  The people or things that occupied the store?<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that I'd suddenly be imagining set-hands hiding behind fake walls, a lack of ceilings, and FX guys waiting with handy buckets of viscous fake blood to dump onto the protagonists.  Which just isn't the image I'm looking to provide for the game.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, examining film production terms might just lead to other terms that wouldn't cross that particular line in my head.  Something that tells the players to treat the game like they're constructing a film, but without shining a light on the guy behind the curtain.<br/>

                            It seems like you have an unneeded layer of complexity here.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of an "Area" that encompasses one "Location" and several "Sub-Locations," might you not have an "Area" that simply contains several "Locations?"<br/>
<br/>
In your example, "Jim Bob's Army Navy" would be the Area, with its rules about obtaining weapons. It begins with one default Location (say, the Sales Floor) that has no rules modifiers to the Area. Locations like the Back Room, added later, have the option of including those rules modifications.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I dunno -- Position, Trench and Foxhole?                        </div>

                            Well, here's the thing Adam;<br/>
<br/>
Areas don't get authored.  Locations and Sub-Locations do.  But some rules affect all the characters in a location and it's sub-locations and some rules only affect a Location and some rules only affect a sub-location.  I've only been using 'Area' to designate "A Location and all it's sub-locations".  <br/>
<br/>
And if you already grok'd all that from my previous post, then all I can tell you is that the layers of complexity seem to be working out just fine so far in playtest.<br/>

                            I don't doubt that they've been working out fine in playtesting. I was simply exploring an idea for making them work even better -- and make them easier to name in the process!<br/><br/>Questions:
<ul>
<li>Do players <i>implicitly</i> author an Area when they author a Location? An Area and a Location are the same thing if there are no Sub-Locations yet, right?<br/></li><li>Could a rule affect a <i>specific</i> or <i>singular</i> Sub-Location, but leave other Sub-Locations alone?<br/></li><li>Could a Sub-Location impose zero rules adjustments to its parent Location?<br/></li></ul>
I agree with you that Lot / Set / Set Dressing would evoke imagery that doesn't seem to fit a survival-horror game.<br/><br/>So for a military motif, try Position / Base / Post. For medical-epidemic imagery, perhaps Zone / Ward / Cell. For a video-game feel, Level / Map / Secret.                        </div>

<p>Ooooh.  I get what you were going for now.  I totally misunderstood.  Now that I get your meaning, I'll address it a little better.</p>
<p>The 'nesting' is important to me.  I like the borders that the base location provides for the fictional safety area.  I think that getting the players to get more and more specific about a place they want to explore is a great feature to the game.</p>
<p>And now to answer your bullet questions in order;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes.  Yes.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Yes, but currently unlikely to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>All your suggestions are interesting, but nothing's pushing my happy-button right now.  I'm now making wrinkly-faces like a toothless old man with a love for sour applesauce.</p>

                            I've been totally shooting from the hip. So I read the PDF and that helped quite a bit!<br/><br/>I think Location is the key element to name here. Let's assume for the moment that most Areas will be buildings (although naturally the rules allow for different kinds of Color).<br/><br/>"Area" is easily understandable: it's the whole of Jim Bob's Army Navy. It's the building, with all the rooms in it.<br/><br/>"Sub-Location" is easily understandable: it's a Back Room or a Lavatory or the Basement. It's a room or a section of the building.<br/><br/>"Location" is... both? But different? I think once you get the name for this, the others will fall into place.<br/><br/>It feels kind of like Location should be the room via which you enter the building. When I author Jim Bob's Army Navy, let's say I frame a scene of breaking into the sales floor through the front display window.<br/><br/>Maybe a good term would be "Threshold." It's the place where you cross from Everywhere Else into this Area (Site, Location, Map). It is the first room where you realize the rules are different here. Sub-Locations (Chambers, Cells, Rooms) are what you encounter beyond the Threshold.<br/><br/>So at this point I'm fond of Site / Threshold / Chamber.<br/><br/>Applesauce?                        </div>

<p><code>So I read the PDF and that helped quite a bit!</code></p>
<p>Right on.  Was it mostly comprehensible?  I mean, I know the grammar and spelling sucks in that printing, but did it seem like you could imagine what a player is supposed to do during the course of the game?</p>
<p><code>Applesauce?</code></p>
<p>Nope, not this time.  This time you got close enough to what I'm looking for to spark some inspiration in my noggin'.  Now that you've had a chance to read over the PDF, I'll ask your opinion on the labels I'm about to present.  They seem cool to me right now, but after some sleep I may reconsider.  A few others' opinions will help me determine if the following words are going to get the reaction I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Haven</strong></p>
<p>The replacement for Location.  These are places that the PCs can stop running from the monsters for a moment, get a breath and find the supplies that they'll need to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Den</strong></p>
<p>The replacement for Sub-Location.  The places within a Haven that are presumably more or less of something than the rest of the Haven.  More well stocked, less dangerous, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong></p>
<p>It's pretty straight-forward, not too many syllables, and fits easy on a GM Card or character sheet.  I considered switching to Site, but I felt that the word had a few implications that might be a little limiting.  "An Area is defined as a Haven and all of it's attached Dens."  Sounds pretty good to my ears.</p>
<p>Also, I'm considering renaming the Final Stand Location to the <strong>Terminus</strong>.  Cuz that sounds way cooler and slips off the tongue way better than <em>Final Stand Location</em>.</p>
<p>Opinions?  Something you think might be even better?</p>

I thought the PDF was fairly comprehensible. It would most benefit from generous helpings of examples, naturally. Without those it's hard to tell whether my mental picture of play is accurate or not!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I'm unclear on is how the content of narration and dialogue will affect the choices you make in play. It feels like a Colorful board game thus far, like (one of my favorites) <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/prod/betrayalhouse" rel="nofollow">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Area and Haven are good. Den sounds awfully warm and cozy, though!<br/>
<br/>
Terminus is a great term. Its closeness to "Terminal" and "Terminate" make it nicely threatening.                        </div>

                            I'm right there with you, but "den" is wussy.<br><br>What about removing the distinct physicality of the sub-space and going for something along the lines of "feature" or "interesting bit"?  <br><br>Area &gt; Haven &gt; Cool bit of Haven (no name springs forth)<br><br>And is Haven right?  The place is not safe, exactly, and haven has very peaceful connotations.  Something more neutral might be stronger.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Den is warm, cozzy, and wussy?  See, that's why I put that shit up here.  When I think <em>den</em> I think;</p>
<ul>
<li>Den of Corruption</li>
<li>Den of Inequity</li>
<li>Den of Pain</li>
<li>Den of Bears (angry bears)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>And is Haven right?</code></p>
<p>Is Haven wrong?  The authored locations aren't very safe, that's true.  They have dangers and creepyness all their own.  But, thematically, the reason why a PC ducks in there is to get out of Everywhere Else and take a breather.  In my eyes all the word is missing is some kind of implication is;  "This is where we get stuff to kill monsters and confront each other instead."</p>
<p>Also, the sub-locations, or Dens (maybe) are gonna almost always be authored by the protagonist players, so usually they'll be somewhat um... better for the PCs and worse for the GM.  Some exceptions will occurr, like when a player has an Agenda that provides them with a Liability bonus die, but otherwise I'm imagining that most sub-locations are safer than their base locations.</p>
<p>Does that perspective have any effect on how you'd view the labels?  And better yet, does it inspire any better labeling ideas?</p>

                            I was a Cub Scout - den will never have anything but hot chocolate and knot tying implications for me.  Also, it is completely removed thematically from its super-set, Haven, if you use that.  "You are in the den of your haven" sounds really dumb to me.<br><br>I can't think about this right now!                        </br></br></div>
