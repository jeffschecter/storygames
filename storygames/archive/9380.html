You can get one for about $20 these days.<br/><br/>8gb is a sweet spot (as of May 2009, anyway; next year, "2 terabytes" might be the "sweet spot") of price and functionality.<br/><br/>I can organize my entire RPG PDF library, and keep most or all of them on this thing, and still take up less than 1 gig. <br/><br/>I can use the rest of the space to store gaming-related media: For our Tenra game, I dumped episodes of the Zatoichi TV show and the J-Drama "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erEU2UFEO_c" rel="nofollow">Edo Assassins</a>" (Hissatsu Shigotonin) to later watch on the PC to get some game background.<br/><br/>I use it to carry PDFs to work, where I print out character sheets and the like. I dump campaign notes, idle RPG design flailings, and cool concept art I find on the web to it.<br/><br/>To that end, I nominate the 4-8gb range USB flash drive as the single most useful tabletop gaming-related tech device. <br/><br/>What is your nomination?<br/>What do you do with your flash drive?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207932/#Comment_207932" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T10:17:11+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 10:17AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I uploaded John Harper, Carl Rigney and Jackson Tegu to my flash drive.

Mostly for bringing the files to the copy shop for printing stuff out (While we do have a printer, it's been "empty but we will refuel it soo" for ages now.), but after catching me a virus that way, I have switched to CD-Rs and just uploading stuff to my webspace and then accessing it over the internet to print it in the shop.<br/><br/>When I'm actually running a game or preparing to do so, the USB sticks won't suffice: Then I'll bring my laptop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208034/#Comment_208034" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T16:14:33+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  4:14PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most interesting thing about this thread is how the noise and grousing about laptops at the gaming table is utterly absent.

I'd love to see wikis and similar web-technologies used more in my daily groups, but at current, I'm the only one who seems intent on spending any real amount of my personal time on the computer, and none of the games we've played recently would have benefited much from collaborative online materials. <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually play with a laptop open, using it to take notes et al.

Not a big deal to  me, anyway, the more I think about it. nd, yep, I use a mechanical pencil every time I play.<br/>-----<br/>Ideas:<br/><br/>* Use USB key to pass detailed notes, clues, or general information to particular players (means everyone needs PC access). Could even password-protect each player's individual folder, so that the info dump could be unique for each, with one USB key, and meanwhile you can go on with running the session for the other players waiting to read their clues. Hell, I could see a LARP handling all kinds of stuff like that, including PC stat updates, with a cheap-ass key per player (surely they sell in bulk, now--can probably even get them with the LARP organization's logo on them, with sufficient quantities). Sure, this could also be done in a variety of online manners, but LARP (in particular) can suffer from lack of Internet access, but still have access to power for a bank of laptops.<br/><br/>* Keep every character you've ever owned on it, so you're ready to play just about any game on the fly. I still have a notebook with all my old PCs in it, but it's a BIT too heavy to tote to every single con and session.<br/><br/>* Online collaboration tools, in general, make it easy to schedule session, offload "downtime" work to outside of session time, and keep a central repository of game data. We've used a Yahoo or Google Group for just about every campaign in which I've played the last several years.<br/><br/>* Another LARP idea, about passing info: a USB key could be any number of in-fiction information sources that actually must be found in the playing area. Glorified envelopes with notes in them, but now the clues can be multimedia. Further, you can make a "real life" puzzle out of finding the info, if you have a HUGE and obscure directory structure. Or, hell, encryption that takes time to un-encrypt (as the zombies shuffle ever closer!).<br/>...And just WHO controls the access to the one in-game computer, and what do they want in return? <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/>* We've used Forums a LOT in LARP, for downtime RP and general chat. Works best for "real time" games where time between sessions is the same as in-fiction time between session, or else you get some odd continuity problems. The flip side is that folks who don't or can't keep up with the forums end up missing out on a LOT and are sort of flabbergasted by the things folks do once the game resumes. In-character forums are the worst for this sort of thing (out-of-synch play). But I've had a hell off a lot of fun winding folks up on them. It's also easy for a GM to play several NPCs at once, without the restriction on appearance and without having to struggle with being in more than one place at one time.<br/><br/>* YouTube has also been a boon for the gaming and in particular LARP world. MANY LARPs now run promotional videaos, or actually document a game in progress (often OOC, bu some play with the idea that there is an in-game journalist taking the videos). Makes a good reference for GMs (maybe not for players--depends on their in-fiction access to it), and a GREAT promotional tool to attract new players. The various Flickers and PhotoBuckets of the net offer similar, though less visceral, opportunities.<br/>-----<br/>More as I think of them tonight.

In order of my must have nominations:<br/><br/>1.  WIKI - used for campaign bible, all-purpose everything for the campaign goes here including PC doing/posting their adds to the campaign.  Most now can also upload files - including excel character sheets, word docs, PDFs, sound files/songs, images, etc...  Most are FREE.  I prefer Google Sites, many folk apparently use Obsidian Portal (Google Sites is much better though, even though it's not RPG specific).<br/><br/>2.  YAHOO GROUP -  or a Google Group or other free web group forum.  I make a new one for each campaign, we post weekly between-game thoughts and questions and most importantly talk about game schedules.  Yahoo Groups (and others) have calendars, file uploads, etc...<br/><br/>3.  iTunes Playlist - I make a custom playlist for EVERY campaign, simple and excellent.<br/><br/>4.  iPod -  I use my 80gig iPod to hold EVERY file I have including music.  Take back and forth exactly like a memory stick, plus playing my iTune playlists from it...<br/><br/>5.  the Computer - in general I've made it easy to do multiple cool things during game with my computers.  From checking Wikipedia or Google Images for info or pix  to  displaying images on my 42" TV screen to show maps or NPC pics, etc...  I also have my music playing from iTunes through my sterio.  Easy-peasy.  I'll toss my scanner and photoshop into this bag as well.  also:<br/>a.  my laptop<br/>b.  my TV screen<br/>c.  my PC desktop<br/><br/>6.  Wipe-boards - I bought a large magnetic wipe-board that I use as a table play surface to draw maps, etc...  I also made a custom Initiative magnetic wipe-board and printed custom magnets for each PCs name, then made dozens of blank magnets (laminated) to write/erase NPC names.  Pop them up on the Initiative board, move them around in correct initiative order. <br/><br/>7.  Beads - like the life bead stone from Magic the Gathering,  I've collected dozens of colors for a full box of beads - the work great for counters when minis are needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>lots of goodness.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209040/#Comment_209040" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T02:26:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:26AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 2:28AM by simjames.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have some plastic-and-rubber counter mats that I liberated from an old workplace when we accidentally ordered the wrong size.

I bought a new iPod before the last convention just so that I'd have convenient access to my music during the con. And these days I have playlists started for a bunch of different games, including genres that I don't currently plan to run - just in case I hear a perfect song for a Vampire game (or whatever) and don't want to forget. Gone are the days when I had to bring a handful of CDs to every game session.<br/><br/>And, of course, my trusty mechanical pencil.

I can just say what I was going to in a google doc and send a viewer invite to everyone and they can peruse at their leisure. Also, when I'm playing, I can do all my in-character notes and backstories and assorted wankery and share it with the GM that way.

Not ubiquitous, yet. Or what if only one person other than the GM brought a laptop? Pass the laptop (with USB key) around for 'secret info briefs" rather than having everyone log onto email, sift through their Inbox, read a few other emails while there, click a link, read that too, then log out and pass to the next person. Instead, double-click the "Bob" folder on the "F" drive and enter the password you were told by the GM before the game.<br><br>Anyhow... just an idea, not a Best Practice.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209712/#Comment_209712" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T06:34:14+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  6:34AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2009 6:36AM by AlexS.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">dropbox on a USB stick: interesting. How does that work when you're porting the stick between computers?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI was interrupted by a phone call, so I finished the message prematurely, and did not complete the description of the setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically under Linux, dropbox can be used without any special previleges, so you just run the dropbox scripts. Under Windows I could not really test because I only use Windows at work (where windows usage is forced down our throats) and on top of that the IT department blacklisted the dropbox website as a "peer to peer" application (quite irksome).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I had to use a roundabout way to synchronize files at work:<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/toucan" rel="nofollow">Toucan</a> to do the synchronization<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.netdrive.net/" rel="nofollow">NetDrive</a> to connect via webdav to the free 2 GB space provided by <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://mydisk.se/web/main.php?show=home" rel="nofollow">myDisk.se</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then use rsync to synchronize with the Linux running appliances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a hairy solution, but I <b>want constant access to my files</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">OMFG, you iz gotta be a CRIMINAL!!!1!one! 0.0</div>\n</blockquote>\nI know you are joking, but honestly, who would use an usb to store personal files without encrypting them? usb keys are easily lost or forgotten, so that would be just asking for trouble. Same goes for netbooks. They are so portable that using them without encryption is just reckless. If you use a netbook under windows, you can use TrueCrypt to encrypt the whole volume. Under linux you can use LUKS and dm-crypt.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Now if only somebody found me something with the ease of dropbox, but that would work with my own webspace instead of "the cloud"... *sigh*</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWell, if you have your own server, you could install <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ifolder.com/ifolder" rel="nofollow">iFolder</a>, an open source product that does the same as dropbox except for versioning, but with some added advantages (automatic data encryption server side, so that if you share a server with family and friends, you know NO ONE can read your personal files, unless you share them, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't have your own server, then I don't understand by what you mean with the "cloud". For me internet is the "cloud".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, all this is going to completely change again, as we're finally getting affordable flat-rate access from mobiles in Germany, so that the permanently on-line mantra is at last going to become a reality (when I think this has been standard in Japan for more than a decade...). Still, at least in the Munich underground you have no network access, which is precisely a time when you could go online, while waiting for the next train (on the other end, it would be a pain to have people talking to their phone all the time, so it's probably a good thing overall).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209717/#Comment_209717" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T08:51:32+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  8:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, in Milan (Italy) the phones work just fine while in the metro... but the data rates for mobiles are (to my knowledge) crazy :-/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
