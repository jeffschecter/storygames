I looked up the rules on my phone, found them, pulled out some fudge dice, and went to it:<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Birthday, Robot!<br/>\n<br/>\nK: []++ --- []+-<br/>\nThere was a robot, but he was rusty.<br/>\n<br/>\nB: []+- [][]- [][]+<br/>\nSo, for his birthday, he cried oil tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nM: --- []+-<br/>\nRobot ran faster than ever before.<br/>\n<br/>\nK: []+- []++ []++<br/>\nHe ran home and found rust-removal spray.<br/>\n<br/>\nB: []++ [][][] []+-<br/>\nRobot took a rust removal shower and scrubbed himself shiny.<br/>\n<br/>\nM: +-- +--<br/>\nRobot felt better than ever, so he baked his favorite cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nK: [][]+ ++- ++[]<br/>\nRobot put candles on his cake and lit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nB: ++- []++<br/>\nRobot looked and closed his eyes, but his cake moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nM: +-- []--<br/>\nRobot screamed and his cake jumped, screaming "don't eat me!"<br/>\n<br/>\nK: [][][] [][]+[][]- [][][]<br/>\nRobot was confused, but agreed, and they sat and talked and laughed.<br/>\n<br/>\nK: (12 coins)<br/>\nRobot was going to wish for more friends before the cake came alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nB: (5 coins)<br/>\nNow, he didn't have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nM: (5 coins)<br/>\nAnd Robot never cried again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe End.<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things that I noticed: we were very willing to share heads-up coins with each other to allow the storyteller to fit the number of words into the sentence they had in mind. Also, we only had one point where someone got more than four plusses or minuses, and she only had two coins at the time, so we only got one round with free words ("his" and "cake"), but that seemed to work out okay. Overall, super fast and fun and cute! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe played another game of HBR! shortly thereafter, with Anna Kreider, but that is a story for another day.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225183/#Comment_225183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T14:40:49+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  2:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whooooaa.

There wasn't really any out-of-story direction talk, but there was a little "I need two more words for my sentence - can you help me out?" to help things along the way. The game took maybe twenty minutes, including reading and working out the rules, and I don't recall any huge hangups on the idea thinky side. There was a little of that in our second game (which took about as long), but not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad you enjoyed our story so much!

I've played sessions that went for eight hours that failed to produce fiction of that quality. The poetic concision is really exciting to me.

Really? And here I was thinking about making it a little more refined like these Danbo pictures:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3425/3371780468_0d02dc9c25.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3555/3382132360_fe481fc543.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3492/3712787349_01fb91bfcb.jpg"/><br/><br/>We were thinking about making little papercraft robots, photographing them in these kinds of curious situations. It would be cute and easier to do than full illos, but doesn't have that rushed, notebook doodle look.<br/><br/>The other option is to make half of the book more of a coloring and activity book that helps you practice playing the game. There's a page from a he-man coloring book that I can't find at the moment, but it shows he-man and she-ra at the bottom of the page looking towards something enormous. But that whole part of the page is blank. The instructions for that page are to "Draw what He-Man and She-Ra see." That's something that could totally work for a game like this. The art can be simple coloring book drawings and then I can post people's cool artwork on a flickr set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225339/#Comment_225339" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T07:00:10+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  7:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one of the players in that game, I'll say that the only force I applied to the story with my words was to try and move it in a positive direction. My experiences with improv have taught me that scenes/stories from nothing tend to drift negative unless you stay mindful of being positive. When the story started out with a rusty, crying robot, sirens were going off in my head, "Pull up! Pull up!" That's why I introduced the rust removal spray, and then the cake, which we seized on (in part, thanks to Kristin buying "his" and "cake" as free words) as the focus of Robot's story. From there, the plot just flowed out, and we brought things to a satisfying ending. With a game called Happy Birthday, Robot!, I'm probably not going to want to go dark my first couple of times through, so I was glad that once the story's momentum was pointing in a positive direction, everybody rolled with it.<br/><br/>For the most part, we played the game as a variation on the old improv game, Word-At-A-Time Story, and didn't discuss our word choices before we made them. To be honest, it never occurred to me to do that, since dealing with the unexpected, but logical choices of others is a big source of the fun in games like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225349/#Comment_225349" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T07:42:27+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  7:42AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, that's some awesome insight and advice for how to play.
