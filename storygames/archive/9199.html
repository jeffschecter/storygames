The extra-dimensional fungus was technically a single being, iterated through many temporary bodies.<br/>It decided that Earth would function better if its systems were standardized and re-structured.<br/>It took the liberty of initiating this process for us.<br/>We didn't care one way or the other.<br/>After all, the overlords gave us our current virtual reality overlays, which we love and utilize daily (but would never become dependent on! Psssh!)<br/>The overlord/s (The Benefactors) had amazing technologies (some related to matter reorganization, some virtual reality...), and would give them out along with their orders for the restructuring of our world.<br/><br/>It's just... well, The Benefactors are an extradimensional fungal shamble, with alien views and technologies.<br/>Their orders make no sense to us, because we make no sense to them.<br/>And so we were often appointed to jobs we couldn't reasonably do, asked to perform tasks that were daunting and/or impossible.<br/><br/>But, despite our apathy, we were quick to work together. After all, we wanted to cash in on favours down the road... when the Benefactors sent us an order.<br/><br/>After being displaced (communities were often moved or re-organized), some people would snap or become hostile.<br/>There was a small but growing "fuck the orders, I'm going to live where I want to live", DIY, anti-establishmentarian movement.<br/>That's part of the DIY/Non-establishmentarian movement.<br/>The other part was that our previous corporations, etc broke down with the Benefactors frequent and bizarre restructurings. As a result, it was necessitated that we do a lot more as small groups, in small communities, with the resources at hand (which now included all of the Benefactors lovely technologies!)<br/><br/>So:<br/>Almost everyone is a virtual reality junky, and quite apathetic.<br/>Thus, no one really minded when we were taken over.<br/>The Benefactors are a fungal mass that are trying their best to systematize and perfect our societies.<br/>We're given crazy orders by the Benefactors, who don't really "get" humans that well.<br/>We band together to complete the orders, but out of fear of consequence, not initiative (we're apathetic but essentially obligated)<br/>Those who actually have the initiative to go out in the world and do stuff can really get a lot done, as people are pretty malleable to suggestion and command nowadays.<br/>We have cool technologies!<br/>Did I mention virtual realities?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
