El shopping listo GURPS has an insane catalog of sourcebooks and support to work with.  Double-entry bookkeeping HERO has a solid tradition of being the crunch-tastic supers game of choice.  Tristat and FUDGE, well, they're <i>free</i> so I don't know that they really fit into this question...<br/><br/>Point being, I'm idly hacking out a system which focuses on melodrama but is otherwise intended to take its focus from the gamers, similar to Universalis but leaning towards more trad roots.  I've seen a few posts/threads that suggest most gamers would rather hand-feed an irate badger than accept a generic system.  What's the golden bullet here?  What would make you want to give that sort of thing a chance - some solid, detailed house settings?  A number of scenarios?  Frazetta women on the cover?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146752/#Comment_146752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T18:37:55+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  6:37PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A universal system would have to really wow me with what it did that other games don't do.  For example, you could tell me that as the organizer of the game I could communicate my philosophical and stylistic vision for my campaign to the players using the game's mechanics and then be able to see a basic arrangement of key elements grow more complex and intricate with time.  I.E. Make your own tarot and see it play out like a fractal over a long period of play.  Another idea would be a universalis-like framework which told me how to switch games within the same context to get different experiences; like if I wanted to set it in the Dictionary of Mu it could tell me how to Wicked Age, Sorcerer, Dread, or Polaris various sessions, in some common framework.  So something with big wow factor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146753/#Comment_146753" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T18:39:06+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  6:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Veav</cite>What's the golden bullet here?</blockquote>\nFor me, it's "provide something new". After that, everyone is going to have their own little issues about what they think a generic game should look like, and have likes or dislikes from there that you can do nothing to control.<br/><br/>Ex: I have Gurps 4e. Played it once (played 3e a dozen times or so in the 90s). Got it because we were aiming to run a Firefly-esque game with one of my groups, but that fizzled. The Lite rules I dig, but otherwise Gurps feels to me like a cup of plain yogurt, but I guess that's to be expected as it was the king of generic systems, of which all other generic systems were inspired. Also, I don't like how Kung Fu works (but that's my personal likes/dislikes).<br/><br/>My current generic games of choice are RISUS and Savage Worlds:<br/><br/>RISUS: The "provide something new" was its ability to get me from "bullshitting about a concept with my friends" to "playing that very game" in Under 10 Fucking Minutes. There are flaws with it, certainly. And I am not too big on running it for long-term campaign games. But for what it provides for me, it is my go-to Generic Game when I want to run some Hot New Idea, Right Fucking Now.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds: Sometimes, I just want to throw down with some generic play! Fast fantasy in a Conan world. High Adventure in a space opera setting. Jungle adventures. I don't want to think about character issues or story crafting, I just want to run something where players bust down doors and ACTION! the adventure to death. SW works great for this kind of thing. It's very light. You can craft a complete character in under 5 minutes (On a whim, my friend timed me at 1 minute and 30 seconds for a "Malcolm Reynolds" style character for a Firefly game, and that included refrencing the book twice, and even adding equipment/weapons!). It handles action well, which I like.<br/><br/>Other generics, like Action System/Fuzion or others, I kind of see as "it's exactly like GURPS, but with a slightly different die mechanic; and more/less/equal amount of math". I aim for generics which aim to be generic (many kinds of games you can play), but still focus on doing *something* well. <br/><br/>So, whereas I thought my heart was closed to generic systems, it turns out that even within generic systems I have some that I go to for certain kinds of generic play. Huh. So, if your game does something generic, but in a different way, then I'll definitely give it a look.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146755/#Comment_146755" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T19:03:17+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  7:03PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part a generic system is a weapon of last resort when I have this neat idea in my head and (1) I can't find a more specific system to do it, and (2) I either don't have the time to or just plain don't want to try to design a new one for it.<br/><br/>GURPS leaves me cold. I really like Risus, for all the reasons Andy listed. Savage Worlds does too many of the things that DeadLands did that I dislike for <i>completely</i> irrational reasons. I see Fudge as more of a design tool than a game per se. Fuzion just doesn't do a lot of the things I'd like to do, and Tri-Stat rubs me the wrong way in certain places. I'm liking OVA for my current campaign, but I'm wishing I'd figured out something more intimately concerned with what I wanted to run. (And Zero Breakers, the game I was thinking of, has evolved into something that wouldn't work for that campaign...).<br/><br/>Basically, I'd want a generic system that lets me do more or less what I want with minimal work. Risus and OVA are the only ones that really do it for me right now, but I'd love to have more on hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146756/#Comment_146756" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T19:12:50+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  7:12PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *scribbling notes*  For the record, GURPS leaves me cold too.

What I should look to produce is not in fact a generic system, but a tasty focused system that lacks setting.<br/><br/>Right, that's the key. PTA, Shooting the Moon (which I don't think anyone mentioned) and Universalis aren't generic games. They're each about something. The mechanics of the game are designed to do something specific. Very likely, there is no such thing as a truly  generic game in this sense. Or if there is, it's probably not something you would really want to play.  <br/><br/>So as far as the original question goes, I can't think of anything that would make me want to try a generic system, if a generic system is something that tries to do everything without really having a point, theme or focus. If the game is just setting less, that's a whole different matter. Then it depends on what it actually is about. unWritten is a great example of a setting less game that I would happily play.

For me the system of choice is GURPS, not because I think it is the best system ever written, but because I and my regular group have played it often enough for it to be second nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had all been playing D&amp;D; (or Hero, or Tristat) for years then that would probably be the generic system we would go to, but since we have all been playing GURPS instead then it's GURPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would entice me to switch generic systems ... it would have to be something that had great power to be used for lots of different games, without a huge baggage of imposed playstyles and narrative approaches, *and* easy to learn, so it would be worth switching from a system I already know well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146832/#Comment_146832" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T05:27:19+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  5:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short answer: it has to do something different, or better, than Fate v3 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146881/#Comment_146881" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T10:09:52+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 10:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you had a chance to playtest it at all yet?

I've read bits of Burning Wheel.  I've actually played The Riddle of Steel.  I've skimmed over the various Conan and Elric licenses and so forth.
