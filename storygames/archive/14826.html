I have a detailed actual play report here: <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?560517-(LoA)-Swords-of-a-Dying-Empire" rel="nofollow">Swords of a Dying Empire actual play</a><br/><br/>But the gist of my experience with LoA is this;  It is somewhat crunchy, which is not a bad thing... not the best organization, but I play with a pdf that allows some searchability, which is nice.  And it works pretty damn well for what we are doing, sword and sorcery.   Now, I like FATE, I like Spirit of the Century, I like Diaspora, and I like Starblazer Adventures, LoA's kissing cousin.<br/><br/>Damage is far superior to SotC.  We get to Consequences faster, easier and that is the meat of the FATE damage system.  <br/><br/>Magic works for me just fine.  I have a PC who wanted to be a Priest of the God of Blood, and picking and choosing between the Life and Death magics, I'm very happy with that PC's "spell" set.  <br/><br/>I just used a massive, huge monster, the rules for that worked really well.  I was impressed.  <br/><br/>Weapons and armor are a little crunchy for me.  They can have Aspects and armor can absorb consequences, but then is rendered moot.  We've been using the armor just fine, but the way the FATE economy has been working, the PCs and me for the NPCs, have been using FATE to tap the character Aspects instead of something like a weapon Aspect... example:  Spear is +2 dmg, Long Weapon.  I need to go and re-read the section on weapons to see if I'm doing it right.  I'm 10 episodes in and I'm still learning the rules, here and there.  <br/><br/>Overall, I like the system's robustness.  It really is quite comprehensive in it's scope.  I would think it would handle Middle Earth really well.   Maybe better than any Middle Earth system I've played, I have not seen the One Ring system from Cubicle 7 yet.  But previously, my go-to game for fantasy, especially sword and sorcery would probably be Savage Worlds.  I like the magic systems in LoA much better than SW, and while i miss the tactics and dice of Savage Worlds, I LOVE Aspects and what they can do for making characters really unique and fun almost instantly.  My group seems to understand the narration slant of FATE and seems to like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337430/#Comment_337430" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T09:50:07+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  9:50AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Storn!<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
