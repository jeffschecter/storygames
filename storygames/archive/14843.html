You tell stories with pictures and a pencil, critique your scenes, throw cards down on the table and manipulate your friends. I'm ready to put it into production, but I haven't got the money to do it right. Or the editors. Now, I don't mean editors like Andrew Kennrick (of White Dwarf), who I do have. I mean editors as in audience, the people who look at the product and get me to paint it a new colour. Or people who edit me, as in me, SebastianHickey, the person, because whenever I type anything anywhere I fail. Like now, I bet I'm failing to say what I wanted to say.<br/><br/>I'll try again.

You need something to sell, you need a way to sell people on it and a way to fill those orders. Source production, get quotes and get creative with your pledge levels.<br/><br/>It sounds like your asking someone to do some of this for you. That's cool, this is work traditionally done by a publisher. kick starter is an interesting space for creators and publishers, while a savvy creator can use it to self publish, the act of publishing is still quite a bit of work.<br/><br/>Business is intimidating but if you sit still and focus it is all about moving things from point A to point B and math. You can do it!

Briefly (the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yes</span>), it is a card game with a four page rules spread. The cards have been sent off for the second proof and, barring some content that I'd like to create with the help of pledgers, it's all done. Briefly (the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span>), the four page rules spread is currently five pages, and needs some editing help from Andrew (who will be doing it next week with me).\n<blockquote>-- Does it have an audience yet? (i.e. a bunch of people who've played it, like it, and want to support it)</blockquote> Those who played it with me, or near me, want to support it. Otherwise, no. A resounding no. I'd say there are around 30 people I know by face and name who would be happy to see the game get onto a gaming shelf.\n<blockquote>Generally speaking, it seems like the Kickstarters that are most successful have both of these taken care of before they start collecting money from people (see: Do). Or, at least, are pretty short, small, and cheap to produce, so it's not much work to pull them together afterward and not much $ commitment from people to support them (see: Be Ashamed Young Prince).</blockquote> I must go for the latter. The game rules are already brief, so that's handy, plus all the art is done and dusted. Another tick. The problem here is that my vision extended to significant support, in two formats: an expanded PDF delivery of the rules (more content creation) and an ongoing web platform for support and play artefacts. Perhpas this is something I should look to curb, to keep the goalpoasts wide.\n<blockquote>Since it's coming out of Game Chef last year, I'd definitely be interested in helping with Chronicles of Skin, but it's definitely important to have a plan for what you want to accomplish and know that you have things in place to be successful. </blockquote> Thanks Jonanthan. I'd really appreciate your help, just as you have given it here. I need frank, honest questions to help me gauge my decisions and set reasonable goals of expectation. If, in this discussion, we highlight areas of weakness in my skills or strategies, perhaps we can figure out a way to solve them together?<br/><br/>To elaborate on the mission, I'd like to raise $2000, which is enough to fund the minimum viable print run for the deck of custom cards and to pay for art and other staff, and international shipping. I intend to invest a modest hunk of that myself. It will be a 30 day project, with a pile of pledge rewards (which I need help pruning), initiated with a video, blurb and bespoke graphics on IndieGoGo. It will be supported on the social media by a colleague of mine, because I am incapable of using that networking platform. Totally incapable.\n<blockquote>Who's your target audience?

Thank you too for these questions. I'm really a terrible business planner, but I have conceived of a semi-intangible target audience. I'm selling to family gamers and craft hobbyists.</blockquote>\nActually, that description (family gamers and craft hobbyists) is just a description of me. I hadn't realised at all until I wrote it down. I mulled that over for two days, and looked at where the game has succeeded and where it has failed. This allowed me to conceive a new target audience, as you'll see if you read to the end of the post.<br/><br/>When I wrote the game for Game Chef, I intended a game of storytelling, much lighter and liberal than anything I'd done before. The first playtest was a disaster, of course. We played at home with a bunch of close friends, and, although the emblem and trait creation worked nicely, the gameplay suffered. Sorry, I'm getting away from the point. After that, nearly all of the playtests happened in public places, not at home. Conventions, monthly meets, weekly meets, always at a point when no-one knew for sure what would be happening that evening.<br/><br/>The only time it didn't work (didn't function) was when, after introducing the game's theme to a stranger, I decided not to run the game for him (or us). He was noticeably dubious and actively concerned about the game's playability. "It'll either play okay or it'll completely fail." This is what he told me after a 60 second intro. It could have been my spiel, but I think, since it caught the interest of others at the table, it was probably more to do with his own tastes. After getting to know him better, I started to understand that he was new to story gaming. Like me, he had gotten into it through Spirit of the Century, so I understood his reservations. Chronicles of Skin looks like a "hippy game."<br/><br/>After thinking about people like this man, I came to understand that doodling and thematic storytelling are things that convention going gamers are more likely to want to do at conventions. The weirdest, off the wall, riskiest games of my life have all been played at conventions. It's the time of my gaming life when I'll have an excess of choice, so one bad game out of X isn't too much of a loss.<br/><br/>Basically, at conventions, some people take risks with new games. Those people are my target audience.\n<blockquote>Are you hitting them? Do they know about your game, and do they want it?</blockquote>\nChronicles of Skin fits in your pocket, has four pages of rules and plays in under 3 hours. I think I'm hitting that convention-game-gap moment. You could buy it, read and play it between slots. Do convention gamers know about the game? No. Except for you guys. Do they want it? I think so. Once they hear about it. But we all say that, or think that. don't we? So how do I find out if they want it?

What do you think? <blockquote>because what you describe here is a shoo-in for the "impulse buy" category.</blockquote> Though I want the game to have more attraction than a last-minute-purchase, I think this is the key selling point. Jason, the artist for the game, has always envisioned it to have a till-side POS. Thanks for the direction.\n<blockquote>I am not sure whether Kickstarter is going to be helpful for you</blockquote> Unfortunately, I need support. Even a tiny, little bit will help. Without support, the game won't get made. Though the game is finished and I could get 50 copies made tomorrow for a reasonable price, in order to ship the game in the right price bracket, I have to print a lot more than 50 decks.<br/><br/>I'm optimistic. Creating art as they tell stories is one of the core things you do as a kid.

I need help with the Kickstarter strategy. Id' like someone to look at my proposals for the rewards, and tell me if they are exciting or dull, or strategically useless. Unlike all my heroes, I am very bad at presenting myself online. I would like to get better, but I think I'm web-autistic. So I need someone to teach me to talk, or to talk for me.  I'd also like help thinking about spreading the word. This community is the only place I have to talk about my projects. I'm shy about it, too. I need help being less shy and I need ideas and direction for presenting myself in other arenas. I'd like prospective pledgers to understand how much love has been put into the game, and what they can do to help, and how they will be rewarded. I think that's the key culture of the Kickstarter thing. A friend of mine successfully funded an album using FundIt. She had such an honest, open and friendly pitch. I'd like help figuring out to show people my friendliness.<br/><br/>There is nothing I want more for the game than to get it on the shelves in time for Christmas. The art looks really shiny, and I expect the box will be the same (Jay's still working on it). I'm imagining it in a little, retail mutli-pack by the cash register. Imagine that! Then someone could buy it or get it in their sock. From Santa!

The rest of us were super-excited for it - and I at least - still am and looking forward to seeing what comes of the kickstarter.<br/><br/>As Shreyas says, having the game be something that can fit in your pocket is a major selling point and something I actively look for in games.

It's worth taking an hour and just browsing through stuff thats interesting to you, and seeing if you can find inspiration or a certain style to use as a template for your pitch.<br/><br/>For what its worth, the place you're at (game is pretty much together, there's solid plans for making it real, you literally just need money to make it happen in the way you're envisioning it) is a really appropriate position to be in for Kickstarter.<br/><br/>One big question tho - Kickstarter uses Amazon payments, which requires you to have a US bank account.

After following links for a couple of projects to kickstarter, I now pretty much just browse kickstarter on a regular basis looking for cool stuff...sometimes stuff that I really really want, sometimes just stuff that deserves to exist even if I would never buy it off a store shelf myself (or attend the performance, or whatever the project is).  I think I've now backed something like 20 projects...maybe 3 or 4 of those came from links in other places.  The rest came from "let's see what kick ass dreams need some help today".<br/><br/>So for me the key thing is passion.  Kickstarter is a sales pitch.  Its a sales pitch that you have all the time in the world to craft so a less than compelling pitch is even more of a turn off than it would be face to face where (I at least) am more inclined to be forgiving of stumbled presentations from people who aren't naturally sales people.  Its a lot harder for me to be forgiving of a stumbled presentation on kickstarter...because geez...find someone to help you make it awesome before you put it up.<br/><br/>That doesn't always mean awesome videos with lofty production values...not every kickstarter video needs to be Technoir.  But I should be able to tell that you personally are super excited by the project, and want to share that excitment with me and I should be able to tell why you're excited and what makes it exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337761/#Comment_337761" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T07:07:56+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  7:07AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2011 7:19AM by Sebastian.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I'm going to answer your questions.

It might happen at house cons, local cons, local group events, game night as comic shops, or the off week in the summer when the GM is on vacation and a pick-up game is needed. Maybe "pick-up game" will broaden your audience a bit and still remain true to your concept?<br/><br/>Also, I think people don't mind printing cards if its easy to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337843/#Comment_337843" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T12:35:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2011 12:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2011 12:43PM by Sebastian.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right Kira, it is not just for conventions, and, like you said, it is very suitable for unplanned occasions. Yes, "pick-up" is better. Also, Kira, re: the card printing, I think I could offer a subset of the cards that allows players to invent the cultures. Maybe just one double sided-sheet, which I could couple with the associated or complete game rules.\n<blockquote>If you're interested in a list of places it would be appropriate to post an announcement about the fundraiser, I bet we could make one of those for ya as well. Past that, honestly and enthusiastically posting in your "home" environment (whether thats story games, twitter, your blog, whatever) will almost always yield more eyeballs than, y'know, not doing that.</blockquote> I'd love a list please. But I'd also like some help understanding the term "posting." I'm sure you don't mean spamming, and I'm clueless about an alternative. This is one of the key dilemmas I have about self-promotion. I don't want to advertise, but I want share information. How do I do that without coming off all desperate and annoying?\n<blockquote>Have you looked through Kickstarter at successfully funded projects? It's worth taking an hour and just browsing through stuff thats interesting to you, and seeing if you can find inspiration or a certain style to use as a template for your pitch.</blockquote> Okay. That's a great idea.\n<blockquote>Check out IndieGoGo, I know Graham had success with that and it's nation-agnostic, as far as I know. </blockquote>Yes, that looks like the best alternative. I'd been trying to find a solution for a while. I'll change the title of this thread accordingly.\n<blockquote>Rad. Ok, what are you thinking? Lets workshop it! I have lots of opinions about how reward levels should work!</blockquote> Should we do that here?\n<blockquote>That doesn't always mean awesome videos with lofty production values...not every kickstarter video needs to be Technoir. But I should be able to tell that you personally are super excited by the project, and want to share that excitment with me and I should be able to tell why you're excited and what makes it exciting. </blockquote> That's really useful Ralph. There is something essential in the way you put it: convey excitement, share the excitement and show the roots. This is really helpful because it gives me a kind of map of the fund-raiser pitch. I think it works, you see, in the order you've described, which will be really useful during editing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338031/#Comment_338031" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T10:30:48+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 10:30AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just attended an excellent card game design workshop at GenCon and might be able to give suggestions to lower your costs.
