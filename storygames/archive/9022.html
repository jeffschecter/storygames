Dream Palace is a structured freeform storytelling game that makes use of the structure of the Movies. Its just gone through its first complete playtesting session with Ralph Mazza and the Ben-Ezra family, and some parts of it worked and some didn't. Those of you that are interested in checking out the version we playtested can go to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://heraldicgame.com/index.php?module=Pagesetter&amp;tid=2&amp;filter=category^sub^2&amp;cv=2" rel="nofollow">http://heraldicgame.com/index.php?module=Pagesetter&amp;tid;=2&amp;filter;=category^sub^2&amp;cv;=2</a> to download the files.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that didnt' work was Foreshadows. The idea was that the players were supposed to be able to establishi something early in the story that would pay off big later. An example of thi would be the Trope, Chekovs' Gun, which basically says that is there is a gun seen hanging on the wall of the beginning ofr the story, will be first before the end of the story. Movies use foreshadowing heavily in order to make the story more plausible for the audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any words of wisdom of help to fix, replace, or to simply get rid of foreshadows, the doors to my mind are thrown wide open!.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199490/#Comment_199490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T11:27:35+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 11:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2009 11:27AM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, Keith!<br><br>On reading the rules doc, my first thought is that you may have been defining the foreshadow scenes too narrowly.  That is, you throw down a card and narrate a foreshadow scene and write down one thing that you want to become important later \u2014 Gun on Mantelpiece or whatever.  You might get a lot more bang out of foreshadow scenes if you wrote down more than one thing from the foreshadow scene \u2014 Gun on Mantelpiece, Heated Argument, and Implied Mafia Connections.  That way, there are three targets that might turn out to be useful later, rather than just one.  In retrospect at the "end of the movie," the players could say that foreshadow scene was "about" whichever thing got reincorporated, but between foreshadow and callback, what that foreshadow scene was about is up in the air.<br><br>Another thought I had was that you could make Callback to Foreshadow more powerful \u2014 maybe it lets you play two cards at once, adding their value together?  I'm not sure how you'd make that work, but it's another option.<br/><br/>-- Josh                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199500/#Comment_199500" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T12:23:50+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 12:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2009 12:33PM by Keith Sears.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Josh. Some very interesting ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now that I have had some sleep and a chance to think things over, I think one of the major reasons Foreshadows didnt' work is because the playtest group didn't want to play them as originally written. Originally, Foreshadows were something that would be added to the character record and could be used by the player that had that character. Foreshadows that were created by the audience Talking in the Theater stayed with that particular player.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original concept was never tested. The playtest group opted to make Foreshadows a communal resource with a master list of them in front of the Producer. However, with this arrangement, it made it difficult for the players to keep track of the Foreshadows, and severely reduced any sense of ownership of that resource. So they were very rarely used. This runs counter to movie conventions, where they seem to be much more powerful than any abilities the character may possess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've learned that little things like that can make a big difference in a game. I ghod example would be when we playtested Sons of Liberty. My experience with it turned out to be miserable. Seth had been anticipating an "Awesome" experience with the game that he had previously at a demo, and was severely disappointed Why was this?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a small detail that had been left out of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game had been presented to the group as a "real-time" game. We were slapping down cards and shouting over each other as fast as we could. That wasn't the right way to do it. If you wanted to speak, you were supposed to hold a card out in front of you and then the other players were supposed to lay your card down and say your piece. I'm certain that it was left out becasue the designer considered it to be only common courtesy. However, it proved to be a very important part of the game..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199505/#Comment_199505" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T12:36:27+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 12:36PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yes, the judo of game design.

I think I need to tighten up the Plot Poitns. They are the spine of the entire game. The current version didn't fall apart, but it didn't quite do what I wanted it to, either. Things shuold get a big tense/excting in the second half of the game. However, the playtest was a comedy, so I might have a false result because of the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
