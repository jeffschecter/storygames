"Harn" was just this big island, but I think it's now a marketing brand for Columbia games than means anything in the Harniverse.<br/><br/>All of the Harn publication are set on the same date so they don't push a bunch of meta-fiction on you. The whole world is pseudo-medieval. Lots of cultural niches to pick from, but the majority of the published works are very European in flavor.<br/><br/>There's an interesting (to read, I've never played it) rules system, HarnMaster. <br/><br/>It sounds like you have already encountered the abundant online materials about Harn. To me, it's a sim-heavy paradise.<br/><br/>Also, there's a weird situation with the creator of Harn and the current publisher. The creator says only he is allowed to publish this stuff by contract, but the publisher keeps publishing. That's all I know. <br/><br/>There's one person at MACE (a regional con here in NC) who runs HarnMaster every year, in full costume and a weapons rack. Harn brings out the committed gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139401/#Comment_139401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T11:31:38+00:00" title="April 12, 2008 11:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            H\xe2rn is pseudo-medieval and consistent setting, or at least succeeds in giving out a very consistendt and thought-out feeling of itself. It tends to draw in a lot of people already intrested in history and has small, but quite dedicated following. The main setting book touches on things like Oceanic currents and language families of the whole planet, alongside with medieval culture stuff, history of the isle of H\xe2rn and so forth. It's accompanied by an index that has an entrace for every town, castle, keep, culture, monster, large geographical feature of H\xe2rn, and so on. I'd also call it Simulation-paradise.<br/><br/>H\xe2rnMaster, the rules system (which comes in two flavours), is a percent-based system - I'd guess it's very traditional, with a lot of attributes and skills based on it. If you randomly roll a character, there's a good change of ending up being a peasant, and most of the results are something not commonly thought to be player-character professions, again simulating the "real" medieval professions. The rules system is quite detailed (smooth, but heavy with book keeping) and for example keeps track of wounds that characters get. Getting an infection to a wound received in battle is a popular way of dying. <br/><br/>The two flavours of systems comes from the mentioned rift between the original creator and the publisher, who both now publish their own versions of H\xe2rnMaster, and lately of the setting material as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139456/#Comment_139456" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T21:37:27+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  9:37PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2008 9:50PM by Adam_Dray.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at the <a href="http://www.kelestia.com/?q=faq" rel="nofollow">FAQ list</a> on Kelestia.com, the official H\xe2rn site, for a quick understanding of what the setting and rules are all about.

It has always seemed to me that Harn is basically a reaction to the sloppy way in which "fantasy" handles the "medieval." It seems that people got the notion that D&amp;D and the like was supposed to be a realistic portrayal of a medieval world. Or that, somehow, realism is a goal of all play, since it supports immersion or something of the sort. Such that any time one can look at a convention of play, and see that it is a convention, this is a bad thing. So, yes, it's simulationist in that it makes every attempt to do things "correctly." <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as he mentioned, the next step is to make it complete. I think that they chose an island, because it gave them a finite amount of land to fill in. And they have, in fact, filled it in, in great detail. I don't know if the impression is true, but one gets the feeling from the materials that there's nowhere one can go in Harn, and not, for instance, know what people he will run into. Not just population figures, but usually some amount of detail on them. At the very least how many are farmers, vs other occupations, and that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nNothing is left to the imagination where a "correct" version of it can be supplied before hand. It attempts to be as "complete" as a CRPG, but at the same time more "realistically complete." <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the motive to do this. Playing in Harn, and adhering to the idea that if it's printed it cannot be countermanded, means that there's a very "extant" world there, one that feels strongly like it has it's own actual existence. We do X, Y happens, because Z is there, and this is unambiguous. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, whether or not this is practical, or whether it actually leads to fun play, is something I can't comment on. I'm sure the fans of the world love it precisely because of this attention to detail. The Beeg Horseshoe response is that they've simply been burned by players doing implausible things, and/or hiding their own agendas in play behind character actions (which are always deemed implausible, whether they are so or not), and they're reacting by creating a world where as little can be manipulated by the players and even GM as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nI won't judge. But I will say that, while I appreciate detail, I think that the detail of Harn is less useful for actual play than it is for imagined play. That is you read it and think, gee, that's cool how real this is, play in it would sure feel real. Or, at least that's how it works out for me. I spent a lot of time and effort making up worlds, and even more worrying about the fact that I had not put in enough effort to make them complete and realistically detailed, only to have my play fail for entirely different reasons (ones I couldn't identify at the time). <br/>\n<br/>\nI do applaud the feature mentioned above, that the details mentioned are a freeze-frame of the world at a single point in time. Meaning it's not described as steady-state, but realistically in motion. You simply have to extrapolate from that beginning point any changes that might occur over time. Practically you probably just ignore any changes, putting the state in the book as the state when you hit those elements in play. But the point is that it does give you the impression that the descriptions aren't of things as they've always been and always will be. Nor of material meant to channel players into certain plots. It's just a world that sits there waiting to be pushed forward as you see fit. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's a definite benefit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Harn-Master, yeah, it's got the same agenda, and that means horrifically detailed rules for how padding under armor affects the impact of polearms against said armor. So you can realistically kill folks. Which isn't realistic itself, to be the center of play. In fact it's one of those, "If you fight, you might die" systems, meant to be so realistic that nobody wants to use the system...<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm....<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139780/#Comment_139780" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:44:50+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally thought you wanted to know about ham.

It lets us skip over questions like what the city demographics or layout is like, since those are known and understood.  I can see it being frustrating if you really want to engage in world-building -- i.e. you really wanted to be able to detail landscapes, demographics and so forth.  However, I'm more interested in personal aspects of play.  I'd prefer to engage in what my character Judyn's house is like, rather than what the city is like, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
