The last episode included some combat, and though that went fine as well, it could have gone better!<br/><br/>I'd like to run Lady Blackbird next, but this (really neat) game has a lot of swashbuckling, reckless flying, chasing, escaping, combatting and other scenes that are way more action oriented than I know how to narrate! Of course I'll definitely allow my players to help me out in this department, but I do want to do my part in setting the scene.<br/><br/>Do you guys have any tips on how to narrate some ass-kickingly awesome action scenes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421478/#Comment_421478" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T16:30:16+00:00" title="September 13, 2013  4:30PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run some good action scenes, and I think of everything like a movie.

Cinematic logic takes precedence over everything: bad guys catch up when it makes sense, our attention is drawn strictly to the action in every situation. Skip over boring stuff: cut to the dramatic moments of exchanges, like when there's a chase we see them on the roof, then in the stairwell, then crossing the street, but we don't follow them through each and every hallway. Just the moments with interesting obstacles. It's like you're doing the filming and editing at the same time. That's how I think of it, at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421480/#Comment_421480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T20:33:23+00:00" title="September 13, 2013  8:33PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just been reading Robert E Howard's Steve Costigan stories - the boxing sailor.

What you need to do is to think swashbuckling, and things will sort itself out. I've been playing descriptive-heavy combats for six years now and I got two mantras that I use all the time during battles.<br/><br/><b>If they can do it in an easy way, then they can do it in a hard way</b><br/>If they can throw a grenade to take out some mooks, then they can leap on the wall and fight them for a minute, or tear the roof down over their heads. Don't give modification based on what they do, but by what they wish to accomplish. Personally, I think the difficulties in Lady Blackbird is set to high.<br/><br/><b>They are action heroes!</b><br/>This follows the previous mantra. Would an action hero on the movie screen get away with this? Then the characters will get away with it too. Namedrop a few movies before you start to play - even before they get their characters - so they can use them as inspiration. Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars and The Sea Hawk are some suggestions on swashbuckling. Sometimes I even go so far that I let the players write a name of a movie on their character sheet. Someone who writes Rob Roy will let the character fight differently compared to someone that wrote Rambo or Hero (examples for a more generic action game).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I know that you should ask questions all the time, but you can also increase the effort for the players, by making them involve things in their descriptions. This already exist in the game due to the use of traits and keys, and you should <i>never ever</i> allow more than three of these things together. Never ... ever! What you could do is to put them in dangerous situations. You already got this kind of thinking when you write "reckless flying, chasing, escaping," but you can extend this. I always throw the characters out of something. Now it's their turn to describe their way out of it. Flood things, make things crash, make them loose control over mechanics, put them in a situation where they are about to be executed. Last time we played, I was going to be forced into marriage (again - I played Lady Blackbird), and the others saved me. The body guard teleported me away from the altar and then swung away with a wire connected to The Owl. No roll, only one short description.<br/><br/>To come up with situations like this, I use two mantras. "Why do they fail?" and "Think big". It's not one goblin. It's a whole colony! The characters don't travel safely to one port, because an octopus will make them fail. No, "think big". A whole army of squids are chasing them Matrix style! "Why do they fail?" can be used anywhere. Ask yourself this question when they fail a roll in combat, so you can create more elements that they have to take into consideration when describing their next action. This creates a back and forth flow between you and your players.<br/><br/>Ask yourself this question when you want something to happen. It can be as trivial as reading a book or epic like ... well, using the sun as an energy source. The latter could sound quite impossible, but remember: "they are action heroes!".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421483/#Comment_421483" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T22:12:21+00:00" title="September 13, 2013 10:12PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2013 10:13PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wound up in a discussion like this at another forum, heh.

That's because they're static tagalongs, and they don't create anything terribly new in their own right. Cool actions are about CHARACTERS doing THINGS to OTHER THINGS.<br/><br/><b>The environment is dynamic.</b> Encourage players to incorporate the terrain and environment into their description, and have it change through their actions and the enemies' actions! Kick over barrels, slash rigging, tilt the deck! Keep reincorporating these elements and letting them evolve as the scene progresses!<br/><br/><b>Keep it punchy.</b> You want to leave your players with vibrant but short images. A bunch of quick shots that stick in their minds are better than one elaborate "long shot" that they'll potentially get lost in. And remember--it's not a book or even a movie. It's a game, and a game has its own pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zephyr" title="zephyr"><img alt="zephyr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zephyr">zephyr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421488/#Comment_421488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T02:57:08+00:00" title="September 14, 2013  2:57AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, great tips!<br/><br/><b>Scrape</b>: Cuts within action scenes to get to the good bits sounds great, as does drawing from the cinema scenes and tricks we all know and love!

Don't do that. Seriously, don't. Don't say he swings and misses: say that his opponent manages to block the attack.

What would you say is special about the pace of a game?</blockquote>\nIn terms of the pacing of a game--it has to be a lot quicker and snappier. That's for a couple reasons, in my mind. <br/><br/>First, because you're sharing table space and spotlight time with a number of other players. If spotlight time is distributed fairly, then taking extra time on an action is multiplied by four or five. If spotlight is distributed unfairly, you're having fun at the expense of the others.<br/><br/>Second, because table energy is a precious commodity. Description and adjectives tend to drain energy, verbs tend to boost it, because there's more engagement with the environment.<br/><br/>And, when I think about it, books can afford to get into more description simply because your brain is able to absorb it better. When something is on a page, you can read each individual word, read the whole sentence, and unconsciously go back to review it all. When you're listening to something at the table, you get one shot at describing something, and everyone's attention is devoted to making sure they understand exactly what you're doing in the fiction. Details detract from that, because that's more for the brain to parse through.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's not an absolute, and you shouldn't have Spartan action descriptions, but it's good to keep everything focused on what the active consequences of your move are.<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?702204-Preferred-degree-of-description-your-face-to-face-role-playing-sessions" rel="nofollow">Link to the latest, best thread where I saw this discussed.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421498/#Comment_421498" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T11:24:02+00:00" title="September 14, 2013 11:24AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One bit of advice I keep close to my heart is:<br/><br/><b>You don't suck, he's just that good...or maybe just lucky.</b> It's inevitable that a player is going to fail a roll during an action scene, and there's a strong tendency to narrate that as a PC blunder of some kind.

Add descriptive flair to every manuever or event, so that even if mechanically your npc is "just attacking" again, last time she was "leaping behind the desk and popping off a round" and this time she "barrell rolls from the desk to the chair, firing wildly." The troll swings his club overhand at the paladin, but next time it will step back and jab like a lance, then go low for the feet with a wild swing... just mix up descriptions for everything, no matter if the rules engage those particular manuevers differently or not.

Oh, lets cut to someone else", its hard to do the same maneuver again. Frankly, the GM can do this with any kind of roll to make things interesting. It's never interesting if nothing changes.<br/><br/>It's also the GM's duty to change the environment to keep things interesting (the players can help, of course). Over the years, I noticed that seven rolls are the maximum for a conflict if you want it descriptive. After that, the players start to focusing more on the mechanics ("I did five damage") than actually describing what the rolls did. I actually built into my own action game around that a combat can consist of at most five actions per player, and then the combat must come to a halt. Perhaps the ground is opening up or a ship is crashing down? Perhaps a third party is joining? Perhaps the opposition flees, or takes the characters captive? In my second game, I limited each conflict to five actions for the whole group.<br/><br/>I would like to continue on what <b>CarpeGuitarrem</b> wrote about pacing. Why I wrote that you shouldn't allow involving more than three traits and keys is partly because of pacing. The maximum of elements that the player can involve in their descriptions are three, and three is the absolute most. Why? Because after that number, the players start listing things, and those descriptions are never fun to listen to. "Hmmm, the door is locked? Okay I'm going to try and open it, I get bonus dice because (checks list) I'm <i>strong</i>, and I'm <i>clever</i> enough to do it <i>silently</i>. And I wink at my friends, so I get another die because I'm doing it <i>charmingly</i>." (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/421141#Comment_421141" rel="nofollow">source</a>)<br/><br/>This is also why you should lower the difficulty for the rolls, otherwise the players can feel that they want to include ALL the aspects and keys <i>every</i> time. That leads to repetitive and long descriptions, which kills the flow and any kind of action feeling that you guys built up so far. (I understand the thing with high difficulties, and that's so the players will spend their free dice and therefore have reasons to play out slower character-driven scenes later on. I feel that, even if the idea is good, it's a bad implementation.)<br/><br/><b>Summary</b><br/>1. Break up action filled sequences after five rolls.<br/>2.

Just as how talking scenes tend to build description upon description, where you'll say something specifically to push the character to say things that highlight aspects of their character, action sequences go the same way, only with action instead of dialogue.  You'll build off of each other's descriptions, and that will give the action sequence a form.<br/><br/>The main reason I mention this is that, in the role of GM, you'll have to describe much more action than the players will, so it can be easy to run out of ideas.  I sometimes find it helpful to have a list of basic types of actions I can riff off of, for those sessions where I'm a bit brain-dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421661/#Comment_421661" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T05:08:37+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  5:08AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been reading three different books of lat with fighting scenes in them. The Mysterious Fu Manchu 1913 (intrepid British investigators tracking down the inscrutable yellow menace), Steve Costagan short stories 1930 (a rather dumb sailor boxer in the Orient), and The Bears of Blue River 1908 (about bear hunting in 1820's Indiana). The one thing in common between the three very different actions is that while they give physical details "a savage right hook to the jaw" they keep fights short. There are not too many blows before the fight is resolved or complicated somehow. This isn't a rule but it makes sense. I remember reading a Edgar Rice Boroughs Mars novel once and becoming very bored with the repetitiveness of the fights. He used the same words too often and didn't give enough background for me to care for the outcome of the action. <br/><br/>I wonder if that makes sense to incorporate into a story game combat system, where for my money combat should not be the centerpiece of the story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421662/#Comment_421662" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T05:44:07+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  5:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you do the same thing twice (perhaps it's a signature move), it is because you're setting up for a twist (comedic, reversal of fortune, etc.)<br/><br/>Steal liberally from John Woo movies.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421670/#Comment_421670" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T11:04:46+00:00" title="September 19, 2013 11:04AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can have great, short fights.

It's been touched upon before, but I'd like to expand on it. I guess I use <a href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.dk/2010/09/flow-er-model-step-1-3.html" rel="nofollow">this/2010/09/flow-er-model-step-1-3.html</a> definition of 'energy', but it doesn't matter too much. During an action scene you can track energy by how impatient and ecstatic people are, how loud they're talking, how big their body language is. Anything that makes the energy drop is bad, obviously. To a certain degree, you can create energy simply by showing it yourself; If you're ecstatic, you're players will become ecstatic. So stand up, don't whisper, make sweeping body language movements to supplement the cool things you're describing. More energy is created through feedback, through sending back what you receive. It grows the more it bounces back and forth. For this reason, I'm a big of systems that allow the GM and player (or player and player for PvP) to "duel on words", trade cool descriptions in rapid succession.  It drops whenever there's significant time lag. When there's an awkward pause not filled with action chops. Dice and other such mechanics doesn't have to be damage the energy if they're quick and tense, like when there's a lot riding on every roll, but they quite easily can. If there's a lot of fiddling with mechanics and special powers, lots of interpreting of the dice, that can destroy the energy, and you have to start from scratch.<br/><br/>That's not to say you have to have full steam all the time. Personally I love flashbacks, courtesy of 3:16, as a mechanic for interjecting some calm and characterization into a long battle. A flashback to where a character learned their ultimate technique (think Kill Bill 2) also has a natural platform to jump right back into the action again! So yeah, take breaks, whether it's for in-game socializing or real life air, but as long as you have fuel, keep up that energy!<br/><br/>Also super important: Be a fan of the player (not of the player <i>character</i> as in AW, though that's not bad either). This means encouraging them and believing in them to do something cool. Some people have difficulty coming up with cool action stunts under the implicit time pressure roleplaying has and the energy requires, but encourage them even still. Nod and smile at them, compliment them them for trying, even when they don't quite hit the mark. And when they do, dammit say so, don't just think it! Again, feedback, they give you energy and you give it back again.<br/><br/>I think the more specific advice about inspiration for the actions chops have mostly been covered; Steal cools scenes and moves from movies and games, incorporate terrain, have something burning, in free fall or about to explode, provide alternative, but still action-y objectives rather than only "kill that dude", oh, and improvised weapons are always fun.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421678/#Comment_421678" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T13:05:45+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  1:05PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  For this reason, I'm a big of systems that allow the GM and player (or player and player for PvP) to "duel on words", trade cool descriptions in rapid succession.

For me, that means that the fight has to mean something. Even in Lady Blackbird, swashbuckling without purpose is a waste. Avoid "Random Encounters." When the characters get into a fight, make it about something important to them. A fight in a bar on Nightport? Great - if failure means the Imperial troops get them, or the parts-dealer gets killed. But just a bar fight? Meh. Players get into combat when something big is on the line.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421698/#Comment_421698" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T09:45:44+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  9:45AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some great stuff in this thread.

All the advice on this thread takes precedence over pauses for checking rulebooks. Don't take more that three minutes to double-check all the bonuses you're adding to the dice roll. Keep on the table one of those clocks used to play chess or a hourglass if you must. And it's not like you've got to keep eye-contact with the players on a staring contest, but each time you let your eyes wander elsewhere for too long, it's a cue for players to focus on something else. And even if whatever is distracting you is another aspect of the game, that takes a toll on the flow of the game, slowing down all the action you've been building.<br/><br/>Of course, you can also play battles at a bit slower pace and still have fun going full powergaming tactical with miniatures, it may still feel like an action scene, but that's a completely different atmosphere to the one I'm thinking of here. In my group we enjoy the tactical miniature battles too, but personally I've had much more fun by far whenever we used them only for reference, hand-waved most of the specific rules and went for a broader interpretation of the general ones and went full cinematic on almost non-stop action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421815/#Comment_421815" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T12:28:08+00:00" title="September 23, 2013 12:28PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2013 6:12AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Don't take more that three minutes to double-check all the bonuses you're adding to the dice roll.</blockquote>\nWoawsa! Three minutes? I would say 5-10 seconds. This is what I like with games like <b>Lady Blackbird</b> and <b>InSpectres</b>. The game master has no rules to take care of, which means that the person can answer back instantly on the players' actions. (When I played <b>Feng Shui</b>, I had all the rolls and calculations premade - sometimes on a list and rolling 1d20 - so I didn't have to spend time on that.)<br/><br/>As with the players, I normally let them roll all the dice on beforehand. This demands the players to know the difficulty. And what happens if they cheat? So what? We're in this together. It's about the descriptions (for the style of action I  play), not about counting numbers on plastic cubes (which can be fun in more tactical games). This is something I do with my regular group. A group on a convention would think this to be too weird, so I take it more slow there. After a while I can let go and let them roll on beforehand, if I feel they got the hang of how to play the game. Of what the important parts are in the sensation of playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421817/#Comment_421817" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T13:34:07+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  1:34PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, you're right Rickard, now that I think of it, 10 seconds is actually long enough.
