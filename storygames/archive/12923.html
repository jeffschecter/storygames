Up to that point I'd played a handful of RPGs - Toon, Bughunters, Marvel Superheroes - but the big troll with a machine gun on the cover kind of made my brain pop.

I bought the Player's Handbook from a friend of mine for 10 dollars and the first time I tried to read through it (age 9) I was like "Wow, this is complicated", but I still knew this roleplaying thing was for me. I ended up having a disproportionate exposure to the little monstrous compendiums, as those were the only D&amp;D things cheap enough to convince my parents to buy for me/I could save up for on a regular basis (until one day I conned my older friend into loaning me the money to buy Planescape). Since that was all I had, I *really* got into reading the little monster descriptions and imagining situations involving these fantastic creatures. I skipped those annoying stat blocks and skimmed "how this monster fights" and read the juicy ecology and behavior sections. This is why the 4E Monstrous Manual makes me sad.<br/><br/>Oh, and I also loved the experience of looking at the campaign setting supplements listed on the inside of the covers and trying to extrapolate what the hell could be going on there so that we could play adventures without buying all that expensive stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291047/#Comment_291047" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T06:32:46+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  6:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, despite a crush on AD&amp;D 1E, sort of like a kid's crush on a teacher, my first love really was Marvel Super Heroes RPG, the basic one in the yellow box.

Then the third edition came out, and I fully fell in love. My, oh my. They pretty much had solved every single one of the problems I was so bitterly complaining about.<br/><br/>When the 3.5 came out, I felt betrayed. What could they possibly do to improve my beloved? Well, I gave it a chance. And it did pay out. It was more of a make-over. Still the same sweet lover, only better fit and sexier.<br/><br/>Then I played the heck out of my D&amp;D. (By that time, out group got to play weekly for almost three years in a row.) And by the end of it I felt heartbroken. There were some places the game was failing me, and I was growing more and more unsatisfied with it. Was that all there was into it?<br/><br/>Finally, I discovered the Indie thing, and my eyes started shining again. I tried to use some new tricks and moves to rekindle our dwindling love, but then it finally came to me. System matters. The rules would not support the kind of game I was looking for, and the group's social contract was too stale and full of bad habits and passivity. And so our love was over...<br/><br/><br/>Some months ago I got to play a couple of sessions again. I was curious about the experience, now that I had been into all this hippie stuff for almost 3 years.<br/><br/>And it was kind of sad, actually. The nostalgia was big, but it was exactly as going with an ex for a nice coffee to catch up on each other, and find out how apart your lives have drifted.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291121/#Comment_291121" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T08:41:47+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  8:41AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2010 8:44AM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel, without a doubt.

When I was little I looked through my older brother's 1st ed AD&amp;D books ALL the the time.  I tried to run it (and did a poor job) and I played 2nd ed some (at least I THINK it was 2nd ed, those days are hazy) when a friend ran it.<br/>I also loved looking through my brother's <i>Dark Conspiracy</i>, <i>Twilight 2000</i>, and <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> books and even played/ran a bit of them.  I also owned and enjoyed playing/running <i>Toon</i>.<br/>It wasn't until high school that I picked up <i>Werewolf</i> and that was because, in the excitement of the <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> and the CCG boom, I'd started playing <i>Rage</i>, the CCG based on <i>Werewolf</i>.  Maybe it was just that the unabashed, over-the-top violence of it appealed to my 14 year-old nature, I don't know, but I thought it was great (and I still do) and when I realized it was based on an RPG, well of course I HAD to get that.<br/><br/>I never really did much with it.  Tried to run it a few times, but it never panned out.  So maybe it's kind of stupid that I was in love with it.  But maybe not.  My first human love was, after all, a girl I never kissed or dated.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>My husband and I met writing Exalted fanfiction on the internet. That's right.

It would be easy to say that.  For a long time that and D&amp;D made up almost all of my role-playing experience. Even though I had a lot of fun with those games I rarely felt like I was emulating the R.E. Howard or Edgar Rice Burroughs fiction I adored.  Mostly just a goofy sort of Tolkein-esque vibe except where the heroes spent a lot of their time drowning and falling in the mines of Moria.  I loved these games but I was maybe too young to be <i>in</i> love with them, y'know?<br/><br/>So I think my answer has to be R.Talsorian's Cyberpunk. First the 2013 and then the 2020 version.  Gibson's fiction had blown me away and then this came along and it felt like me and my friends could be the hackers, street samurai &amp; razor girls.  We could tell stories that made us feel like Deckard or Roy Batty.  <br/><br/>I think it was the intersection of being old enough to want to tell stories that weren't straight heroics and experienced enough to be able to help tell them even where the system wasn't giving us everything we needed.  Going down in a hail of flechettes to a pack of Arasaka corp mercs while pretending to be someone like Bobby Quine was so much more satisfying than being mowed down by orcs while pretending to be someone like Conan.  My hacker's destiny was written the first time he caught that femme's eye while hunting down new 'ware in the Sprawl; my barbarian was supposed to have kicked those orcs butts and gone on to eventually become king, dammit.  <br/><br/>As long as I was dying in the rain.  At night.  In slow motion.  For all the wrong reasons.  While wearing my black leather pants.  As long as those things were true, I was in love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291161/#Comment_291161" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T10:05:20+00:00" title="September  2, 2010 10:05AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Werewolf the Apocalypse.

Late November 1977. I had just turned 21, and my mother had bought me whatever version of D&amp;D was current for my birthday, and I was really juiced by the *idea* of RPGs, but D&amp;D was not IT. Before I ever played D&amp;D, or any other RPG, I walked into my game store - I was a veteran wargamer, and had patronized this store for years - and saw this new RPG called Traveller. I had been weaned on SF, not fantasy. Back then, fantasy was nothing. My dad was a big fan of SF, and we had tons of it dating back to the forties around the house. I bought the little black box, read it, and fell in love.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike Brad, I eventually fell out of love. My group was never interested in Trav, they loved D&amp;D, and the few times we played it were grudging. I put it away and ground out 20 years of D&amp;D. Meanwhile I was constantly reading new games and trying - and failing - to interest my group in them. I fell for other games - Ringworld particularly. When I looked at Traveller, it just wasn't the same. The Traveller fandom got locked into a downward spiral of who could be the biggest Grognard. The system was nailed to the Third Imperium. Trav got to be like my first girlfriend, recalled with fondness, but from whom I had long since moved. I wrote my own SF and never looked back. I haven't played Trav since the early eighties.<br/>\n<br/>\n-clash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291172/#Comment_291172" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T10:51:31+00:00" title="September  2, 2010 10:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shadowrun 3e. That big, beautiful black book sucked me in the minute I saw my friends copy (bound together with duct tape).<br/><br/>I was 14 and had just started playing AD&amp;D 2e (soon to move to 3.x), but the Shadowrun setting captivated the hell out of me. I convinced my parents' to get me the book during the summer between Freshmen and Sophomore year of high school and read it cover-to-cover. I played so many one-shots and mini-campaigns--every time a friend would be brave enough to suggest running it, me and my buddy would be all over it. We even wrote a semi-decent space opera version, with basically no rule hacks except for a few that gave passengers in vehicles a bit more to do (navigation systems, comms, etc).<br/><br/>I wasn't that excited again until I met Orpheus at the end of high school. Again: read it cover to cover, played a dozen sessions (not all of the same campaign, sadly), and then sort of petered out in college.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard was my third love, and it brought me to Burning Wheel which sparked my whole interest in small press games.

(Maybe it's because I could afford them.)  Like - wow!  You can get the D&amp;D experience without all those pages of vague &amp; conflicting rules?  You only need 3, maybe 4, six-sided dice?  You can fit characters on index cards?  Oh, and if your GM sucks (that would be me) it's still a decent wargame?  I'm sure it broke after a few sessions but I only ever played one-shots, and TFT at "1st level" (32 pts) was more fun than D&amp;D at 1st level.  (Dude, you can have like 8-16 spells!)<br/><br/>I don't know why I didn't like GURPS. I was rabidly looking forward to it because of my TFT love, but somehow it lost that je ne sais quois.

At that time, my most extensive gaming experience was a messy game of Vampire (which was my abusive, on again, off again girlfriend for many, many years even after Shadowrun.) and some futzing around with D&amp;D-alikes; I designed because D&amp;D; was evil and I couldn't afford it even if it wasn't. I bought the SR2 corebook off the shelf without having ever played it, and followed it up with almost all of the core (ie non-adventure) supplements over the years. I've had relatively little actual satisfactory play with the game, but unlike others, that hasn't anything to do with the rules, but with the difficulty I've always had with getting a steady game of anything going for very long. I have had many, many hours of satisfactory lonely-fun character generation with both the 2nd and 3rd Ed. versions of the rules. Somewhere I've still got a stack of characters I made and never played, along with pages of backstory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291247/#Comment_291247" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T15:55:04+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  3:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Top Secret.<br><br>I mean I loved our weirdo sci-fi D&amp;D mashup game, the one where we "bought" ships out of the old Terran Trade Authority books and then struck out to delve/loot the Proximan dungeons, but TS was the first straight-up RPG I really played and played. <br/><br/>We had lots of time with Traveller as well but it was a bittersweet relationship.

I used to study this 1979-80 full color TSR catalog I got my hands on. It was only a few pages, but it had Metamorphosis Alpha, Boot Hill, Monster Manual (the first AD&amp;D hardback). And my first love, Top Secret.<br/><br/>I was a HUGE 007 fan at that age. And we were still 4-5 years away from the actual James Bond 007 RPG. So I listened to my Rush albums and read the little snippet about the Top Secret game over and over, imagining what it would be nice to actually PLAY in a spy movie.

Just off the top of my head, since then we've had very successful IP launches:<br/><br/>1995- Legend of the Five Rings<br/><br/>1996 - Deadlands<br/><br/>1999 -7th Sea<br/><br/>All of which spawned multiple games, novels, and more, making them far more successful as IP launches than Burning Wheel, by an order of magnitude.

Every now and then I look back and wonder if I could run a game that recaptured the sheer thrill of our early wacky superhero campaigns, then I remember that the current version rulebook is 800 pages, and you STILL can't make a PC without a computer, and realize I don't have the energy for it. It was beautiful, and we were deeply in love, but in the end it was just too damn high-maintenance.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291831/#Comment_291831" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T19:10:36+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  7:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first love was Shadowrun 2nd ed, but I was sleeping around behind SR2's back with Feng Shui.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>get the impression that potentially Burning Wheel is the next most successful new IP since Vampire?</blockquote>\nNot even remotely.<br/><br/>Vampire came out in 91.

The CCG is part of it.    By any reasonable metric an IP launch that features multiple games (CCG, RPG, miniatures), novels, etc. -- is successful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br/>1996 - Deadlands[/quote]<br/><br/>It died, and got rebooted in Savage Worlds, although SW is doing pretty well these days so that would be another one.</blockquote>\nAgain, Deadlands spawned 5 RPGs (original, Hell on Earth, Lost Colony, Savage Worlds and Deadlands Reloaded), 2 CCGS (Doomtown, Lost Colony CCG), 2 wargames (Great Rail Wars, Range Wars), 2 Board Games (Battle for Slaughter Gulch and FRAG: Deadlands), as well as novels.

Couldn't say about the other ones, but I'm taking everything you're saying with a grain of salt.</blockquote>\nDeadlands was Pinnacle's first RPG.   Their debut product was a small-press wargame rules set (no minis, just the rulebook) called Fields of Honor which came out two years earlier.   Deadlands was their first (wait for it) IP launch, which is what we're talking about, in response to your ridiculous and completely disproven statement that Burning Wheel was the only successful IP launch since Vampire.<br/><br/>As far as the grain of salt, goes -- Wow, you REALLY don't like it when somebody shows that you're mistaken, do you.....<br/><br/><br/>It's not a sin, you know.
