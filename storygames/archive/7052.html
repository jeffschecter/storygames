You know: we\u2019ve been wanting to play Traveller.<br/><br/>Now, the last time my brother and I played Traveller was back in 1981 or so: we were in high school, and the adventure involved our characters (Air Marshal Fred and Borq the Barbarian) in an escapade aboard a starship that wound up with us driving a grav-tank through the bulkheads of a starship and out an airlock, or something: exactly what you might expect from teenagers let loose upon the universe without adult supervision.<br/><br/>So, at Origins, after an unsatisfying encounter with Star Hero, we decided to just sit down and play Traveller. We found a table in a public place (hoping to rope in some like-minded folks to play with us) and started by generating a few star systems using the Traveller rules. We rolled the dice and checked the tables and set up a four-by-four parsec grid containing about a dozen planets and their starports. The way Traveller works, your dice rolls in succession (somewhat modified by prior rolls) determine your starport type, world size, atmosphere, hydrographic percentage, population size, government type, \u201claw level,\u201d and level of technology. Then you have to look at the numbers and figure out what they mean--why does this barren rock have a population in the billions? Why does this world have a \u201ccaptive government\u201d?<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about the process was how collaborative it was. Answering those sorts of questions is part and parcel of old-style Traveller play--but it was always \u201clonely fun\u201d for the (would-be) referee. When Mike Holmes joined us the next night, I tried to say what a blast it was to brainstorm a sub-sector in that way, but he didn\u2019t seem to get it. He noted that there are computer programs that will map out whole sectors with the push of a button, and files and files of \u201ccanonical\u201d library data for the 11,000 worlds of the Imperium. For Mike, the satisfaction of knowing the canon, or maybe just its very existence (the simmy Dream) made it difficult if not impossible to just let go and have an undefined Imperium emerging in play.<br/><br/>For me though, it was better and more fun to \u201chand-craft\u201d a half-dozen worlds together and agree that oh yes here are aliens and here is a mining outpost and here bitter revanchists of a civil war between this homeworld and its colonies. Fealty to the accreted sediment of 30+ years of \u201ccanon\u201d was less fun than just figuring it out for ourselves at the table.<br/><br/>Mel rolled a character whom he decided was a former intelligence operative and spent a few turns gambling at the starport casino to increase his modest savings. His character Zoltan Hagee was on an alien world that had recently reconquered a breakaway colony in a civil war that some suspected had been fomented by the Imperium. I had him encounter an old friend from his service days who introduced him to an alien \u201cscholar-politician\u201d whose detailed account of the war had been stolen by a rival, possibly with an end to stirring up trouble on the reconquered colony by its more general release (kind of like the Pentagon Papers for bug-eyed monsters). It became a nice noirish cat-and-mouse game as Zoltan shadowed the scholar-politician off-world, came up with a plan to steal the manuscript back, and made the exchange with his old friend, whom Zoltan began to suspect was not as \u201cretired\u201d from intelligence service as he pretended.<br/><br/>Now, we didn\u2019t need a lot of rules to run that adventure, and while Zoltan took a trip aboard a starship, he didn\u2019t own one--even though owning your own starship is supposed to be the big ticket to adventure in Traveller and games like it. The next night, after Mike and another fellow named Cary sat down to play, the PCs in fact bought a ship (with the money they\u2019d made from an orbital heist involving a disabled merchant ship and a cargo of lanthanum). And that was actually less fun, since we dove down into the trade &amp; commerce rules -- how many lots of cargo, worth how much, and so forth. I\u2019d argue the loss of fun value came from how it divorced the die rolls we were making from the actions of characters. <br/><br/>We spent a lot of time loading cargo. Interestingly, as the referee I was largely uninvolved in that process; it was the players checking the tables in the book, the subsector map, and the stats for their ship and figuring out what would work. But only two of the players dug that stuff; Cary I think was left out of the fun.<br/><br/>Were I to play it again, I\u2019d make up simpler trade rules on the fly, tie them to character action (\u201cThis is what you find when you try to drum up some cargo\u201d), and get into space faster. Of course, that raises the question, \u201cIf you\u2019re making up your own rules, at what point are you no longer playing Traveller?\u201d But I think it\u2019s all Traveller: when you look at the published adventures, you see a lot of ad hoc rules created to systematize the situation inherent in the current scenario.<br/><br/>So Mel and I are going to play some more Traveller at Dexcon this week, with the same parameters: collaborative world-building no canon, ad hoc mechanics. If you see us playing, sit down and roll up a character.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156831/#Comment_156831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T05:52:52+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  5:52AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting.

When you get to a new world, roll a handful of Fudge dice.

That's too bad!<br/><br/>Graham, I'd like to see Bleakworlds at some point. The "Traveller Done Right" impulse is a strong one; I think it's a phenomenon that parallels the much-discussed fantasy heartbreaker. I picked up two games at Origins that were arguably TDR games: one called Third Millenium, and another called Hardnova. I haven't really looked through them yet, but Third Millenium at least seems to be very self-consciously emulating Traveller in many respects: world generation is Travelleresque, but the die rolls are completely independent (preceding rolls don't modify their successors), which makes on-the-fly world creation easier (not that they suggest any such thing) and the "meta-setting" of the Thousand Suns is customizable depending upon the players' vision of what a galactic empire (or federation!) should look like. There is some technological updating, but the bones are Traveller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156875/#Comment_156875" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T09:09:10+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:09AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like your idea - it sort of dovetails with the playstorming discussion.  <br/><br/><i>Traveller</i>, as lonely fun, is first rate.

The issue of turning lonely fun into collaborative play is central. But how to preserve that sense of making it up fresh each time while simultaneously establishing things in play that matter, from the level of character action all the way up to setting features and out to the social level of the people at the table contributing to the game. I think the answer lies somewhere in preserving the artifacts of play, but I'm unable to articulate it more distinctly than that.
