The game is centred on three characters: Synthia, her owner/lover Tom Stacy and Agent Maggie R (employee of SRinc dispatched to see what\xe2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong with Synthia). <br/><br/>Basically that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest strength and weakness of the game \xe2\u20ac\u201c it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a laser focused setup, even down to the PCs. There seems a decent scope for exploring those relationships and issues. The challenge for the game now is to develop a mechanical structure that will work better than free form (or jeep form or improv etc). I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure it does.<br/><br/><br/><b>What do the characters do?</b><br/>Erm, I dunno really. Interact I suppose.  <br/><br/><br/><b>How\xe2\u20ac\u2122s it work then?</b><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly complicated system, I had to do quite a bit of deconstructing and writing up formulas until I felt confident I knew how it worked. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to keep track of in terms of Synthia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s stats influencing Stacy\xe2\u20ac\u2122s scores. <br/><br/>Basically there are seven conflict arenas: seduction, investigation, bluffing, interrogation, hide/seek, fighting and chases. Each arena uses two different stats.  <br/><br/>The conflicts have a very cool mechanic in that when one player achieves a move he says what it is and his opponent narrates how it is achieved. Dead simple and totally awesome. I assume aces are worth 11 and face cards 10, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not explicitly mentioned. <br/><br/><br/><b>Where\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the fun?</b><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m utilizing the <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/FUNnel1.htm" rel="nofollow">FUNnel model</a> of RPGs to aid me in the reviewing process. <br/><br/>Gaming <br/>The gaming element is limited, despite the nice conflict resolution system. The lack of character goals or reward mechanics kills off any gaming fun. There are hardly any player decisions to be made during action sequences; only lifestyles or personal effects make a difference and they are in short supply. <br/><br/>Exploration <br/>This is where the fun is to be had, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a loaded situation that should prove interesting to explore. <br/><br/>Narrative<br/>There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the mechanics to deliver narrative fun, nothing to drive the plot. There is an invitation to look at moral issues but little to back it up. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not a lot to drive the PCs into conflict, other than Maggie wanting to avoid her review board.<br/><br/>Immersion<br/>There is good scope for immersion, but the action sequences are a bit jarring \xe2\u20ac\u201c forcing you into author or director stance. I still get the feeling free-form of some description would do the job better. <br/><br/>Unity<br/>The game is pretty disparate, it requires buy in to the situation at the social contract level. It hints at PvP but doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make it explicit.<br/><br/>Smiles<br/>Play it for laughs \xe2\u20ac\u201c now this seems a lot of fun. What if Thomas Stacy resembled Arnold Rimmer? Now you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re talking. <br/><br/><br/><b>My take on it</b><br/>Fixed roles are something I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like in RPGs. I think it becomes too restrictive and reduces replay value. They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t add to the game. Borg, Owner and Bladerunner might work better, letting the players put their own spin on the characters.  <br/><br/>The GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s role is a tad problematic, it sounds quite dull (you have no real influence on the 3 principals) but quite pressured - being responsible for pacing and keeping the players in the fiction. I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t played Spione, it sounds daunting.  I wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fancy doing it, though I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sure lots of GMs would give it a go. <br/><br/>The writing is dead good. The layout is dead annoying \xe2\u20ac\u201c why so long and thin? Why you make me scroll pdf? Grrr. <br/><br/>Sex and violence<br/>There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of scope for violence with firearms being a game ender. Weirdly there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not much emphasis on sex. I want more sex. <br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d say the game requires a strong social contract and a good lever of inter player trust and communication. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not something you could just drop at a con or a gaming club. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure the game is better than free form for exploring the situation. <br/><br/><br/>Design Stats<br/><b>Core</b>: powerful yet sexy<br/><b>Fluff</b>: minimal but satisfying<br/><b>Crunch</b>: should do better (considering the author\xe2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio)<br/><b>Fun</b>: fair to mediocre<br/><br/>This film is rated PG. Potential is good but could do better mechanically. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>+++<br/>JoE<br/>+++                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105861/#Comment_105861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T05:49:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  5:49AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the review, Joe.<br/><br/>You are the most recent victim of my two current obsessions: game mechanics hidden from the reader, and half-letter the tall way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105956/#Comment_105956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T10:00:48+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 10:00AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a place where these contest games are collected so we outsiders can look at them?
