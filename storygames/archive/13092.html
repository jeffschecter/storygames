Once again, kudos to Vincent for the super pdf offer. <br/><br/>Something is puzzling me abpout the Help or Interfere move and its probabilities. I might have my hypothesis and/or my calculation wrong. Don't hesitate to shoot them down if necessary. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hypothesis</span>: I'm a player trying to decide if I should help or interfere. <br/><br/>If I'm in a helpful disposition I'll consider helping if overall probability of success is higher when I help than when I don't. (There is an assumption here -&gt; the MC will systematically complicate the whole situation if I fail my Help roll. Which isn't necessarily true)   <br/>If I'm in an interfering mood I'll consider interfering if overall probability of failure is higher when I interfere than when I don't. (For simplicity sake I discard the case where I fail my Interfere roll because depending on the MC it have many different implications) <br/><br/>So here I detail two cases: one when the target use a trait of zero for their roll and the other when the target benefits of a +2 trait. In both case I arbitrarily decided that my Hx with the target is +1 (72% success of helping/interfering). <br/><br/>move (at 0) 2d6&gt;=7 -&gt; 58% lonesome success <br/>help 2d6&gt;=6 -&gt; 72%, 72% * 72% = 51% -&gt; worse than 58% lonesome probability of success <br/>interfere 2d6&lt;9 -&gt; 73%, 72% * 73% = 52% -&gt;  better than 42% lonesome probability of failure<br/><br/>move (at +2) 2d6&gt;=5 -&gt; 83% lonesome success<br/>help (at +1) 2d6&gt;=4 -&gt; 91%, 72% * 91% = 65% -&gt; worse than 83% lonesome probability of success<br/>interfere (at +1) 2d6&lt;7 -&gt; 42%, 72% * 42% = 30% -&gt;  better than 17% lonesome probability of failure<br/><br/>So here I am with a strong hint that interfering is a good move but helping sucks ass. I mean it as if I was purely gamist in my view of the game. Of course there could fictional reasons that make decisions more complicated. But yeah, it seems helping isn't helping.<br/><br/>What did I do wrong in my reasoning?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295014/#Comment_295014" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T14:36:43+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  2:36PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that there's anything wrong in your reasoning.

It's largely the same if they're at -1 or +1.  +2 or +3, not so much  You're probably better off getting out of their way.<br/><br/>2)  Yeah, helping is best if you've a +2 or a +3 Hx with them.  Once the game is well underway, you're at +2 or +3 with your friends more than 2/3 of the time (gaming the system, slowing down getting to know them better when you're in the +2 to +3 zone)<br/><br/>3)  MCs will tend to be easier on misses from people helping or hindering if that's the kind of hot interaction they want to see in their game.

It varies depending on the situation, but there's a lot of ways for the MC to make a hard move against the helper that doesn't necessarily screw over a successful roll by the original person.  <br/><br/>I mean, heck. By at least one interpretation of the rules as written, if the first PC succeeds in their roll, they succeed. The MC's empowered by the helper's failure to make a hard move, but "They do it if you make a promise" or "You seize it by force, choose 2/3 from below" or whatever still has to happen, yeah? Say what the rules demand. Yeah, I know one of the examples in the book contradicts this. Obviously Vincent doesn't understand his own game.<br/><br/>Also, you only figured out the odds for +1 hx, but keep in mind it's really easy for most characters to start off with a few +2s if not +3s. There's plenty of playbooks that start with +1 with everybody else, and there's plenty of playbooks that give everyone +1 with them, and almost everyone's got a few discretionary choices to make that will strengthen their history with somebody or somebody's history with them. Like, I would recognize that +1 hx is better than average but still kind of risky odds, before making that roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295034/#Comment_295034" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T16:11:52+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  4:11PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ben said.

It feels a little dirty though.

There is a really big difference narratively between a miss (a 6) and a weak hit (7).  That +1 has turned the tide over and over again.  +1 is mighty mighty.<br/><br/>All that aside, applying a purely gamist approach to Apocalypse World strikes me as... less than ideal and maybe even a bit of a red flag.    Maybe I'm helping because the stakes in the conflict are really high and my character feels it's important than another PC succeed even if it puts my character at risk.  Maybe things have been a bit slow and I'm welcoming the opportunity to either be a bad-ass helper or help the MC make my character's life more interesting.<br/><br/><i>Yes, I saw the risk and yet I decided to try to fuck with/save you.

It works well--I highlight it when I'm like, "Ok, I want to see how your character interacts with the others; does he hurt them, help them, not care?" It's definitely led to more helping/hindering than otherwise. When Hx isn't highlighted we don't help/hinder nearly as much.<br><br>As far as a downside, Jason: Not that I can see, from our play. It's all upside. Maybe it doesn't matter, but I'm almost positive that somewhere on the AW forums Vincent said highlighting Hx is cool, no worries. Or something like that. It's why I felt comfortable hacking. I'll see if I can find where he gave his blessing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295278/#Comment_295278" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T16:52:36+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  4:52PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2010 4:53PM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, it's <i>actually</i> <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=162.msg1072#msg1072" rel="nofollow">Vincent by way of John Harper</a>, but whatever.
