Basically, I'm just curious: what's the difference between <i>Bliss Stage: Ignition Stage</i> and <i>Bliss Stage: Interim Stage</i>?  And should I worry about having the former before I obtain the latter, since <i>Ignition Stage</i> appears not to be available anymore?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366767/#Comment_366767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T08:11:30+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're just different editions of the game - same thing with some slight additions. Ben's sometimes a bit too hipster for his own good, that naming convention for the editions and the ambiguity about when the game's "complete" has not done best service for customer confidence <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> In reality you can just buy the most recent printing, whatever it is right now, and be happy with that. The game's been perfectly buyable and playable since the Ignition Stage (assuming that's the black-and-white softcover book Ben printed like three years back). It is a major rpg work both theoretically and artistically, so I recommend it freely to anybody who thinks they might be interested in teenager romance, giant robots and a bleak, hopeless apocalypse. A great game for our generation (meaning mine and Ben's; I seem to remember that you're somehow fossilized, Sam).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366771/#Comment_366771" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T08:23:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clearing that up.  I got the <i>impression</i> that this was the case, but you're right that the naming conventions threw me off, especially with his talk (found in various places) that there would be <i>Bliss Stage: Acceleration</i>, which would be more complete somehow.  I guess I'm more used to simple edition numbering than I am with the language he's using.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>A great game for our generation (meaning mine and Ben's; I seem to remember that you're somehow fossilized, Sam).</blockquote>\nThat's pretty much the size of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366822/#Comment_366822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:00:50+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, IME, the differences aren't big enough to preference one particular edition over another.

It's a little sparse on presentation though, and I'm looking forward to Acceleration Stage as a more beautiful and welcoming edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
