The second and the third are usually enough to make me buy a game, if there is nothing about it that make me think that I will not be able to play it.<br/><br/>This is rather different from last year, when I did buy almost anything that got good word-of-mouth or a good review anywhere. I don't regret the amount of books I brought and I could not play - I was still "learning about the territory" and it was a fast way of doing it - but now I am much more cautious. <br/><br/>The people I trust are, I think, the "usual suspects" that can move a lot of copies with a single actual play thread: Ron, Vincent, and some others (the "others" vary in effect: sometimes they can write an actual play report that get me fired up wanting to play that game RIGHT NOW, other times not. Vincent and Ron have the ability to get that effect every time, if they like very much the game. They know how to write about games. I wrote their names because I think they are in everybody's list, but I don't want to write the other's names to avoid forgetting about somebody or embarassing others)\n<blockquote><br/>Do you find that word of mouth prepares you adequately for the book or PDF that you've purchased?</blockquote>\nNo, if by "word of mouth" you mean the quick citations on story-games or rpg.net. The ones where somebody ask for the "best game to play Romans in Chicago in the '30" and everybody list their favorite game.  I don't even notices these at all these days. A single detailed actual play thread is much better than tens of quick postings.\n<blockquote><br/>Do you read reviews as well?</blockquote>\nAlmost never. The people I trust don't write reviews anymore, it seems, and the people who DO write reviews usually hasn't still earned my trust  (there are always exceptions)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128249/#Comment_128249" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T20:23:31+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  8:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a game solves a design problem I have, or contains a design innovation that I don't feel like I could have come up with, I tend to jump on it.  But the really best way to have me buy a game is to have me hear someone talk excitedly about it and explain it to me.  Podcasts are a good way, but real life or Skype encounters are better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
