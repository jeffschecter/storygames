I discussed our relationship mechanic, how it's centered around ebb and flow on a wheel, and how that influences pretty much every action in the game. I had a slump in development, had to move, had paying work get in the way, yadda yadda. I haven't had much opportunity to update. Last year, you may have seen my previous game Maschine Zeit. Amaranthine's a much bigger, much more ambitious project.<br/><br/>That said, I've been updating a bit more on my website, including a post with the full <a href="http://machineageproductions.com/?p=529" rel="nofollow">Amaranthine: Chapter One</a>. I also opened the floor to allow people to <a href="http://machineageproductions.com/?p=527" rel="nofollow">Immortalize Your City</a>. <br/><br/>The game is one of epic action and romance, set to a modern backdrop. It's loosely inspired by over-the-top urban fantasy action like Highlander (I do say loosely.) The game engine is all about relationships and flashbacks, where you have to improvise the events of your past lives to do great things now. <br/><br/>Anyway, I thought people might be interested in a look. We posted <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/386174176/amaranthine-a-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">Amaranthine Kickstarter</a> to get up the funds for a print run. We'll be updating more and more in the coming weeks. The full release will be Gen Con. I'd love to hit up any questions or curiosities about the game. <br/><br/>-David A Hill Jr<br/>Machine Age Productions                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320197/#Comment_320197" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T16:41:47+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  4:41PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

Yes, you got it there. <br><br>And moment by moment, not yet! We're planning on resolving that this weekend, when we record a game session. <br><br>The mechanics use all D6s. To put it in pretty simple terms, this is how an action is completed: <br/><br/>1) You decide what you want to happen. <br/>2) You compile a sort of dice pool, depending on a character trait and environmental factors. If your pool is equal to or greater than the required hits, you succeed without rolling. This will be most mundane tasks (more so than your average game. Things normal people consider pretty hard are quite easy for the very exceptional Amaranthine.) <br/>3) You determine the target number depending on whether or not you're trained in the thing. <br/>4) You roll. If you rolled, you almost certainly did not succeed as-is. <br/>5) You raise the stakes. You decide how the scene's going to get real. You choose from a couple of options on how you're raising the stakes (advanced skill, superior attachment to fate, or a connection to an otherworldly power.) <br/>6) You roll this now-escalated roll. You may or may not succeed. <br/>7) You keep going. You keep escalating or not, depending on how much you want to risk, and what options to escalate you have left. <br/><br/>Success or failure is success or failure. That gets decided by the rolls and escalation. But, the risks that you put into the event affect your relationships. Relationships are tracked on a little wheel of 24 spaces. Six hot, six cold, six hot, six cold. As you go around the wheel, the relationship ebbs and flows from hot moments to cold moments. Those moments affect your interactions with that person. <br/><br/>I've used Spider Man and Mary Jane as an example. As he's out swinging on rooftops, it risks his relationship with her. It pushes her, stresses her. As he escalates and does riskier things, it pushes her even harder. So he has to manage the flow of that relationship. He knows he has to risk her judgment. He knows he has to displease her sometimes. But to maintain the attachment, he has to work his ass off. <br/><br/>Relationships form the core of your game mechanics, because they provide your player agency points (ala plot point, bennies, what-have-you.) Also, you need to risk things if you want to do awesome things. So you have to spin those wheels. You have to test the limits of those relationships. If you want to kick your enemy's ass on a late-night rooftop battle, there's going to be hell to pay when you get home.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/machineiv" title="machineiv"><img alt="machineiv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/machineiv">machineiv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320444/#Comment_320444" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T23:11:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2011 11:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That went a little long, and it's a little rough.

The one big thing we wanted to address with our creation rules was making certain that every one of the player characters has a strong relationship to the others from the outset. So in addition to standard generation rules, we have a roundtable discussion as part of the process, where you address four statements about your history with the others. So you'll state that you've "always" done something with them, "sometimes" done something with them, "once" done something with them, and "never" done something with them.

I decided for a last-ditch push, in the form of a completely new game. It's a quirky little social story game, that's ideal for conventions and other occasional meetups where you only have a short burst of time to play. Here's the announcement: <br/><br/>I\u2019m pleased to announce the next Machine Age Productions roleplaying/story game. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cDavid! You\u2019re not even fully finished with Amaranthine! Are you going to work yourself to death?\u201d Yes. This game won\u2019t see production until after Amaranthine\u2019s done on our end. So we\u2019re lining up our next bit of work. Also, we have this interesting final push project for the Kickstarter.<br/><br/>Also, everyone that gets shipped a physical item gets a badge. As promised. The ones we\u2019ve gotten so far are pretty damned cool.<br/><br/><b>Guestbook: A Collectible Flash Fiction RPG</b><br/>In the grim dorkness of the far future, there is only wargaming, video gaming, and alternative reality gaming. The wells of roleplaying stories have dried up. Really, how many times can you reskin Tolkien and Lucas and call it a new release? In the future of gaming, nobody has the attention span for \u201ccampaigns.\u201d Gamers have kids and jobs, laws keep players from neglecting either of those things. Story games must be played in thousand word bursts, lest the gods of real life interrupt and ruin narrative flow.<br/><br/>In Guestbook, you play normal people, in extraordinary situations, and you do it really damned quick. Then, you trade with your friends, and repeat at the next possible opportunity. Every character in Guestbook is a self-contained product (but you need two players to play.) Each character is a brochure-style, full-color screen that doubles as a GM/Player screen you can use while playing other games (and so you can play Guestbook during lulls in play!) At first, we intend to release about five character sheets, with more to follow, depending on popularity and demand. You\u2019ll be able to buy them at Gen Con for a nominal fee, or from us directly. You will also be able to purchase them in PDF form so you can print them out of your own accord.<br/><br/>Each sheet will have ten story seeds, along with some simple, special rules for playing through the scenario with your partner. Basically, you tell a short story in three acts with a very simple resolution mechanic. That mechanic is\u2026 *drum roll* rock-paper-scissors. Yet, every single character sheet gets a unique hand gesture for use in their rock-paper-scissors challenges. After you each play through your scenarios, you sign your Guestbook (one of the panels of the brochure) and you trade character sheets. Then, you go about, playing the new character you got from your partner, signing, and trading again.<br/><br/>As well, I\u2019ll be setting up a Twitter account and hashtag for the game. So, if you\u2019re playing at a convention (the best place for Guestbook, by far,) you can Tweet your achievements so they\u2019re on record. You know, since you give up your signatures when you play again. Guestbook is a highly social game, made for quick game interactions, great icebreakers, and assorted awesomeness. You want a game you can play for Gamer Speed Dating? Guestbook is your game. You want something you can do with the Single Serving Friend you made at the airport after a convention? Guestbook. The idea would be, the game is affordable and quick enough that you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with passing off a brochure to another player, to spread the love and make games happen. Every Guestbook brochure will have ten story seeds on it, and there\u2019s theoretically a limitless number of situations to play with.<br/><br/>Not only will we periodically release more characters, we\u2019ll release some for exclusive benefits. Some might go for charity bundles. Some might come as pack-ins for Machine Age games. Some might be written by other publishers as bonuses for their products. One will only go to the last-minute contributors to Amaranthine\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/><b>Final Kickstarter Push!</b><br/>So Guestbook plays into our last 44 hour Kickstarter push. We\u2019re going to design five main characters to start. In these last 44 hours, you can buy some in advance, at random. If you do so, you will get a special, unique character that we\u2019re only releasing for this Kickstarter promo. Here\u2019s the setup: Anyone that does a new bid of $20 or more before the end gets one random character, and the Kickstarter promo character. If you raise your existing bid by $10, you get a random character, and you get the Kickstarter promo character. If you raise by $15, you get two randoms (I will not duplicate them, so you get variety) and the Kickstarter promo. $20 will get you all five starter characters, and the Kickstarter promo character. That way you can play with all your friends. You know, if you only have five friends.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter's <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/machineage/amaranthine-a-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">Amaranthine Kickstarter</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
