What are some of the more unique ways you've seen of improving a character without using an "experience" chart?  I'm mostly just interested in the theory, although if you have any great suggestions for LARP in particular I'd be very interested.<br/><br/>I wrote up a quick list of the stuff I could think of offhand.<br/><b>Trad. Games</b>: XP for killing things, accomplishing goals, sometimes good RP.  Levels are tiers which give you points to spend on skills, spells, feats, proficiencies, and whatnot.<br/><b>Video games</b>: Pretty much the same as Trad. Games, but some just hand you items for finishing levels (Zelda, Megaman), some use "upgrades" such as providing money with which to upgrade a vehicle, and some use a skill system, where the more you use a skill the better it gets.  Also achievements.<br/><b>Indy/Story RPGs</b>: XP or bonuses are mostly based on good RP rather than accomplishments.  Player may get benefits/rerolls to random events (usually in the form of spendable points) or recognition in game (such as a title or IC contacts or money with which to buy better things.)<br/><b>LARP</b>: Based mostly on showing up and for good RP, and in some cases, paying OOC money for additional XP.  Some LARPs don't have character sheets at all, of course.<br/><b>Board Games</b>: Perhaps Risk: Legacy, where the board changes permanently with every game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427105/#Comment_427105" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T13:02:06+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  1:02PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've vastly oversimplified what "Trad Games" give XP for, or rather you're using a broad category term that is essentially meaningless.

Mechanical character efficacy (character powers or stats, usually) is one of them and is generally the most obvious.<br/><br/>In many adventure games, equipment and other resources is often part of your "advancement" - you usually have better stuff later than you do earlier. Though the opposite is possible - you can start with resources that you use up as you go and that don't necessarily get replaced.<br/><br/>Knowledge and/or "leverage" can by another kind of advancement. When you learn how to deal appropriately with a given person or culture, you have a type of ongoing power that you didn't have before. When you learn a secret you can leverage against someone, you have power you didn't previously have.<br/><br/>Relationship development can be a type of advancement. If you have befriended someone with power (or many people with a little power) you have gained a kind of power that you didn't have before, if you can get them to do something on your behalf.<br/><br/>Mechanics aptitude - learning the ins and outs of the game system and how to make more optimal decisions - can be a kind of player-based advancement. New players may not understand when is the best time to use up a healing potion versus when to go looking for a healing caster, for example.<br/><br/>I'm probably leaving out something.<br/><br/>I think you need to take into consideration the whole spectrum of different areas of advancement when designing a game. <br/><br/>For example, the simplest sort of RPG economy - where you give players coins as loot on bodies and they save up those coins and buy equipment with it that boosts their efficacy - is a kind of second XP track that many designers don't think of as such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427114/#Comment_427114" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T14:25:32+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  2:25PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html" rel="nofollow">Designing Rewards in Games</a><br/><br/>The text is about computer games, but can be applied to roleplaying games as well.

Maybe we've played five sessions -- that's five weeks of real time spent on the game, so let's think about leveling the characters up. Maybe the PCs accomplished something significant -- worth leveling up for? Or maybe the PCs have accomplished a substantial number of minor things -- could be worth a level.<br/><br/>The goal was mostly to let everyone have fun at, say, level 3 for a while, doing all the level 3 kinds of things, and then when level 3 started to feel stale we'd move on to level 4. Since our games usually run 16-24 sessions before we hit a stopping point and move on to something new, we'd get to level up anywhere from 3 to 8 times, depending on how we were feeling about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427120/#Comment_427120" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T16:26:00+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  4:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>Just using dice, especially when you have a mechanic like critical hits, could be considered variable ratio scheduled rewards, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427122/#Comment_427122" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T16:36:26+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  4:36PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for larp-specific advice, the biggest problem I've seen repeatedly (and again and again) in campaign larps is the eventual splitting of the player base between high powered old experienced characters and new characters.

In fact many Story Games are specifically reactions against nebulous 'good roleplaying' awards and instead try to tie advancement into concrete actions, either of the player or character.

But you will still, I fear, suffer from low-level whiffing (or irrelevance) and high-level apathy (no challenge). And you need to look at both earning and spending rewards, which gives you two 'faucets' in that economy instead of just one drain.<br/><br/>I offer a number of reward systems approaches for <a href="http://glasscutters.org/GLASS.pdf" rel="nofollow">GLASS</a>, each of which reinforces one type of game or game tone:<br/>11 Rewards<br/>11.1 Information<br/>Information is any note, clue, riddle, drawing, photo, etc that helps characters complete situational goals in the game. GMs are encouraged to come up with compelling and creative forms of Information for players to find, but a simple note can suffice to advance plotlines.<br/>...<br/><br/>11.2 Money<br/>Most\u2014but by no means all\u2014game settings have some form of Money, if not several denominations of Money. When it is used, GMs will supply Money Props; though player-run economies can be entertaining and often emerge during long-running games, complete with player-backed banks and player-guaranteed notes. Money is most often employed in games to provide a means for PCs and SCs to acquire Items from ECs. When this is the case, players are quick to offer each other goods and services in exchange for Money, so long as it is useful for character advancement. GMs <i>will not </i>provide Money if they are not going to provide EC vendors; leave it to the players to create their own economies if they can trade only amongst themselves.<br/>At no time is a GM required to guarantee Money or to adjudicate any financial disputes between players, whether they are using GM-supplied or player-created Money (though an EC or several ECs might serve in these roles in a particular game).<br/>Props may be as simple as Tags or printed notes and certificates\u2014signed by a GM to help to avoid counterfeiting\u2014or as fancy as custom metal tokens and ingots that can be ordered from novelty supply companies.<br/><br/>11.3 Experience<br/>...<br/>Earning Experience<br/>Characters can earn Experience just for participating in the game, or they might have to surmount in-game challenges or defeat fearsome foes to earn Experience. GMs will designate the way in which a character can earn Experience, using one or both of these Toggles:<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427150/#Comment_427150" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-14T08:34:25+00:00" title="January 14, 2014  8:34AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2014 8:35AM by David Artman.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Static Gain \u2013 At each Reset, characters receive Experience equal to a percentage of Starting Experience. The GMs will specify a percentage from 1% to 5%, based on how rapidly they feel characters should gain efficacy in the game setting.<br/>* Variable Gain \u2013 Experience is generally earned during play for successful completion of game tasks. When guiding a group through a scenario, GMs often have Experience to hand out to clever or feat-performing players. In planned or random encounters, ECs usually have Experience that is given to the first character that searches them after they are Dead, though it is common for players to distribute EC Experience among all characters who helped to win a conflict.<br/>...<br/>Spending Experience<br/>Players spend Earned Experience during a Reset. The GMs will designate the way in which a player can spend Experience on a character, using one of these Options:<br/>* Zero Growth \u2013 Experience that is spent on a character after it has been through a Reset may only be spent on Abilities that have the Single Use, Focus, or Tool Limitation (or a combination of them). The Ability Up Cost is adjusted by the Minuses for those Limitations to get the Final Cost as normal, and further Limitations or Advantages may be applied as normal.<br/>* Balanced Growth \u2013 When players spend Experience on their characters, they must balance the expenditure with a Defect worth equivalent Experience, for which they do not receive Bonus Experience as they would at character creation. This option represents a game in which gaining additional capabilities above and beyond Starting Experience \u201ccorrupts\u201d or \u201cdegenerates\u201d a character. This Option is most useful for games with frequent new players, as no one\u2019s net total Experience is higher than anyone else\u2019s.<br/>* Constrained Growth \u2013 Experience that is spent on a character after it has been through a Reset is worth less as more of it is spent by the same player. However, it may be spent in any way. Experience Ranks are defined as multiples of the game\u2019s Starting Experience; thus, a character\u2019s Rank is determined by dividing the total Experience spent on the character by the game\u2019s Starting Experience (rounding down). Each successive character Rank after Rank 1 doubles the previous Rank\u2019s Experience cost for any and all new expenditures on that character. This cost adjustment is refigured after each discrete expenditure: a single point increase to an Ability or Attribute, the total purchase of a new Ability, or paying off a Defect.<br/>Thus, it is possible for a character to go up in Rank while in the middle of spending Earned Experience during a Reset.<br/>* Unlimited Growth \u2013 Players pay normal Final Costs for any and all Experience expenditures. GMs will use the Experience Ranks in Constrained Growth above, to provide clear indicators during the course of play as to what challenges are appropriate to which characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427151/#Comment_427151" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-14T08:49:00+00:00" title="January 14, 2014  8:49AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2014 8:50AM by David Artman.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, your ideas are a combination of Constrained Growth and an unusual solution for Ranks; i.e., instead of Rank-based <i>access</i> to segregated scenarios, you suggest Rank-based access to challenges <i>within </i>scenarios--clever... and STOLEN! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I prefer Balanced Growth in long-running games, especially if they are meant to be at all 'realistic' or 'modern'.<br/>I prefer Zero Growth for one-off or mini-series, where efficacy often takes a back seat to narrative.<br/>For high-fantasy and the like, Constrained Growth works well in conjunction with Static Gain (which itself can be throttled down on a per-Rank basis, perhaps all the way to Zero Growth for characters above Rank 3).*<br/><br/>Also, don't discount 'The Gold Watch': build a (sub)plot with the consent of a(the) highest-level character(s) that is designed to kill them off with style!

Games very much influenced by MUDs and MUSHs in which the 'ultimate' awards were to <i>run </i>the game (or at least areas of the game)!

Characters grow toward a cap that is known when they start. Once they hit the cap (or cap range) they will retire their character and start over. If you want to have a more danger-focused version, then have a campaign with relatively high "death" but easy resurrection. After reaching cap, you lose the ability to rez.<br/><br/>The thing I like about cyclical growth is that is allows for cyclical spotlight time - everyone gets to be top-of-the-heap for a while, after which they resolve their storylines (something often lacking in campaign larps) and start a new character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
