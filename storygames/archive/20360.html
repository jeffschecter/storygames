It leans a bit more to Over the Top and Action than Realism and is part of my interest in making games where the players are not good people.<br/><br/>It would be super cool if you wanted to give it a try. I'm pretty happy with where it's at, but this is pretty much the first I'm getting it out in front of people who aren't just my friends. If you do give it a go, I'd love to hear about it and what you think.<br/><br/>You can find the rules over here: <a href="https://cosr.wordpress.com/paper-games/211-2/" rel="nofollow">https://cosr.wordpress.com/paper-games/211-2/</a><br/><br/>I'm currently working on another small, short form hack, with something longer form in the pipeline. I'm hoping to start getting them out in front of other people sooner than with 211.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
