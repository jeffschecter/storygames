I played \u201cThe Red-Haired Prince\u201d and my themes were Sexuality and Hunting. The player who sets the scene has his character as the focus. To help you set the scene, there are Location cards, which have their own goodness to choose from (theme, events, various interpretations of the location). The Location is controlled by the player to the right. <br/><br/>We didn\u2019t use the events on the location cards much. Personally, I had some trouble figuring out how to control the Locations. I had an easier time controlling the Themes (I controlled The White Haired Princess\u2019 themes: the magical bird who raised her, the Karab, and her Cruelty). <br/><br/>Ok. So there\u2019s the White Haired Princess (magical and aloof), The Queen (stern, with her own agenda), The Red Haired Prince (horny and learned), The Black Haired Princess (innocent and ambitious) and The Bald Prince (a wise general, a fierce warrior, unable to sire children). We named them all in our playtest: Fera, The Queen\u2019s name I can\u2019t recall, Olgur, Feravan and Baggin, respectively. <br/><br/>First of all: this is the most erotic tabletop RPG experience I\u2019ve ever had. I think it has to do with both the themes and set up of the game and the constellation of players (three dudes, two very lovely ladies). The atmosphere was\u2026 charged, but not in an icky way. Good, fun, adult entertainment. (This is of course highly subjective and I might just be a horn-dog, but y\u2019know). <br/><br/>There were subtly sensual scenes, hardcore scenes and full frontal nudity. In our heads, that is. <br/><br/>The Karab bird is a very cool feature, as it isn\u2019t really defined pre game. The game text just states that it raised the White Haired Princess. It became very central to our endgame. <br/><br/>The story unfolded thus:<br/><br/>* The Red Haired Prince is riding along the endless steppe. He is returning from hunting in the northern lands, and has bested the near-mythical beast the Fuck-I-Forget, a one-horned antelope of some sort. He meets a legless prophet in a tent who basically tells him that he is about to fuck shit up. In the literal and metaphorical sense.<br/><br/>* The White Haired Princess finds two young lovers, who turn out to be siblings, naked in front of the Fire Altar. She sacrifices the girl (yep, she is cruel) because the Karab bird has taught her that the fire altar craves innocence. <br/><br/>* The Bald Prince visits the Karab\u2019s nest, a temple on a mountain top. He is first questioned by the blind lady in the fiery pit, then approaches the bird and perceives it to be just a small, shabby parakeet. His soldiers however fall to the ground in prayer. The Bald Prince kneels, and his ears are burnt as his innate magical power (that he cannot really control) reaches out to listen to the words of the Karab. The Karab seems to be scheming against the Queen. It also tells the Bald Prince that with the White Haired Princess, he will be able to sire children.<br/><br/>* The Queen and her maid in the Queen\u2019s bedchamber. The Queen sends toxic black flowers to the king of the north. <br/><br/>* The Black Haired Princess watches the approach of the princes and their men. It is the first time she sees men, ever. She feels weird sensations she\u2019s never felt before. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> She drops her handkerchief, but doesn\u2019t see who picks it up. Then she goes to the stables, and meets the two men. Both of them have her handkerchief, but the Red Haired Prince presents it to her first and puts the moves on her. Brags about the horn he captured from the fabled beast of the north. Compliments her beauty, which is renowned in faraway lands. The Bald Prince tries to hide his handkerchief, but she notices. The handkerchief is cut in half. <br/><br/>* The Red Haired Prince is chasing The Black Haired Princess through the garden maze. It is nighttime, and the stars are out. She beckons him to follow her, but escapes until he calls his bird, the hunting falcon. It lands on her shoulders and startles her. He turns the corner, laughing, but is perplexed to see that the bird has left cuts upon her shoulder. It has never before harmed a human being. The prince kisses away the blood. They go together to the centre of the maze, where the black flowers grow. He seduces her \u2013 or she lets him think so \u2013 but as he enters her, the White Haired Princess approaches. He is distracted, pulls out, and the black haired princess runs away. He asks the White Haired Princess for a gift. She laughs at him. She is strangely able to control his bird far better than he can. He invites her to go hunting, and she agrees. <br/><br/>* The White Haired Princess has an argument with her mother the Queen. She doesn\u2019t want to marry either prince. The Queen tries to convince her that she is free to do as she pleases. <br/><br/>* The Bald Prince takes his men to the brothel outside the palace walls. He is seduced by what seems to be one of the female palace guards. They make love, and his magical gift leaves a black, hand shaped scar on her shoulder. We will later learn that the woman was the Black Haired Princess in disguise. It is established that the Bald Prince\u2019s magical gift leaves his body and enters hers.  <br/><br/>* The Queen and the Black Haired princess discuss the affront of the Red Haired Prince: he has come to their lands, hurt her with his animal and violated her. The laws of the land (oh, that\u2019s another feature of the game I forgot, by the way: the matriarchy has these strict rules against hurting women) demands that he be punished according to the Black Haired Princesses\u2019 wishes. <br/><br/>* The Black Haired Princess in the lighthouse, where the Bald Prince has lit the lantern. She reveals that it was in fact she who was in the brothel. (And I think she threatened him that she could now mete out any punishment she wanted over him). <br/><br/>* It is established that the Red Haired Prince didn\u2019t manage to impress the White Haired Princess with the hunting trip. So he decides to go hunting the most fabled creature of these lands: The Karab. He fails miserably, ending up killing his own falcon by the temple in the mountains, after meeting an apparition of his deceased mother. <br/><br/>* The White Haired Princess and The Black Haired Princess in the throne room. A quarrel ensues when The White Haired Princess senses the new magical power her sister possesses. \u201cYou have something that <br/>belongs to me\u201d, she demands, and magically attacks her sister, siphoning the power out of her body, into her own. <br/><br/>* The Bald Prince approaches the Queen in the throne room, demanding her daughter \u2013 the White Haired Princess\u2019 hand. The Queen refuses, and suggests that he marries her instead! He kills her with his sword, stabbing her in the heart. As the Queen\u2019s blood trickles on the black and white marble floor, the White Haired Princess enters the room. She attacks the Bald Prince, and as she does so she turns to flames with all the new magical power she now possesses. But here we draw the resolution card: \u201cYes, but there\u2019s a detail that doesn\u2019t go quite as planned.\u201d So she succeeds in putting her fiery hand into his chest, but as she does so her magical powers, old and new, leave her and enter the Bald Prince, who turns into some sort of lava golem as the White Haired Princess turns to ash. He tries to touch her, but pieces of the princess falls to the floor. His lava tears mingle with the ashes, and an egg appears. <br/><br/>Epilogues:<br/><br/>* The Black Haired Princess has decided upon the punishment of the Red Haired Prince: He has to wed her. <br/><br/>* The mummified corpse of the Queen listens in on the marriage ceremony. She can still hear, but she cannot do anything\u2026<br/><br/>* The Red Haired Prince dies happily in the middle of the garden maze, laying on the black, toxic flowers, having visions of fornicating with the White Haired Princess (as was his intention and goal all along)<br/><br/>* The Bald-Prince-Turned-Golem climbs the steps to the temple on the mountain, leaves the egg in the fiery bit and watches over it until it hatches. As it hatches, a bright light appears, and he sees his mother. She touches him, and he is healed. Then his mother takes the shape of a fiery bird and soars skywards. <br/><br/>To Be Continued\u2026<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426465/#Comment_426465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T07:32:15+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  7:32AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys had a weird, sexy game, Ole Peder!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
