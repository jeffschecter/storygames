It really doesn't explain the game's nuts and bolts, but whatever. Style beats substance in some cases.<br/><br/>What I would love to explore sometime is the possibility of ANOTHER place in the game to put the nuts-and-bolts section. The last printed page?<br/><br/>If you ever look at popular hardcover books, the back blurb never has shit about the book. You have to open the book and read the inside flap of the dust jacket, and even then you usually have to skip about 2 paragraphs of "From Award Winning Author xxxxxx..." and the like before we ever get to a brief summary of what the game is about.<br/><br/>Where, in stylish RPGs, can we put the nuts and bolts text? Traditionally, it goes on the back cover. I wouldn't mind seeing it on the first 2 or last page of the book...<br/>-----<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Most of you have seen hardcovers and know what I'm talking about: The back cover either is just more art, or a bunch of one-sentence huzzahs from reviewers. The actual "What the hell is in the book" only appears on the inner flap of the dust jacket, and usually a few paragraphs down.<br/><br/>Softcovers tend to put the blurb on the back, but not always.  Sometimes the blurb is on the first three pages of the text. Very rarely on the last page or two.<br/><br/>Any thoughts for RPGs?  I'm thinking that, if I (I being "anyone") wants to go with a flowery pretty back cover blurb or just more art, where would be a good place to stick the "back cover blurb"?  How should it be changed, if placed somewhere else?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81480/#Comment_81480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T10:55:11+00:00" title="July 16, 2007 10:55AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, do you mean a mechanical/structural description of the game as played, rather than the all-color description of the fiction produced?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

For Bullseye, I'm toying with the back cover for the sell pitch. The interior of the front and back cover will be identical one-page summaries of the system. As a general rule, you should not need to pay extra to print in B&amp;W on the interior of a soft cover (just like you don't for full four-page sheets of the interiors--the paper itself is the big cost).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81501/#Comment_81501" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T12:36:36+00:00" title="July 16, 2007 12:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Andy, do you mean a mechanical/structural description of the game as played, rather than the all-color description of the fiction produced?</blockquote>\nHmm. Lemme provide examples for what I'm talking about:  Check the blurb on the Sufficiently Advanced thread.  I dig that blurb. It doesn't tell me anything about the game, but it's a colorful, poetic blurb that gets me warm to play in the nethers.<br/><br/>Legends of Alyria is a black book, the back cover IIRC simply has two quotes (one from Ron, one from Ben), and nothing "crunchy" about what the game is, what it is about etc.<br/><br/>I just realized that with LoA, the Back Cover Blurb is actually the Lulu website where you buy it from.  That's where you get this:<br/><br/>"One thousand years have passed since the Rape of Alyria. Within the walls of the Citadel, men bow to a god of Iron and Thunder, and pay homage to the Keepers, priests of this fearful god. To the east, another nation has risen. Tales speak of the Ark, and their masked people without names. Dragon cultists worship in dark places and infiltrate the halls of power, seeking to return their masters to the surface. A red, blood moon rises above the horizon, a harbinger of doom, for the Outsiders have returned. Welcome to the world of Alyria."<br/><br/>Normally, a "back cover blurb" will also say, "This is a Roleplaying game of hard choices and action. Using the dynamic BLUEPIE system and a few d10s, you and your friends will soon be creating heroes to adventure in the fabulous would of Dinkmarr." Or something.<br/><br/>However, on some games these days we see the traditional back cover blurb being removed in favor of a more flavorful, almost poetic thingamabob that doesn't really tell us anything about the game (like sufficiently advanced).  My idea is that there still could be a "traditional back cover blurb" with far more description, but perhaps placed somewhere else in the book. Like the inside back cover, or the first or second printed page of the book, etc.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81514/#Comment_81514" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T13:12:35+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  1:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about the inside flap of the dust jacket?<br/><br/>What do you mean, you don't have a dust jacket?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81515/#Comment_81515" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T13:15:18+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  1:15PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just thinking "It's too bad you can't print on the inside of the cover with the various POD places."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
