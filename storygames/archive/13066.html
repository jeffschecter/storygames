Scribing of OUR STORY</i> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/><br/>by Laughing &lt;s&gt;Willow Gift<br/><br/>We got a letter!  Melanie's planet has been eaten by a whale!  She has a cat and cookies.  We should help!  (I'll try not to think too hard on how the letter got *out* of the whale).  Eccentric Worm got a MASSIVE tummy ache because he drank tons of milk before we even left.  Clever Ox beat us All to the whale (he's soo fast) and pulled a teensy planet out of the whale's eye.  Unfortunately, he talked so long and used so many big words on Melanie's behalf, that the poor whale's tiny brain became overwhelmed and it fell asleep.  Now, we have to get inside a sleeping whale! &gt;.&lt;  And then, I had this REALLY GREAT idea!  We were gonna get the kitty to tackle the whale and wake up! But they all messed up and said the wrong stuff, so the kitty was confused and they blamed me!  The whale did wake up, and told us his teeth tickled.  Friendly Hamster <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believed</span> him (!!!) and flew into the whale's mouth and was eaten!  Luckily, Freindly Hamster had a candle.  When he lit it to see by, the whale sneezed and he escaped!  Also, the inside of the whale smells good for Melanie now, at least until we rescue her.  Honest Arrow snuck inside the whale and led Melanie (+ cat) our of it's ear.  But!  Realizing, via Honest Arrow's big mouth, that her trees would perish, she didn't wanna go!  And you will NOT BELIEVE, but Eccentric Worm got rid of his tummy ache by making himself <span style="text-decoration: underline;">throw up</span>!!!  Eeeeeeew! Then, apparently, Clever Ox learned whaled tongue (I guess because he never, ever stepped talking to it this whole time?), and made the whale laugh and laugh with a joke none of us could understand.  The whale was mad at me, too, (even though it was an AWESOME idea), so I went around and collected all the krill in a 20 mile radius, using my Ultra Magical Rational Fearsome Bandana 5000!  Unfortunately, I guess it wasn't enough... the whale got mad at me.  Ooh!  Ooh! But then, Friendly Hamster tapped into some super awesome Pilgrim Powers and chewed through the whale's fear of losing that which is closest to him.  The whale gave him Melanie's house back in thanks!  But I guess she convinced him that it's not her house, her house is MUCH bigger (which is weird, because this house had "Melanie" on the mailbox and pictures of her and the cat on the wall...)<br/>          And so we did it!<br/>Eccentric Worm gave Melanie cookies as a nice homecoming!  (Wait, weren't we supposed to get cookies?)<br/>Clever Ox and the whale became good friends, and the whale tought him many good jokes!<br/>Laughing Willow and Melanie became best friends and made friendship bracelets together.  From kelp!  It's organic.<br/>Friendly Hamster got a house from the whale made of gingerbread with cotton candy smoke.<br/>Honest Arrow is praised for leading Melanie, and he got a parade with Patriotic Pootsie Rolls.<br/><br/>Friendly Hamster is now Chibi Hamster, because he got even cuter!<br/>Honest Arrow is now Honest Bridge, because he loves bringing people together.<br/>Eccentric Worm became Hungry Worm, because he LOVES delicious food and drink.<br/>Clever Ox left the temple, and became a comedian.  We wish him luck.<br/>And I am now Laughing Gift, because I find joy in providing for people's worldy comfort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351120/#Comment_351120" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T17:31:52+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  5:31PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
