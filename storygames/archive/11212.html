I\u2019m no longer amazed by the number of \u201cviolence is never the answer\u201d goals that lead to exactly that. I write down, \u201cmy goal is to build bridges\u201d and then proceed to burn them down. Once play starts, it doesn\u2019t matter what I said I wanted, anything goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlenty of Fish is one of the biggest dating websites in North America, four times larger than Match.com. It\u2019s ugly with almost non existent customer service. But it\u2019s effective. They create 80,000 successful relationships a year. How? They don\u2019t listen to their users.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s not true. They do listen. They don\u2019t listen to what they say but what they do. If you tell Plenty of Fish you like blond nonsmokers but spend all your time clicking and gawking nicotine-addled brunettes, the system adopts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBurning Wheel does this. People complain that Beliefs are a way to control player characters. They\u2019re not. You\u2019re rewarded when you play your Beliefs AND when you play against them. And you can change them!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou\u2019re not rewarded for how your character behaves. You\u2019re rewarded for how you communicate. It\u2019s a feedback system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m not holding up Burning Wheel as the end all be all. It\u2019s not. Nothing is. It might just be scratching the surface. If anything, these feedback systems aren\u2019t \u201creal time\u201d enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s why nothing beats a traditional Game Master who\u2019s a phenomenal listener.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best system can\u2019t beat the best GM in terms of real time content customization. Non-computer systems aren\u2019t intelligent or responsive enough. Hell, computer ones aren\u2019t. People rule here. But not everyone is a phenomenal listener. And that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make better tools. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this. I want better tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t have the answer.

That sort of thing has a lot of horse-and-cart about it though - there needs to be a way to define traits as meaningful, to the greatest extent possible, such that they'll actually get used, but then again it's not so bad to have some "turnover" and allow for a character to change over time. <i>Polaris</i> handles this in part by making individual Aspects distinct, in the scene economy, from Themes - you exhaust an entire Theme at once, but you come up with in-the-moment content based on specific Aspects. <br><br>A lot of games are very bad at being responsive in this way - how many Dungeons and Dragons/World of Darkness games have we played where character creation feels like packing for a trip, but you don't know where you're flying or where you might be eating and recreating when you get there! I've tried to take the opposite approach: choose a skill, and I'll try to make it important in play, but there's a certain sluggishness to this. What if a player's priorities change over time, like you said?<br><br>I think that having a relatively small number of character abilities is better than having too many, and would certainly push matchmaking of different traits to the forefront: in <i>Firefly</i>, there's an episode called 'Shindig' in which Inara's (secret) love for Mal helps him win a sword-fight. Mal knows absolutely nothing about fencing or disciplined use of hand-weapons, so he's going to be killed by his opponent, Atherton, unless something else happens. It does: (I think...) Inara tells Atherton she'll marry him if he lets Mal live, and Mal uses that as a diversion and beats the guy's face in. Some kind of... "Secretly, I Love Mal" trait would be used there, such that Mal could switch from Fancy Fightin' to just plain Fightin', a skill that he actually has. I think it's debatable that you'd have to even differentiate Fancy Fightin' permanently, seeing as there are a few occasions in which the crew's more rough-and-tumble physical and social abilities fall short in the face of Alliance technology, fancy fencing technique, or so-phisticated rich-folk etiquette.<br>It's a bit like having Guest Star skills, maybe. I dunno. I'll give it some thought!                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249212/#Comment_249212" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T18:26:15+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  6:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traits and Instincts in Burning Wheel and Aspects in FATE kinda work like this: they drive story when you work for or against them.

Traditional roleplaying games don't act like stories. They try to act like some approximation of life. With In Media Res, a characters' abilities aren't so much determined ahead of time as they are "discovered" during play. Who would have thought that a high-class hooker like Inara would know anything about fencing? Did Rodenberry determine when he created the Vulcans that they would have an inner eyelid that would protect Spock from being permanently blinded in one episode? I seriously doubt that these things would be worked into the characters until the writer of that episode needed them to have that skill or ability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276079/#Comment_276079" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T06:47:25+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  6:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 7:19AM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My recent Actual Play in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11960" rel="nofollow">Running Shadowrun for \u201creal life Shadowrunners\u201d is hard!</a> and David's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12308" rel="nofollow">the fiction: individual player visions -&gt; shared group vision?</a> reminded me of this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mention above:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Burning Wheel does this.

Which creates fictional drama but also confirms that those beliefs are still relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276182/#Comment_276182" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T12:43:52+00:00" title="June 15, 2010 12:43PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 2:06PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that in my Burning Empires game, I learned a ton about writing good Beliefs from playing with BW veterans.  It wasn't just discovering what I really wanted to do; it was more about what I really wanted to do <i>and could do</i> in the context of this game with these people.  The feedback system was quite effective; when I was pissed that I didn't get to work toward my Beliefs, I thought, "Holy shit, Matt was able to work toward <i>three</i> of his!  How'd he pull that off?"<br><br>On the subject of "actions speak louder", I really need to try Universalis soon.  "Everyone claims what they want in the fiction..." by itself sounds awful to me, but complete that with "...by <i>paying for it</i>" and I love it.<br><br>I agree there's no substitute for a GM who can respond to what the players' behavior reveals about their true desires.  I wonder if there's any way to train that sensitivity; to tell a GM, "Here are a few specifics to look for, that'll tell you what you need to know."  I suspect there's no way to chop all RPG desires into some recognizable categories, but in a given game, if you know what the likely suspects are, that might be a start.  Like, for Shadowrun, maybe a few axes like Epic/Gritty, Cinematic/Simulationy, Action/Emotion could point out, "Hey, if the players want a small-scale, character-exploring experience rather than a world-saving movie full of stunts, that makes a difference!"                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276192/#Comment_276192" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T13:06:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  1:06PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a mechanical idea.<br><br>Your skill list or trait list or whatever has little key icons next to each blank line. <img alt="image" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/adamdray/pic/00018y7w"/><br><br>By default, these skills and traits are unlocked.

The soft limitations of Arcana spending means that players tend to put their actions where their words are. If you wanted to be more magically and scholarly you had to act more magically and scholarly. We actually had a spy character who started seducing people in one scene and ended up embracing an unexpected dual arcana path for her character (lovers and empress) half because of the fiction and half because of the positive feedback. Artesia is a game where you can actually "fake it till you make it", which I must say is pretty impressive. <br><br>Speaking from a year or so game of Artesia I ran, I would cut the magic and combat systems down brutally and balance the lifepaths (at least a little), all before taking much of a knife to the Arcana system. If you must though, I suggest scaling down the Arcanas by a factor of 2 - removing or reworking world to match. Arcana is basically an onus on the GM, and that means having a decent sense for what each one means. But you need enough variety to represent different avenues of stories, with overlap of both abilities and themes. That means that a subtle turn can make your seducer into a Lover or an Empress based on whether she is getting to close or is cruelly manipulating. Another such turn can make your warrior into Death as she slaughters the enemy or Strength as she overcomes a stalwart foe. <br><br>   - Mendel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276560/#Comment_276560" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T08:28:58+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  8:28AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, <br><br>Dogs has always seemed to me a conflicted design (no pun intended) when it comes to how characters change. As it is, it makes me want an endgame, perhaps where your Dogs go back to Bridal Falls and confront the King of Life in a mega-conflict (the King of Life of course has d12 stat dice and d20 trait and relationship dice, and has a 3d20 relationship with all Dogs) - with the stakes being the doctrine of the faith. Sure, nothing else in the game but the experience fallout makes me think the Dogs are gearing up for a cataclysmic boss battle, but still. What I want is character change, not character advancement, and Dogs really falls short for that, and even more for it to be tied at the hip to the actions of the character. I want there to be something that says, you sharpshooted and killed that man so you will be raising your "Sharpshooter" trait, which do want to drop to pay for it: your "Hands that Heal" trait, your "Trust in the Faith" trait, or "Loving Family" Relationship. <br><br><br>Paul,<br><br/>I may have partially answered your question with John and Zac, but I'll try a little more. My perspective is that the best way to find what someone wants in play is to observe what they interact during play. System-wise, that means a game which ensure a player's actions during a game are recorded in such a way as to express the most important elements of the fiction to that player (or to the players as a whole) lets the player actually communicate what they want. It removes many of the social and introspective limits of declaring in advancing what you hope you will enjoy doing. In this case, you do what you enjoy, and if you don't enjoy it, you typically can change tact. In essence this is the power of empiricism over rhetoric. <br/><br/>In Artesia, the Arcana that a character accumulates will tend to be the most important elements of the game for that character and that player (although there will be a level of group and GM preference related as well). In one of my playtests, Homeworld Project, the rise and fall of the major elements of the game work in much the same way - individual character actions drive those elements either up or down, and those then feed back into the adversity.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276565/#Comment_276565" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T09:07:09+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  9:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>The only problem is that having a "locked-down" character is the most efficient build, in terms of effectiveness.

For instance, in a D&amp;D game where I'm most interested in political intrigue and/or romance, I may find the need to increase my fighting abilities (i.e. kill monsters) as much possible so as to make sure my character doesn't die before the romantic arc is resolved. If, say, character death is a constant threat, it's hard for me not to act towards that--but that's not necessarily representative of my goals or desires for the direction of the game.

In this sense, open-ended mechanical concerns like Dogs fallout work very well: by encouraging players to modify elements of [in this case, their characters] we have a very easy and clear way to communicate which way we want the game to go.

But in truth, this is as much a problem with Dogs in the Vineyards* as it is for D&amp;D - some traits and belongings will simply be more generally useful in conflicts than others, and in Dogs you want to be able to win conflicts almost regardless of your particular goals and desires. <br/><br/>I've been noticing that it may look like I'm knocking Dogs in the Vineyards here (and above). I'm really not trying to. It's just far from a game that I consider to encourage character identity to arise from character actions. Perhaps from the editorialization of those actions, but that isn't the same thing at all. <br/><br/>To my mind, the idea that actions speak louder than words should mean that if you want to communicate something it isn't enough to attach a metagame tag to your actions, you need to act toward a state in the game to achieve a new character state. In an odd way typical advancement systems have a very narrow version of this - if you want to become a more competent Dog be bad at talking and good at killing. Likewise, if you want to gain levels faster in D&amp;D learn to be good at earning XP, which for many, but not all, editions means learn to defeat the baddies efficiently and safely. Advancement systems tend to tell you how to clearly communicate competence through your actions - but not much else.<br/><br/>More general character change however has a wealth of uses by making something limited the player packages decisions to let part of her character go during the course of play. The provides a wide amount of nuance - because at once there is a sacrifice, a gain, and the current situation, and any one of those could be avowed reason. And perhaps the avowed reason is the only desire, but if you keep sacrificing something you "want" because the situations you get into "demand" it, then perhaps you should re-evaluate what it is you want or why you get into those situations. Likewise, if you really "want" something, the system tells you flat out how to get it, but you don't just get to spend a open slot on it, you need to seek out the moment in the fiction that gives it to you. Of course, part of the trick (in play, game design, and social contract design) of this is making sure that there aren't gatekeepers blocking your way, in the same way as a GM who has cast you into the lonely wilderness in Artesia is effectively blocking all sorts of social-themed Arcana. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276694/#Comment_276694" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T15:04:18+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  3:04PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>* How do you classify what is played into categories that accurately describe "importance to player"?</blockquote>\nThere seem to be two strategies for this. Either have them emerge (with annotations by players) over the course of play or have them pre-defined. Of course, the truth is that no matter how "pre-defined" you want things to be there will be some notional drift in the categories you use. That's good. As a designer you should exploit that to help make your game robust, rather than assume that your pre-defined categories will be inviolate. <br/><br/>Some quick examples: <br/><br/>Artesia's Arcana is a great example of pre-defined categories, but they are notably a bit cumbersome. <br/><br/>One of the sub-mechanics I use in Homeworld Project is Panache, your styles of being. You get two of these for your character out of a list of seven: Mystic, Noble, Pilot, Rake, Rogue, Tech, Warrior. You basically get a benefit doing something related to one (or both) of your Panache. You also can, once per chapter, use a Panache other than one of your two selected Panache, writing it down as a Panache vote, so called because once five votes are tallied, if there is a clear majority, that new Panache replaces one of your old ones. From one side this is a mechanic that offers you a way to change your Panache, and from the other it presents a risk to tapping into alternate Panache too regularly. <br/><br/>In my game Drift, players always have five total Focii (Cultural Truths and Technological Insights) while there is a list of these suggested, these can easily be invented on the fly. What helps make them more real is the addition of Babbles, which are short phrases or jargon that come up during their use, (yes like Technobabble). The Focii come and go frequently, limited by the local planet and the culture and technology of the character's ship. Over time, the characters have to choose between stagnation or giving up what remaining connection they have with their homes. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>* Who does the classifying?  If it's the game system (player = unreliable; GM = too much work), what's its formula for "X action = Y preference"?</blockquote>\nIn Artesia's Arcana, this is typically done by the GM, which takes some ramp up time, but is by no means as difficult as it first appears.<br/><br/>In the case of Panache votes, usually the other player involved in the bout will need to agree that the Panache vote is relevant to the situation. In practice that isn't terribly onerous. <br/><br/>In the case of Drift, I haven't explained how the actions turn into changes in the Focii. The method is essentially by characters expending additional effort during the mission. Every extra die of effort is a point of Drive that is recorded on that Truth or Insight. It makes that Focii more persistent and important, and increases the likelihood that one of the other Focii will be eliminated in its place. The clock for when a Focii is replaced comes from the actions without Truths or Insights, and from trying to heroically reduce the consequences of failing a mission conflict. Every part of that decision comes from the player, but the accounting is direct. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>* How is such data recorded, when every instant of play is a data point?</blockquote>\nThis is essentially a false premise. For your design's purposes, not every instant of play can or need be recorded. So you minimize the error, and the effort as best you can and as well suited as you can make to match the needs of your design. And you make that record serve multiple purposes. <br/><br/>I'm hoping that helps. If you'd like to delve some more into the subject, I suggest starting a thread over in praxis early next week, so I can devote some more time.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276713/#Comment_276713" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T17:26:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  5:26PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Thank you for sharing all that!

If I design my game correctly, the very fact that some players use "this skill more than that skill" is strong evidence that they prefer "playing scenes with deep interpersonal stakes" over "liking solving tough puzzles". But what a game record is going to extract is evidence, not perfect validation of a hypothesis. And don't forget that there is a massive domain of possible hypotheses - no amount of game recording, after the fact play re-writing (aka actual play reporting), or player interrogation is going to give you a definite answer. But it can narrow the scope, which can be enough for some purposes.<br/> <br/>The key distinction I make is between what is relevant to the dynamics of the game being designed, and what isn't. Certainly I can study player dynamics and try to reveal interests from a game agnostic angle (I've built an entire theory of RPGs to do just that). But if I'm building this into the game, I want to use my feedback as much as possible, rather than waste the effort of recording this particular trace of play.
