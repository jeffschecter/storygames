But you still will want something considerably lighter than the typical hacking/slashing sickles or leaf blades, for general positioning dominance. (I was a fencer--speed kills; especially rapid, "free" attacks to arms and legs.)<br/><br/>You're probably going have a basket-hilt, cross-guard, quillions, notches, and every other mod that lets you trap those shitty blades and snap them.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking we get you started with a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiavona#Schiavona" rel="nofollow">Schiavona</a>, maybe a main gauche for close-up work, though a handy buckler wouldn't go amiss against the ax-like hacking blades of Sumeria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389316/#Comment_389316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T11:04:56+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 11:04AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't gone farther downtime than the late Roman Republic, well outside your Bronze Age parameters, but I'd say David has it right.  The advantages of modern steel would come in the form of a lighter, longer, harder blade that can blow through the armor and weapons of the period.  A Schiavona or Scottish backsword with a basket hilt would do you well.  As a beneficiary of a modern diet and and medical care, you should also have a nontrivial edge in size and strength, which in tandem with your steel could make you a badass in melee or dueling encounters.<br/><br/>But practically speaking?  You're still going to have to worry about slings and arrows, not to mention spearcasts.  Don't get cocky.  A thrown German war ax at Idistavisus came within a few inches of splitting my skull in 16CE, even though I was wearing a modern helmet, steel breastplate, and camo.

I recall that the romans were intrigued to see non-combatants standing near the line ready to bend back into shape Gallic swords that had bent in combat. (Polybius 2.33) This implies that you might spend less time at this activity than your foes? (Although old Poly is not really believed by modern metallurgists)<br/><br/>OTOH that refers to long gallic swords more akin to Late Bronze age Sea People's weapons c1200 BC than your target epoch. Surely that period tends to  studded leather armour, large rectangular shields and bronze-tipped spears rather than swords? OTOH I recall that there are some guardsmen with axe-like weapons at that time.

Spear and shield is a vastly superior weapon system to single sword or sword and buckler. Swords are generally a backup or duelling weapon in most contexts anyway. <br/><br/>Regardless of how hard you sword is, you aren't cutting through any armour short of the thinnest gambeson and also not through a shield, buckler or even a bpiled leather vambrace. <br/><br/>You would have an advantage against a bronze sword in a duel. <br/><br/>If you go shortsword (around 35 inch blade) or even longsword (two handed weapon with a blade a bit longer) against a shield user you are toast unless the other guy really sucks. Even a buckler wielder is going to give you fits because he can cut off your direct line of counterattack as he strikes and bind easily after a parry.<br/><br/>(this last thing is a pet hate of mine)<br/><br/>Also, katanas are not all that useful except on the quick draw. They are not long enough to offer a secure defence. Also Japanese steel was really quite bad. Euro weapons and armour were superior due to better raw materials and the clash of vastly different cultures in battle creating an arms race.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389388/#Comment_389388" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T06:41:33+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  6:41AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a joke.

Even when we tested that out, namely that if the sword hit the spear it was destroyed, it rarely happened. Then people argue "But if you're in close combat you'd rather have a sword." Again, the answer is, probably not. There are ways of handling a spear that make it perfectly useable in tight quarters.<br/>\n<blockquote>Regardless of how hard you sword is, you aren't cutting through any armour short of the thinnest gambeson and also not through a shield, buckler or even a bpiled leather vambrace. </blockquote> On that, I'd have to disagree. Maybe you wouldn't chop through in one swing but the hardness would make it much more likely to break a shield than a bronze sword. Piercing armor with the tip is much more likely with steel also.<br/><br/>At the end of the bronze age, iron weapons made a huge difference. A nation that could make iron blades was feared.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389393/#Comment_389393" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T07:12:19+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  7:12AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, does your method of time travel have sufficient radiation shielding?

The fact that they're lighter and can be moved far faster than a heavy bronze or iron sword means they can strike very quickly with a lot of power. You're also using different muscle groups and you can put your body weight behind your strikes more easily instead of just relying on the weapon's mass to strike.<br/><br/>But it's mostly the reach and the speed. Add that to the ability to throw it. . .<br/><br/>If you want to try it out, I suggest this. Get a length of 1" or 3/4" PVC pipe. Cut it to about your hight and wrap the end with a generous amount of foam. Try it out. It's fun and will only take a few minutes to make. The spearmen will be able to strike long before the sword can come into play and be out of the way before the sword can even connect with it.<br/><br/>The only thing that really killed the spear is the gun. And then they made the gun into a spear by putting a bayonet on it. I can't argue with the effectiveness of a spear that can shoot a round or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389451/#Comment_389451" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T14:50:48+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  2:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The only time I did anything like a boffer style larp, I went with spear and back up short blade, mostly because I had no idea what I was doing.<br/><br/>Even being totally inexperienced, i'd still get 4-5 good pokes in on opponents armed wth things like swords and axes, whether or not they had shields, before they'd get a hit in.<br/><br/>I suspect a spear is just a really a weapon that has a really obvious method of use/technique compared to a sword.</blockquote>\nAnd I suspect that nobody had any idea what they were doing with sword and shield.

With sufficiently large shields the sword wielder is mostly going to be thrusting anyway. A spear can be used to kill the guy to your right and 1 rank back as well as someone close by changing the position of you hand on the shaft.<br/><br/>As for cutting through shields, this is not happening either. You will either bounce off the rim or get stuck in the shield. Being stuck= bad.<br/><br/>Cutting through armour, no. Thrusting? Yes! <br/><br/>For a good look at shield fighting, google Talhoffer. (ignore the whacky companion weapons) you will see that the shield is not used to parry but to open and close lines.

I'm just expressing what I know to be the case, you're doing the same.<br/><br/>By way of an explanation, I just meant that if I go up against a sword with a spear and loose, that means to me that professional soldiers from hundreds of years ago knew more about how to fight with a spear than I do (which is totally true).<br/><br/>The vid shows the problem. Historically spears were only as long as you are tall. What he's trying to use is more like a lance or a halberd length. Usually soldiers would have a spear and a shield, there's no way I could use a spear that long and still carry a spear. Maybe thats why it wasn't going right for the guys you went up against? Think about the Romans. A huge shield, a javelin, a spear, and a sword. They would probably be used in that order (maybe swap the javelin and the shield dependent on the circumstances).<br/><br/>Again, not picking a fight, just trying to share.

It didn't occur to me that you were talking hoplite spear &amp; shield. I guess that's where our break in communication was. I never thought you were picking a fight, only disagreeing with me.
