                    While reading <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=112&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">The Inevitable Tabletop Vs. LARP Question</a>, I had this thought for a simple Narrativist-style LARP resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>Players create their characters by writing traits on cards. Any trait they want. They can write the same trait on more than one card if that trait is especially important to them. During play, any conflict between players is resolved by playing a relevant card, role-playing appropriately, and tearing the card in half (thus it cannot be used again). Each card is worth 1 point. Most points wins.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players are given cards in three different colors, which represent 1-point, 2-point, and 3-point traits.  Each player gets the same number of cards of each color, and more 1-point cards than 2-point cards, and more 2-point cards than 3-point cards.<br/><br/>Whenever a player loses a conflict, he gets 2 points with which to purchase more traits for the next LARP session.                </div>

                            you just described the system for the Cyberpunk LARPs run across the US by Gilbert Milner and I throughout the nineties. We didn't use points, we used multiple cards. Interesting point, several of the players from Japan asked if they could show others their cards without using them (like weapons and sex appeal) we said yes and  it created a whole social dynamic around revealing your cards.                        </div>

                            That's pretty solid.  Lot's of interesting variations that could be applied, especially in terms of custom effect cards for a specific plot.                        </div>

                            I envision being able to burn as many cards as you want, if it's worth it to you. If you got no cards left to burn, too bad -- you lose (and earn points for new cards later).<br/><br/>My wife Steph and I use a simple card system for our Firan-based LARP that we run every year (60-70 people last year). It's a one-shot, four hour thing. Each character gets a bunch of cards that represent cool things they can do. It's essentially task resolution (one card = one thing they do) and it's essentially a trump card.<br/><br/>This is an extension of that, so players 1) write their own cards, 2) aren't limiting cards to task-oriented crap (you could write "hopelessly sad" and use it in a conflict), 3) can use use as many as they want per conflict, probably one at a time, back and forth.<br/><code><br/>Alex: "I won't tell you where the secret base is! Never!"<br/>Bob: "Ve haff vays of making you talk!"<br/>Alex: "You'll never break me!"<br/>Bob: I use my mental powers to convince you to talk.<br/>Bob tears his "mental powers" trait card in half. Bob is up by 1.<br/>Alex holds his head as if in agony.<br/>Alex: "Too... much... must... resist... can't betray... friends..."<br/>Alex rips his "Loyal to friends" card in half. Score is 1-1.<br/>Bob shows a 2-point "Interrogator" card and tears it.<br/>Bob: Your body is wracked with pain as my brain takes over your nervous system and fries it. Zap! Zap!<br/>Score is 3-1. Alex looks at his cards and decides not to burn any more.<br/>Alex: "All right! Please! Stop! The base is in Budapest!"<br/>Alex takes 2 points to earn cards later. Maybe even 4 points, since he lost by 2.<br/></code> </div>

                            You could definitely build a game around that.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't call the mechanic "Nar-style" -- there's nothing in it that particularly encourages players to address a Premise. Players could fill their cards with guns and kung-fu and other such Challenge-addressing traits instead.<br/>
<br/>
What happens with ties?<br/>
<br/>
What happens when a new player comes into a game where most people have been building up points for a long time already? Can the new player help but get stomped on by everyone else?<br/>
<br/>
A game built around this mechanic -- like any game with freeform Traits -- also needs guidelines around how "broad" those traits can be. You don't want players stocking up on "Jack of All Trades" cards.<br/>

                            Hmm. I'd keep it as is for a high-trust game.  Most of the games I'd use this for are ones where I;m not as worried about some of the potential abuses.  Self-selection and all that.<br/>
<br/>
One way to "balance" cards created without oversite would be to say in advance there are, say, a fixed list of types of conflict (Say, Physical, Social and Magical).  When you write something down on a card, you also note at the bottom what sort of conflict it's useful for. (So Sword: Physical)<br/>
<br/>
You could have a point based model where the point value of a card is how many _types_ of conflicts it can be use for (so Spellcutter, a magical sword: Physical/Magical costs 2 points).  However it's handled, the cards are purely mechanical and the description is pure color.<br/>
<br/>
Ties are pretty easy to handle (tie == losing - i.e. what you want to happen does not). I had some fancier ideas, but you really want it to be that simple, because the real dynamic shouldn't be "how many cards do you _have_?" it should be "how many cards are you _willing to spend_?".<br/>
<br/>
I'd be leery of using this for any long-term sort of thing.  I'd  want cards to replenish over the course of a game (from defeats) but for card pool sizes to not change much.  For soemthign mor elong term, I'd be tempted to crunch it up a bit.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I might also want some way to standardize defeats.  Partly to prevent abuses, but partly because I think it could get folded into things well.<br/>
<br/>
So, for a longer term game, it strikes me that the thing that could really make a game like this is a laminator.  A Laminated card can be used, but not used up.  Thus, at the beginning of a conflict, you try to use laminated cards first since you "get them back" and only one onto expendable resources when you have to.   This is a good way to model more potent characters without just giving them more cards, but it also introduces some other hooks, such as adding special rules to specific laminated cards.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually the part where I am especially intrigued because, in my mind, the best part would be making sure cards are a _mix_ of player created and GM-created cards.  GM created cards give players bits of setting and potentially motives and the like right out the gate, and can tie them into whatever the plot may be, while still leaving some player freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, depending on the scope of the game, cards as a sort of currency has a lot lot lot of appeal.  Imagine if, in a political game, having a laminiated card meant you owned a resource (say the church) and that gave you the ability to give other players "Church support" cards, within certain bounds.  That gives political power a real currency to play with, and at the same time makes any way of seizing control of that laminated card really appealing to anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Gah. Dammit. this is going to sit in my brain until I write it now. Damn you Adam.<br/>

                            You could also make it like in TSoY, where each character, or maybe each stat, or something, has a refresh thingie. Go do that thingie, and have a moderator witness it, and you get cards back. But make the refresh thingie involve other players, never a 'go off on my own for ten minutes). That was the most divisive thing at the only LARP I ever played. And the most abused.<br/><br/>E.G.: You get back your Fury when you can make someone calm lash out at you.                        </div>

Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Man, you could do the refresh thing with everyone having a chop or stamp or something.  You can have a refresh card (fury , say) and you _can_ use it normally or, after a conflict, you could get the other players in the scene to stamp/punch it, and when you turn it in, stamps turn into refresh.<br/>
<br/>
Probably immersion-breaking, but kind of fun to think about.  Hnh. Actually, for a Skyrealms of Jorune game you could _totally_ do it in character! Man, that alone is tempting.<br/>

PS - For those who don't know it, SoJ has one of the best rationales for adventuring ever - it's how you become a citizen.  You apply, and they give you two plaques - you hang one in the capitol and take one with you.  Whenever a citizen is impressed with you, they put their chop on your plaque (or if they're _really_ impressed, they travel to the capitol, and put their chop on your plaque there). At the end, the chops are tallied and used as a basis for whether or not you become a citizen.                        </div>

                            Also, I note, for about a buck at staples, you can get decent cases for holding 24 business cards or so.  I've used them for non-ripping card-based games before, and they work pretty well. Wouldn't be hard to use them for this either.<br/>
