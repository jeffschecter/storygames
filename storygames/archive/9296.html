I believe there is a trap hidden in the use of "fair/unfair" as a principle for rpgs. Problem with "fair" on one level, is that it lets the players be <i>sympathetic </i>with their characters. In my view "sympathy" with your character is contrary to playing it effectively. Let me try to explain:<br/><br/>---&gt; A player filled with <i><b>sympathy </b></i>will object to any sad happening his character may experience, and make it an action against himself. Such a player internalize the character, and becomes a moaning player-character mesh. In a game full of such players, the GM is left with too thin a line to balance on. The typical game of this type gives the players full ownership over their characters, with no recompense for the loss of fiction-power. The GM is the arbiter of <i>fiction-power over the character</i> in this kind of games, and is too often left to fly with stunted wings. I do not support that kind of muddled engagement and stunted GM-position.<br/><br/>---&gt; I prefer the kind of player-engagement based on <i><b>empathy</b></i>; to see your character as an interwoven part of the fiction, and trying your best to work in his interest under the conditions given, while accepting his destiny. This opens up for a much more challenging player-stance, and gives the <i>fiction </i>full sovereignty over the destiny of the character. It also frees the GM in regards to what she may present as consequences for the characters, and that is quite important in classical role-playing games. Believable and varied consequences carries the day any time, in these kind of games. It makes way for the kind of drama that sweeps the players off their feet and throw them headlong into fictions too complex to be controlled by their characters.<br/><br/><i>I know this sounds like rules set in stone, but I am really only thinking aloud here. So please step in with your own thoughts on it.</i><br/><br/><b>Nota bene:</b><br/>My thinking rest on the difference between sympathy and empathy:<br/>- Sympathy = to feel what others feel, and help them.<br/>- Empathy = too see what others feel, and help them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205863/#Comment_205863" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T01:30:45+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  1:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you added that <b>Nota bene</b>, because my understanding of the terms sympathy and empathy has the definitions reversed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205884/#Comment_205884" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T05:02:16+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  5:02AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah i also would've put them the other way around.

A lot of players, and GMs, refrain from certain kinds of hurt by this reason, believing that this will leave them free to produce great game-play. However; the "full ownership"-stance will limit the potential, and often leave them with unfun solutions to interesting situations. Players desperately clinging to their characters are not conductive to great role-playing.<br/><br/>My take on this is to communicate what kind of engagement I expect from players in my games, and what it implies. Anyone prone to "full ownership" is kindly guided into the more functional "helper of character"-stance. And then we proceed to create as much fun as any other rpg can hold, and then some. The "reformed" players regularly come out of the game-session feeling elated. Even old-timers tend to be enthusiastic: "Blast! That was great! Haven't had such fun since the early days of rpgs!"<br/><br/>There are still pit-falls for the GM to blunder into (over-ruling, bad consequences, lack of communication, etc.), but the overall potential for great interaction and fiction is strengthened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_205929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205929/#Comment_205929" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:49:20+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 6:50AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #660033;"><i>SIDENOTE: Simon; the distinction between these two stances is quite important, and not only in games; in real life too.

Such attacks are labeled "unfair". Even "fair" attacks my leave such a player hurt on behalf of his character. If the character is hurt, the sympathetic player also feels hurt. This makes for quarrelsome players.<br/><br/>If the character is hurt, the empathic player is likely to play along, taking the effect of such a hurt into consideration in his future interpretation of the character. It makes for players that are fully focused on playing along and contributing to the fiction, while augmenting their character with the effects of the powers at play. This paves the way for seamless and highly believable fictions of great wonder.<br/><br/>The characters are the pivotal element of classical rpgs, so how we relate to them is of great importance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205934/#Comment_205934" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T06:51:56+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  6:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 6:54AM by PaulCzege.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Pity</b> - I can tell that he is suffering.

I can attest to the fact that LARP play lends itself MUCH more to sympathizing players, probably due to the high degree of immersion into their characters and how rarely folks portray "unheroic" or negative attitudes ("I am playing my personal ideal; you insult that ideal, you insult ME!"). Contrast that with, say, a character you make in Universalis--everyone can take control of said character and do all sorts of things, some far worse than hurting them (e.g. making them do vile things for their own benefit: it "helps" the character but puts a very unsympathetic light on it). Even if I instantiated that character, I have no ownership and, by rights, I should not be hurt no matter what happens to it.<br/><br/>So, hmmm.... I'd say that playing from a sympathizing perspective is badwrongfun, in almost all games. Let's consider it as a continuum:<br/>* I play MageKnight. My army is one legend and a couple of his cronies. Your army houses mine, because of the inherent benefit of multiple pieces in MK's turn structure. If I get bent out of shape, I've broken the social contract--we agreed to "fight to the death," my guys died... OK, no crying, new game.<br/>* I play D&amp;D. My guy is a fully formed character with (at the least) a tactical role in a game about killing things and taking their stuff. My guy gets killed by a monster with a level-appropriate CR. OK, solve that complication (resurrect) or make a new guy. Again, no crying--you took your shot, you were found wanting, become better.<br/>* I play For Mature Audience. My guy is a stylized representation of what I want to be (me, the real person, in real life) but is Scarred with dysfunctions that I want to resolve. The other players push at those dysfunctions, tease them, put me into situations where I must portray extremely unfavorable and hurtful attitudes and actions that come from my dysfunctions. Can't get more sympathizing than that--but still no crying. OK, the tears might flow... maybe I should have been writing "no bitching." The game is made to push you to the edge and a bit beyond, and all that pressure from other players is ANTITHETICAL to being actually hurtful. You get hurt, but everyone stays engaged so that no one is abandoned in their self-reflection and self-loathing. They are trying to hurt you, through your weaknesses, to purge said weaknesses.<br/><br/>The more I think on this as I'm typing, the more I think that sympathizing with a character is just nuts, pure and simple.

Must be nice to have such a psychic conduit to the 300-500 million English speakers of the world. That should be the Czege Principle: "I know the mass consciousness, and common usage trumps authoritative definitions, even in semantic debates." And, whoa, it's official! Wikipedia now is more authoritative than OED! Or Merriam-Webster! *rollseyes*<br/><br/>I was taught a simple distinction between sympathy and empathy, back in the benighted, pre-Wikipedia days of college: You can sympathize with someone if you've shared, in part or in toto, their experience; you can only empathize with someone when you haven't actually lived through a similar emotionally charged situation. I can sympathize with aggrieved English majors who waste too much time online correcting lazy semantics; but I can only empathize with people who insist upon using personal definitions of terms in public debate, in spite of several authorities speaking to the contrary.<br/><br/>Anything to contribute about blarg play versus fargle play? No? OK, thanks for sharing.<br/>-----<br/>Thomas, I suspect that a lot of the Norwegian LARP scene involves either pre-generated characters or at least strong R-maps and/or character traits, right? In addition, the Scandinavian LARP scene seems to push at more "LARP as art" and, thus, drives towards play which crosses Lines or pushes for a strong theme or tone. Contrast that with most US LARPs (I've seen) which give 90% of the character generation duties to the players, and which have a strong notion of "character monogamy" (to borrow a Morningstarism--I read it as "I am the only one who can fuck my character!"). <br/><br/>And I reckon that's sort of what I was getting at with the Universalis example: there's no protagonist protection of a character inherent in the system (other than the weight of Facts as it relates to removing the character from the story).<br/><br/>But other systems bend over backwards to give players near-total agency over what their characters experience. I've even go so far as to codify that in GLASS (generic LARP rules) by expressly excluding anything like "mind control" or seduction or the like: there's too much internalization of character, in the types of LARPs it's designed to run, and thus too much risk of unfun experiences (not to mention abuse). Somehow, the abstraction or remove of sitting at a table reduces the unfunness of "character polygamy". IMAGINING another PC seducing your PC is one thing; ACTING through it (and its consequences) in a LARP context is quite another.<br/><br/>And I take it even a step further, with one of the game Toggles (Player Priority)--you can't even DIE unless you choose to expose yourself to that risk (for an immediate mechanical reward). Even the most "nerfed" boffer LARPs out there don't go so far as that, typically.<br/><br/>But all that said, and even in conflict with my own previous point... I feel that there must be a "good" way to do sympathizing character embodiment that's not "role playing" like they do in psychiatry/psychotherapy. I think it would take a game, however, in which everyone is equally exposed. No GMs sitting back and watching you squirm as they roll out NPCs with whom they aren't even empathic, let alone sympathetic. No "quiet players" sitting on the side, nor turtling players. If everyone's balls are on the table to be hit with a hammer, you'd get a check and balance sort of thing going on... hmmm... which might actually REDUCE sympathetic play, as folks find a least common denominator of personal risk from sympathetic play.

And I feel his suffering as my own suffering.</blockquote>does not really jive with this:<blockquote><cite>Wikipedia on Empathy</cite>Empathy is the capability to share your feelings and understand another's emotion and feelings. It is often characterized as the ability to "put oneself into another's shoes," or in some way experience what the other person is feeling. Empathy does not necessarily imply compassion, sympathy, or empathic concern because this capacity can be present in context of compassionate or cruel behavior.</blockquote>feeling "his suffering as my own suffering" seems to imply compassion, whereas your quote from Wikipedia says quite clearly that empathy does <i>not</i> imply compassion.  This seems to make it jive more with Tomas's definition of it which describes empathy as a close <i>understanding</i> of what someone else is feeling.<br/><br/>Also, for what it's worth, I'm American, born and raised and still living in Iowa, and my understanding of the two terms is and was closer to the definitions Tomas quoted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206092/#Comment_206092" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T12:38:55+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 12:38PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the news today David Artman has won the internet.

It is clearly a long way from Scandinavian larping, yes, and your notion of how it differs is on the mark; yes, Norwegian larps is very much about relationships and player driven intrigues. The character-building is done by the organizers, in cooperation with the players, but still. The game-play itself is for the most part driven by the players, and focus a lot on relationships and group-play.<br/><br/>I believe there is good ways to sympathize with character. It is another discussion, but still; most of my "sympathetic embodiment" has taken place in games too radical for the average player. Have played experimental games toying with the boundaries between player and character. It is interesting, but tend to be mentally challenging when it is at its best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206104/#Comment_206104" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T13:09:13+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  1:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not optimistic about where this thread is headed, but I'll throw in a suggestion about where a new one might start.<br/><br/>I think this can be phrased in terms of "I am" versus "I have".

You can also prefer using a mechanical pencil to a wooden one, and be consciously aware of that preference and strive to use the one you like and avoid the one you don't.  It would improve your real-life experience at the gaming table, but it wouldn't be the most important choice you made there and if someone launched a "mechanical versus wooden" debate and talked about how wooden pencils interrupt game flow by needing to be sharpened periodically or breaking at inopportune moments and are therefore anathema but using mechanical pencils is virtuous and indicative of your deep concern for good pacing...well, that would be an obviously silly and oversimplified argument.<br/><br/>And that's sort of where I'm at with sympathy versus empathy.  I don't think any real person is all on one side or all on the other.  I think people can prefer to land more on one side than the other, sure, and I think that preference is a nice thing for them to be aware of, and while it's more useful than knowing your preference in pencil technology, it's still not the most important thing to know.<br/><br/>I'm cool with this debate being about a small insight into a tiny smear in the giant blur of what goes on in peoples' heads.  It means it's not as useful as the portentous verbiage about the wonders of playing with empathy and banishing sympathy to the far side of the moon wants to make it sound, but that's fine.  If I didn't like exaggeration for effect, I would've fled the internet years and years and years ago.  It doesn't have to be useful for me to keep reading it, although if it did move in that direction I certainly wouldn't complain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206107/#Comment_206107" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T13:24:34+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  1:24PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 1:30PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I have had players that objected to bad things happening to their characters because they felt watching a character get hurt detracted from their fun, and others who threw characters into terrible situations because playing out those situations and the repercussions was part of the fun.</blockquote>I have seen this too.<br/><br/>There is a way of meeting this; I tell the players to do their best for their characters, and then I inform that no player have a free-pass from conflicts that may influence any real person directly (in a bad of good way).  expect them to play their characters whatever happen to them, good stuff AND bad. I do not want players to make bad choices for their characters. When the GM is given the right to shower them with any and all believable consequences, the conflicts of the fiction will tend to threaten the characters, and make the fight for their salvation enough for the most gifted player.<br/><br/>The freedom of the GM, and her creative powers, is better facilitated in games where the player tries to see the full depth of his character, while at the same time understanding that the character is not only "his"; it is an independent entity "owned" by the larger fiction too. When the die or the twists of fate decrees it; the player must be ready to portray his character as a tragic figure, to be true to the fiction. This is indeed quite as interesting and entertaining as portraying the hero.<br/><br/>I want to underline that fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I expect players of classical role-playing games to help their characters as much as they can</span>, even when adopting the empathic stance I am holding up as an ideal here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206116/#Comment_206116" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T13:45:18+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  1:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>I wonder how much the preference for one style of play over the other is affected by game mechanics which can cause a player to be "frozen out" of play for a period of time.<br/><br/>Using old-timey B/X D&amp;D as an example, I've seen players be much more on the Empathy side of things with their low-level ( like first or second level) characters, and swing much more towards the Sympathy side of things as the character went up in level.<br/><br/>I don't think it's an accident. Rolling up a new first or second level character is dead simple. A higher level character, not so much. If something bad (like death) happens to that low-level character, the player isn't frozen out of the game participation for any great length of time. With a higher level character, they may be frozen out of play for quite a long time, and that may even have a collateral freezing-out effect on other players if the GM has to drop the game to aid in the creation of the new character.<br/><br/>Once you get beyond simple hack'n'slash of early rpgs into the "big characterization" period of stuff like the oWoD games, "freeze-outs" are even lengthier, due not just to a lengthier mechanical character creation process, but also due to a culture where there is a high regard for pre-introduction character backstory creation.<br/><br/>In other words, losing your Caitiff neonate or werewolf cub may freeze you, the player, out of the game for an entire evening.<br/><br/>I would contrast that with many dirty-hippy games, which tend to dodge player "freeze-outs" through various means, of which common or semi-common ownership of fictional bits (including characters) is a striking example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206130/#Comment_206130" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T14:30:55+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  2:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tomas,<br/><br/>Let's say there's two types of characters players create.

(Hmm, and that brings up the notion of randomness as deprotagonization... but that... is another thread.)</blockquote>Return of investment and randomness as deprotagonization ... hmm ...<br/><br/><b>Return of investment</b> is certainly an issue here. In my current twin-campaign, with 18 year old boys, I have stated that no character may be killed until the final showdown. The two groups have played their characters for 90-120 sessions, and have been invested with each their part in the world-saving plot of the high fantasy fiction. It is too heavy a break of genre-conventions to have any of the heroes die, so they will stay alive. However; I have also stated that I feel completely free to maim and manipulate the characters in any conceivable way.<br/><br/>I expect my players to play it out, whatever happen to their characters, and they try their best. But none of them has empathy as the great leading star in their everyday life. Most of them are rather sympathetic in relation to personal and political challenges. Still; by being very clear on this point in the game, I get a more detached stance from them in-game. With clear guidance it is possible to do this for any man of normal faculties.<br/><br/>In any normal game, though, with an amateur GM (I've been a professional GM for 14 years), the "return of investment" will influence the players, and make them sympathize strongly with their character as it goes up level after level. It is natural in a campaign-game. So; even though I am holding up empathy as an ideal foundation for the player-stance, I have to concede that players tend to sympathize, and that if would be very strange if they did not. We all get really irked by having our grand character killed.<br/><br/>This, however, is not the same as being irked by our character experiencing adverse conditions, and having problems coping in certain situations. It is still possible for us to accept these elements of the game, and play our character in "bad conditions". It makes for better and more fun play, if we accept it and make the most of it. And that is all about seeing your character, acknowledging the feelings he may have, and exploring the effects. A detached, but still engaged, way of playing, and a way far better suited to the essence of role-playing games.<br/><br/>This way of playing is possible, of course, and may be supported by good instructions in the game, and by kind and clear GMs.<br/><br/><b>Randomness of deprotagonization</b> is another issue here. The word <i>deprotagonization </i>(misspelt here) is an ugly one; a demon conjured whenever something is threatening the character-autonomy. I do not like it one bit. The dualistic thinking of <i>protagonist </i>and <i>antagonist </i>is contrary to dynamic flow in an interactive narrative. It weakens the potency of any interactive method. It may be an interesting and useful pair of terms in relation to storytelling or novels, but in the interactive art of role-playing games it is lacking in true relevance, to the degree of being destructive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206226/#Comment_206226" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T00:20:08+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 12:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2009 12:21AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>So I guess this is all gyrating to the point that sympathetic play is, in fact, OK--might even be a sort of default, especially for newer players (!)--but one must remain "above the game" somewhat, out of a sense of fairness, trust in (and agreement to play by) the system, social contract to accept the consequences of the risk/reward structures in the game, and service to interesting stories.

But I consider classical rpgs to be more than a bunch of mechanics (I prefer the term <i>method </i>on how we play and what elements we play with); so I consider your take on it to be too narrow. As we have discussed already, there are elements in classical games that supports a sympathetic stance, and elements that supports an empathic stance. I prefer to have this disclosed, for GMs and players (and game-smiths) too make informed choices on how to game.<br/><br/>And I do believe that classical games are better off with empathic players too.

"Failure rewards." Gotta keep that on a post-it note over my writing PC. ;^)<br/><br/>One brief clarification: <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Deprotagonization" rel="nofollow">Deprotagonization</a> (not an officially defined word, so it shows as misspelled) is not synonymous with "being made antagonist". Yes, protags and antags are opposites in a literary sense, but deprotag'ing someone in a game context means what the RPG.net wiki says: putting a player character into a backseat, be it with railroad plots, "more important" NPCs, or injecting words or action into them without player consent. And BAM, that's going to feel unfair, and BAM that's going to make someone--either empathetic OR sympathetic--get pissed. (Unless the game is precisely ABOUT such undermining, in which case you signed up for it: no bitching.)<br/><br/>And I said "randomness AS deprotagonization", which could be exemplified by the "save versus death or die" class of rolls, or the kobold with the natural 20. It places the system mechanics and/or the "reality" of the game world above the protagonist nature of (traditional) PCs. Luke Skywalker's head wasn't stove in by the Tuskan Raider because he's the HERO, and so he HAS to survive an assault by presumably murderous creatures using ugly, heavy, mace-like objects. Ever been hit by a real mace while unarmored? (Answer, by default, must be "No"... or you're undead or something.) So the "needs of the story"--Luke as protagonist--overrode the "reality" that getting brained with a mace-like staff generally leaves bits of bone and neural matter spread across the desert sand. And, hey, apparently Storm Troopers CAN shoot the shit out of folks... as long as they're NPCs like the defenders on Leia's ship or Uncle Ben and Aunt Veru.<br/><br/>(So much for "brief.")<br/><br/>I'm not sure, however, that this notion is appropriate for this thread which is teasing out appropriate or desirable "degrees of equation" between a player and their character, for various game agendas. It's related, but only orthogonally (as I said above: deprotag someone, and it almost doesn't matter what their degree of equation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206265/#Comment_206265" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T08:56:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  8:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not entirely sure I'm familiar with "failure rewards". <br/><br/>Could anyone give me an example?<br/><br/>Or, perhaps I'm just more familiar with ad-hoc, socially derived,failure rewards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206270/#Comment_206270" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T09:07:16+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  9:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couldnt you use "sympathetic" player-character relationships to give players a joyful experience just like you could give them a more "hurtful" experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206272/#Comment_206272" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T09:12:48+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  9:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "This is interesting.

These emo freaks (JK) want to wallow in the suffering, seek a cathartic experience; and so taking away adversity or having a hippie love-fest stroke-off won't push their buttons. And they'll get complain about that, get pissy, weakly slap you on the upper arms, and go back to their charming, Ikea-decorated loft, taking their bruschetta with them.<br/><br/>But, no really, even more seriously, I'd expect folks who play from the "total identification and immersion" stance of extreme sympathy would argue that such rewards--the joyous success of a plan come together and a damsel's heart won--are what make up for the shitty stuff, it's the reason they suffer the shitty stuff at all. In fact, hey! That could be a GM's best defense against overly sympathetic players that bitch and moan:<br/>"Well, look at it this way--this adversity, this setback, this vestigial nipple on your forearm (TRUE plot from Star Trek, folks--look it up!)--will just make your eventual victory all the sweeter, no? Would you just want to flounce through the adventure, knocking over all enemies with silent-but-violent farts or witty repartee, to get the prize handed to you on a silver platter? That would be lame, right? SO QUIT YOUR BITCHING, YOU NANCY BOY!"<br/><br/>Maybe not the last bit. But the general argument is strong: pain heals, chicks dig scars, and glory lasts forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206291/#Comment_206291" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T10:14:19+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 10:14AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that the main problems being attributed to sympathetic play are problems of failing to distinguish between levels.  i.e. If I am playing sympathetically and my character is wounded by an orc, then supposedly I will get mad at the GM for wounding me.  <br/><br/>I'd agree that the above would be a problem, but in my experience it isn't a necessary or even common part of what I call more sympathetic play.  Conversely, there are plenty of players who are not sympathetic in the sense of getting inside their character's head, but who still don't want the downer of having their character be wounded or lose much.  <br/><br/>In my experience, players that are classified as "character actors" or "characters immersive" (by themselves and/or others) frequently thrive on having their character be in harsh conditions - wounded, threatened, etc.  I think the line that they prefer to not cross is having their character taken out of play -- i.e. killed in the extreme, but to a lesser extent knocked unconscious and dragged around, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206308/#Comment_206308" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T11:09:55+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 11:09AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2009 11:12AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In the more extreme circumstances I've seen, combat is acceptable, but player-character death is not.

As a general stance, though, it is a high-risk position, fraught with pit-falls that makes playing a lot more difficult and non-rewarding than it have to be.<br/><br/>It is possible to negate the risks though, and it is indeed used in a lot of classical game-play, while alleviated by "rules" on what you have to accept being done to your character anyway. Used this way the sympathy-drive is an opening towards character-immersion, and let players experience the wonders of "being someone else".<br/><br/>My point is that this is easily done with an empathic stance too, to the same effect, and with much less risk of ruining the game-play, and a far greater awareness of how to feed your character-immersion into fruitful interaction with the fiction, and the other players. So I aim at finding the keys to unlock this stance in the average gamer.

Help is appreciated!</blockquote>\nI thought you were already on top of that with what you do in your own gaming groups.  You said you push for the empathy-centered play you like, and push away from sympathy-centered play, and you play with people who are of a similar mindset (or can be convinced to try what you enjoy, and that you've been successful in getting them to enjoy it as well).  If there's something more you can do to get the gaming you want out of the people you play with short of forcible indoctrination, drug therapy, or surgery, I don't know what it would be.<br/><br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you're talking about convincing "the average gamer" in a global, change-the-world kind of way, well, I'm not sure there are any options you've missed there, either.  You can advocate for the empathy-centered style of gaming you prefer, you can write books and forum posts and games that promote it, and you can hope that somewhere out in the teeming sea of gamers your ideas will catch hold.  Dare to dream, I guess.  (Or at least take heart in knowing that by promoting the games you like in your own neighborhood, you get better gaming for yourself....and that however people are playing half a world away has absolutely no real effect on you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206363/#Comment_206363" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T13:33:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  1:33PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>the widening divide between GMs and non-GM players...</blockquote>A really interesting thing you touch upon here ...<br/><br/>Accounting: I do it, yes, but I am constantly trying to put what I do into words and/or instructions.

interesting thing you touch upon here ...<br/><br/>Admittedly, that's mostly a personal perception of the development of things.<br/><br/>I played mostly TSR boxed games as a kid in the 80s, and watched the growth of the "Big Book" model through the late-80s-90s. Those old Boxed games all clocked in at around 64 pages or so for rules. It was simply much easier for everyone to learn to GM a system or two if they had any inclination towards GMing at all.<br/><br/>( The very obvious early exception being the AD&amp;D books. But hey- that was <i>Advanced</i> D&amp;D! ;-) )<br/><br/>The more the Big Book model came into play, it seems like the bigger the divide between GM skills/duties and player skills/duties became.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206392/#Comment_206392" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T15:45:06+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  3:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right.

I feel it may present some extra insights, perchance something that can be useful in a non-game environment too. And more; I am at a loss how to un-write this thread ... ;-)<br/><br/>I am "polarizing" the terms in relation to most real game-play, yes, but that is to make a point out of their difference. In any normal game you will find both, but the tendency of the players to choose one stance over the other, and their decision of when to switch between them, have great impact on the game-play. By choosing the sympathetic approach players can march happily into a social catastrophe. They don't have to, but the pit-falls of sympathy is so close at hand and many, so it is very likely that tension get so high over in-game events that the game is ruined.<br/><br/>We are all human, so we are prone to making "human errors". And in my experience we do make those errors, each and every day. But then we correct them by choosing anew; by saying we are sorry, by acknowledging the divide between my feelings and yours, and acting on it, or by trying another approach to patch it up. The thing is that we don't always get the chance to correct our mistakes, due to other humans being hurt and alienated towards us.<br/><br/>I believe that role-playing games are serious play on some levels, and as such they should be played with extra care and consideration for fellow players. To investigate emotions and conditions in "realistic" characters is at best a beautiful experience, fraught with insights on how to be another human. At worst it is an experience of engagements gone awry, with real relations suffering as a consequence.<br/><br/>To avoid the "engagements gone awry", I believe a clear understanding of the difference between sympathy and empathy can help us. By choosing an empathic approach rather than a sympathetic one, we give ourselves a much better chance of making great games and great friends out of it. It is very nice to dive into a character and "walk in his shoes", but we don't have to forget how we interact the best with our fellow players while doing it.<br/><br/>We may choose wisely in this as players, and I believe game-smiths will be wise taking it into consideration when writing their games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206475/#Comment_206475" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T09:13:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  9:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            not really touching on the sympathy/empathy thing, I find the idea of serious play a little interesting. <br/><br/>Play for children is all about trying out stuff and learning the appropiate social norms that go with them. Its appropiate for the copper to shoot the robbers , its appropiate when shot to drop dead, and then appropiate to feel sad over the dead person. I don't see that changing terribly for adults. Adults by virtue of an extra 5, 10, 15 , 20 years etc have already learned alot (especially about when it is appropiate for your dude to fall over ) but when we are acting badly (not appropiately) is when we are actually learning again (we're getting non positive feedback over our actions leading to change. ). Playing with extra care and consideration is a laudible goal but if it prevents the learning the is arguably the goal of play then its actually undermining play by not showing (never teaching) people where the appropiate/not appropiate boundries are.<br/><br/>On a side note, I hate author stance, AND IM A WRITER (or at least i am trying to be ) a certain approach or gettiing me to avoid a certain approach are not going to make me certainly love/like it. Its a bit like saying STOP CLENCHING YOU"LL ENJOY ANAL SEX BETTAH, when the clenching is already an expression of what they like or do not like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206496/#Comment_206496" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T15:31:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  3:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I'm not entirely sure I'm familiar with "failure rewards".<br/><br/>Could anyone give me an example?<br/><br/>Or, perhaps I'm just more familiar with ad-hoc, socially derived,failure rewards.</blockquote>\nA failure reward is really just a reward that you provide to a player when his character fails in a conflict.  The idea here is to give the player rational reasons to put his character in situations where he is going to fail, and to follow through with that failure.<br/><br/>Capes has two important resources: Debt and Story Tokens.  Story Tokens are a standard resource in that having more of them is always beneficial.  Debt is actually a Conflicted Resource, in that having some Debt is good for a player, but having too much is bad.  The conflict resolution mechanic is rather involved, so I won\u2019t go into detail about it here.  However, one important aspect of the conflict resolution system is that \u201cDebt\u201d can be staked on a conflict to improve a player\u2019s chances in winning the conflict.  If this is done, the winner converts the Debt that he staked into Story Tokens, which are then given to the conflict\u2019s loser.  So, character failure is a way in which a player can gain Story Tokens if he finds himself in short supply.  Thus, it is a Failure Reward.<br/><br/>Dog in the Vineyard conflicts impose \u201cFallout\u201d on the loser of the contest.  The effects of Fallout include injuries to the character, incidental damage to the character\u2019s equipment, and the like.  However, it also sometimes rewards the player as well.  These include such things as adding points to an attribute, adding a new trait to the character, or increasing or decreasing the potency of an existing Trait (player option). <br/><br/>Torg has a "Hero Fails" subplot card which guarantees the hero fails at some critical task in exchange for a Possibility Point reward later in the game. The player determines whether or not to play the subplot card, but when and how it is invoked is up to the Game Master once the card is in play.<br/><br/>If you're interested, you can read a thorough analysis of Failure Rewards in my RPG Design Patterns book, which you can download from <a href="http://legendaryquest.com/books/Patterns.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206514/#Comment_206514" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T21:24:46+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  9:24PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently I was just being thick.
