They should be loaded though, and relate a little bit to the adventure, or at least be asked in such a way that they are easy to fit into it.<br/>I'd also love to structure it a little bit better and making it into a nice little pdf-thing, but I tend to say that a lot and never end up doing it. In any case, I want to finish the text before starting a layout process.<br/><br/>Oh, and any ideas that can amp up the creepy atmosphere is greatly appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421849/#Comment_421849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T06:23:29+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  6:23AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My initial thought on reading it was "Who are the characters?"<br/><br/>In general, I think Cthulhu games work well with pregens in a way other games don't, especially ones tied into the scenario.<br/><br/>These are the idea and influences that immediately popped into my mind (influenced by the fact that I'm an American and get all of my ideas about UK culture from media):<br/><br/>One of the characters has suddenly found themselves out to be a local titled sort, something they weren't expecting or necessarily groomed to be which puts them in the center of this whether they wanted to be or not. Maybe they've been away for a long time in other parts of the world and look at what's going on locally as old time superstition and parochialism ( Monarch of the Glen/Downton Abbey/Lair of the White Worm).<br/><br/>Childhood fears, either from your creepy "boy who cried wolf story" or some brief brush with the thing, possibly along with other local kids ( <i>It</i>) in the past. <br/><br/>Creepy laughter and blood? Well, shell-shocked veterans of Flanders are always a solid bet if you set it in the '20s or '30s. Howabout some nasty flashbacks to the trenches?<br/><br/>Class warfare and misunderstandings. Could go either way with this. Since the creature does have some hallmarks of classic vampires right up until the reveal at the end, a red-herring pointing to the rather strange and removed new aristo in the neighborhood might be in order. Going the other way, you've got that vampire cult mentioned tracing back to ancient times. Does it survive as some sort of quiet thing among the rural lower classes? Who is in on it? Is it possible the local aristo and family are to be the sacrifice? Or are they being groomed as leaders? Howabout strangers in town (Wicker Man).<br/><br/>Local religious leaders, hunters, veterinarians (multiple influences)- those guys always seem tied into this somehow, either as investigators or perpetrators/allies of the horror.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421850/#Comment_421850" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T06:37:05+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  6:37AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for creepy? Not sure. <br/><br/>That echoing laughter thing alone, unseen really does it for me, so I'd personally play that part up.<br/><br/>I'd imagine the big reveal towards the end would be pretty creepy too, especially if the players aren't CoC fans familiar with Star Vampires, that what has appeared to be some sort of traditional vampire (human animated blood drinking corpse) is this entirely alien <i>thing</i>. I think that would give me a chill, even fully knowing I was playing a Cthulhu game from the get-go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/waqii" title="waqii"><img alt="waqii" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nKKM3K4RK06QZ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/waqii">waqii</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421853/#Comment_421853" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T07:18:52+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  7:18AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's a lot of really good ideas.
