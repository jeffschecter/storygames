It makes use of quite laden symbolism, and encourage a kind of violence that is far from the happy go-lucky hack'n slash of old.<br/><br/>Sage says this about it:\n<blockquote><i>I tend to like games that in some way create and resolve conflict via mechanical systems, and while I think your entry does a really good job of making people think about their choices (and probably make them feel very awkward in the process <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ), that doesn't make it a game for me. I think your piece has a lot of value as a way for creating creative responses and communicating a theme.</i></blockquote>\nThank you, Sage, for reading the game and giving it such praise.<br/><br/>I wonder about your wording: <i>I tend to like games that in some way create and resolve conflict via mechanical systems.</i><br/><br/>Have you actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tested</span> other ways of creating and resolving conflicts in games? Are you talking from an informed position? I ask this due to the generalization you make here. It always makes me suspicious when people do that: are they distancing themselves from my game by saying that, or is it for real ...<br/><br/>Do you <i>know </i>that you would not like this game, if you ever played it? Could it be that your hypothesis on this is faulty, building on a <i>preconception of games</i> that don't really suit this special game?<br/><br/>Could it be, actually, that if you <i>played </i>this game you would be morfe likely to call a game afterwards?<br/><br/>I know the design is challenging, so I'm giving you all these questions to make you think through the statement you have made on it.<br/><br/><i>That was my answer (questions) to Sage.</i><br/><br/><b>To all of you:</b> I make games for people. I like it when people read them, and enjoy it when someone is playing them. I challenge you to read my game and to play it. I dare you! ;-)<br/><br/>My game is made in earnest, in a spell of inspiration. I had little control over the outcome, but acted on inspiration and whim, mellowed by my experience as a games designer. I acknowledge that most of us are challenged by this game. I am challenged by it myself. I know for a fact that I could not bring my own teddy to the game (my wife would kill me), so when I eventually play it, it will have to be with a "proxy" teddybear. And still I believe that it will be a tough game for me.<br/><br/>But in spite of this I also believe this game will be fun. Fun in a challenging way, an intriguing and meaningful way. So I am really looking forward to playing it.<br/><br/>Any comments on the game is welcome! Don't be shy! I really don't know how the game would play, as I wrote it the way I did and posted it immediately, so any speculation and/or reaction is valid. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173674/#Comment_173674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T19:53:42+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  7:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Do you <i>know</i> that you would not like this game, if you ever played it?

He comes up to me on the playground, and hands me a small rock covered with dirt and moss and what I can only describe as slime.  "Try this, daddy!" he says, "You might like it!"  Then he stared at me intently, clearly waiting to see whether I had some excuse (which he would later use) that would get away from the whole "You don't know until you've tried it" argument.<br/><br/>For my son, to prevent an argument with a toddler about nuanced concepts, I licked the slime-covered rock, made a face, and said "I've tried it.  I didn't like it."<br/><br/>Grown-ups shouldn't need to have the nuances pointed out to them.  We are, in fact, able to extrapolate our <i>general</i> tastes and preferences, and apply them to particulars without having to actively sample.<br/><br/>I have not played <i>Raven - claw and beak</i>, but I can see the structure of it:  It is sequential viking hat GMing, in which the only "game" is a freeform round of kibbitzing between a vested-but-disempowered audience and a single central actor with absolute fiat authority over the story, and only tenuous social incentives to listen to any kibbitzing.  I have seen that dynamic many times, both in innumerable home-brews and in published games (<i>Amber</i> leaps to mind).<br/><br/>I am perfectly willing to hear a case that there is a dynamic I am overlooking, which makes this <i>more</i> than what I've just outlined ... but right now, I'm basically of the same mind as when I'm offered someone's special eggplant risotto:  I don't need to try it.  I already know.  I've tried all sorts of eggplant dishes, and didn't like any of them.

A game that comes to mind to compare to your is Universalis, a game that I can't say I'm fond of, or Amber as Tony mentioned. Maybe I didn't play them with the right group, or maybe it's just not my thing, but I tend to like games where mechanics aid in the creation and resolution of conflicts, and I don't quite see that in your submission. My Life With Master or carry come to mind as games that work better for me, they communicate some themes through the mechanics.<br/><br/>So, no, I can't say that I've tried your submission. Maybe I will some day. I'm just a bit more traditional (I guess) in my taste in games, so I can take an educated guess that it won't be for me. Like I said, I actually think your submission is pretty awesome. It just doesn't really fall within what I consider a game.<br/><br/>And, by the way, a forum where naming My Life With Master and carry as games you like makes you a traditionalist is an interesting place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173691/#Comment_173691" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T22:47:45+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that one of the main underlying purposes of role-playing games is to enable us to explore life from alternate perspectives through the creation of alternate conceptions of the self.<br/><br/>Raven is like group therapy, and suffers from the same basic ideology: that there is, in fact, a single "self" at the center of each of us that we need to get in touch with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173711/#Comment_173711" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T01:18:56+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:18AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 1:29AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>I think that one of the main underlying purposes of role-playing games is to enable us to explore life from alternate perspectives through the creation of alternate conceptions of the self..</blockquote>Wow! This is very close to how I would describe the workings of this game. So how come you think this is arguing what this game is not?<br/><br/>I do not postulate that there is any "single self" hidden in you or me that we need to come in contact with. Raven is not created for such a purpose. It is created for players to have fun with serious issues, while exploring alternate perspectives to known conflicts, and perhaps trying out alternate conceptions of ourselves. Now you know that, so how can you resist the urge to try this game, John Kantor? It must be <i>made for you</i>, man!<br/><br/>As for Tony's allegation about "viking hat GMing": if you choose to look at it that way, it will be, of course. I do not work within the limits of prejudice, I challenge them. That stance enabled me to create one of the most successful railroading scenarios ever for my game Fabula, while everybody else in my clique of players were agreeing to how bad railroading were. "Railroading" as a term was coined from GMs misusing their power, but grew into stopping all use of heavy GM- or narrative-power in the service of other goals (goals not achievable in other ways).<br/><br/>I expect the use of total authority for the center-player in this game will have a very benign effect on the single scenes, and on the game as a whole. It is a postulate by me, but I do believe this is the case. Tony is still right in his assumptions, I think, but only to the degree that you play this game with his stance. Shed the stance that this will not work, and try the game with an open frame of mind, and you may very well experience something quite different from what you express here, Tony. I do think there is a dynamic to this game that you are overlooking. The dynamic is partly lying in how the PC vs NPC set-up is reversed. In this game most players play the NPCs, <b>and they are close friends and families to the PC</b> (playing on such relations is something most of us do easily), and the PC is alone. So: there is indeed powerful social dynamics present in the game. The <i>friends and family</i> are instructed to oppose the PC, you know. The fact that the PC-player has total power over the outcome makes this interesting, in my eyes.<br/><br/>I know for a fact that <b>RAVEN </b>is not <i>free-form</i> or <i>magic-ritual</i> or anything other hocus-pocus you may come up with. I am a bit irritated over repeated allegations that <i>this </i>is therapy, and <i>that </i>is obviously a magic ritual, and over <i>there </i>we have a typical drama-excercise, etc. I meet such allegations all the time, even on games that I know are great games. Such "stamping" smells too heavy of people trying to place challenging games in a box marked "<b>BLUFF!</b>"<br/><br/>This is a methodically stringent game laden with powerful dynamics. I do not say that it is a successful design yet, but it is certainly a powerful text, and my experience with similar games indicates that this game may very well turn out to be a gem. And until the game has shown itself to be faulty in actual play, I will maintain a positive stance towards it. Any design of serious intent deserves as much, in my eyes.<br/><br/><i>Tony: your tale about the 4 year old miss the mark, although it is a nice tale. I have children too, and love these small tales of exploration, inventiveness and bravado. I am in fact in the process of writing a book on the theme, with a friend of mine. I believe the simple answer to you son would be: <b>This is not food, so we don't have to taste it. Food is something we respect to much to put in the bin without tasting it first. Go play now, little one! </b></i><br/><br/>I respect the complicated nature of games too much to say they don't work before I have tried them. If you dare to try out this game in earnest, some of you may very well have your eyes going wide open! ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173719/#Comment_173719" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T03:06:36+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:06AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game edited now, in the game-entry thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173750/#Comment_173750" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:14:08+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:14AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 6:16AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>Why are you irritated by the analysis of your game in terms of a magical ritual?

The practice of putting challenging game design in other compartments, where we don't have to relate to it as a game, is another.

I'm not interested in 'magic rituals' (as part of a game or the whole) and a work that puts no constraints on me, I feel like I'd just as soon sit down with some friends without teddybears and knives and discuss choices and repercussions. <br/><br/>I like most of these pieces, just not as a game. The story-telling method of one narrator with others filling in particular characters is fun to watch and to participate in. Tearing apart teddybears is a strong obvious symbol of certain kinds of pain, and it could be used in any number of ways. I just don't feel like putting the two together makes a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173858/#Comment_173858" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T11:15:55+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 11:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite> As a game, my judgment is that it has a long way to go.

So I have to agree, I can't see many constraints to this game. HOWEVER, I can imagine that you could start faking some emotions for fun when you stab the bears (in fact, you're quite likely to, as it's a weird and potentially humorous thing), and faking emotions leads to experiencing emotions, and might lead to more intense descriptions of hurting people you know, giving birth to an emotional loop of sorts, which might produce some interesting stuff. I wouldn't call it "constraints", but I can see how this game could get some emotions going.<br/><br/>Not sure about the ritual phrases, though. They'd work if you only said them once, but every player says them four times, and I think that will lessen the emotional content of them rather than increasing it. Having each player come up with his or her OWN way of comforting the bear would be, I think, more effective. But I'm not as experienced in this weird shit as Tomas is, so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm wrong on this one.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure it'd work (and I'm not sure this is the way Tomas intended it to work), but I can see that it COULD happen this way. If it does, it's an interesting game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174290/#Comment_174290" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T08:46:33+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  8:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of being a shill (though I make nothing on the game), I think RAVEN is a LOT like For Mature Audiences, my Game Chef 2008 entry:<br/><a href="http://davidartman.com/games/for-mature-audiences" rel="nofollow">http://davidartman.com/games/for-mature-audiences</a><br/><br/>I might note, however, that FMA has far more "mechanical" hooks (pun intended) for exploring an individual's personal issues, through the agency of maiming a plush toy.

(You see the logical flaw, there?)<br/><br/>But there's sort of an accepted meaning (in English) of the word "game" (uh, oh, here we go...) and it includes at least some feedback loop between mechanics and constraints--otherwise, it's "let's pretend," AKA "freeform."<br/><br/>But I'm really just tryin' to bridge a denotative gap (as I see it) in this thread, using FMA as an example of "just a bit more" mechanics that, possibly, leads it being more-likely designated as a game. If it's muddying the waters, ignore it. But I think it helps draw a continuum between RAVEN and, say, Burning Empires (an off-the-cuff choice as a very mechanics-heavy game in which the mechanics tightly constrain player options in narration and conflict resolution).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174353/#Comment_174353" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T13:16:56+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  1:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh!

If the non-PCs aren't pushing for a painful solution then they're not doing their job.  They are effectively breaking the rules.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with Seth Ben-Ezra's game "A Flower For Mara"?  It's about dealing with grief.  All the main characters are people with an immediate relationship to Mara, a woman who has died suddenly and unexpectedly.  In the game you hold a flower.  As long as you are holding the flower you are ruled by your grief.  You put the flower down when you feel as though your character is moving on from their grief.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: Mara is a real live player in the game.  The text makes it clear that she is not a ghost but instead is the collective memories of Mara.  Her JOB in the game is get the players to NOT put down their flowers.  Her job is make sure Mara is remembered....AT ALL COSTS... and that the characters DON'T move on from their grief.<br/><br/>If the Mara player is not willing to be an emotional antagonist then she is not playing the game correctly.  I see the same thing here.  If the other players are not trying to anger you.  Not trying to push, and push and push to make you do something painful then they're simply not performing their role in the game.<br/><br/>I also suspect that "painful" does not have to be anything over the top.  You don't have to strangle your mom and bury her corpse in the backyard or anything.  I assume that gritting your teeth together and saying, "Fuck you, slut" to your girlfriend before slamming the door is sufficiently painful.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_174423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174423/#Comment_174423" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T19:48:14+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  7:48PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You got it, Jesse.

I'll have to look at it some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_174477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174477/#Comment_174477" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T10:57:17+00:00" title="October 10, 2008 10:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2008 10:59AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be fair, Sage:<br/><br/>From "<b><span style="color: #660000;">Details on conflict</span></b>":<br/><span style="color: #660000;">They will push and pull at you with their voices, to make you change your resolve and seek solutions more in tune with their ideas. <b>They will always be people with ideas different from yours</b>, and perhaps even with principles/ideals that is contrary to the solution you propose.

You might want to clarify your intent there, because the passage taken as a whole indicates that, while the other players always have to have different ideas than you, they only might oppose you. <br/><br/>Suppose Bob is recalling his teenage years when he hated his life with his parents.<br/><br/>Example 1:<br/>Bob wants to drop out of high school and join the army. Mary wants Bob to get his GED first. Mary's proposal does not overlap with Bob's course of action, but is not mutually exclusive with Bob's course of action. Mary has fulfilled her obligation to the rules, though Bob can satisfy her desire while still executing his own course of action. Bob may very much not want to take the time to get his GED, so the combination solution may seem unpleasant for him, but it is possible. People very often go with these sorts of compromise solutions.<br/><br/>Example 2:<br/>Bob wants to drop out of high school and join the army. Mary wants Bob to finish high school, marry her, not join the army, and get a job at her father's company. Bob's course of action and Mary's proposal are mutually exclusive, and Bob cannot satisfy her desire and his own simultaneously. Bob is now in a true dilemma, assuming that he fears the consequences of telling Mary "no."<br/><br/>Example 3:<br/>As 1 and 2, but Mary simply doesn't want Bob to do that. She offers no alternative, but simply opposes Bob's intended course of action. Bob can't simultaneously do and not do the same thing, since Bob is a macroscopic being ruled by classical mechanics rather than quantum mechanics, so he is again faced with a true dilemma. <br/><br/>I think you're driving for situations like 2 and 3 to occur, but the current rules make 1 also reasonable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_174491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174491/#Comment_174491" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T12:08:31+00:00" title="October 10, 2008 12:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you think I'm driving for situations 2 and 3 to occur, then that must be due to the text.

In the join the army example, if someone else wants me to join the marines, I'm not sure if that's allowed in this. Seems like they've met the letter of the rules at least.<br/><br/>I think the rest of my points stand. I can still see lots of people taking on similar goals, with minor variations. Additionally, what if they offer a solution that is obviously better? There's no conflict if I want to drop out and join the army, and another player comes in as a school administrator and suggests that he could pull some strings to get me an honorary degree so I can ship off right now.<br/><br/>Granted these are somewhat meta issues, perhaps dealing with the social contract more then anything. The issue is, I'm not sure what the social contract here is, and when I think I get it it seems more like the social contract of a therapy group then a gaming group. That can be a very good thing, group therapy can be wonderfully sucessful, it just doesn't sound like something you play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_174508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174508/#Comment_174508" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T14:10:57+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  2:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2008 2:13PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric and Sage: I will come back to this thread when I have tested the game.

I am quite satiesfied with empty praise up until the game has been tested. ;-)<br/><br/>The question if this game is rewarding to play is still to be answered. It is intended to fascilitate an investigation of destructive life-choices, with the real-life conflicts of the participant as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">basis</span> for each scene (to start and frame the scene, not to direct it). It is not meant as a terapeutic excercise. It is, however, serious in intent, so I expect it to give experiences of greater actuality for the participants than the average rpg.<br/><br/>I will come back to you when I have tested it, and I hope to see some actual play reports from others too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_202033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202033/#Comment_202033" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T15:29:43+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  3:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7801&amp;page=1#Item_48" rel="nofollow">RAVEN - claw and beak</a></b>. was played on the Danish game-con Fastaval this easter. I was not present, but I got a report. Here it is:<br/><br/><b>Here is the feedback from the players of Raven at Fastaval.</b><br/>Two groups played, each with five players as far as I recall. <br/><b><br/>How great was the experience (1-7, 7 is best)?</b><br/><br/>7, 6, 5, 7, 7, 5, x, 5, 2, 3<br/><br/><b>How was your character (1-6, 6 is best)?</b><br/><br/>5, 4, x, 6, x, 4, 3, 4, 1, 4<br/><br/>Worked very well<br/><br/>There were no characters<br/><br/>It is self therapy in the company of strangers<br/><br/>I think the game need examples on how to create character \u2013 what info to give<br/><br/><br/><b>How was the story, you created (1-6, 6 is best)?</b><br/><br/>6, 6, x, 6, x, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3<br/><br/>It was personal without being unpleasant. Perfect for play with people you don\u2019t know<br/><br/>Very personal and honest with strangers<br/><br/>Great when great \u2013 boring when not great. Uneven.<br/><br/>Well. It was our own stories.<br/><br/><br/><b>How was the mechanics (1-6, 6 is best)?</b><br/><br/>5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3<br/><br/>We deviated slightly from the original form but it was still really great<br/><br/>Cool with teddies<br/><br/>Very good idea, the rules worked well, but first round was too tight. We followed the idea, not the rules<br/><br/>We chose to add a razor blade and two knives<br/><br/>Love the teddy \u2013 but the game lacks support for creating scenes and a GM is needed.<br/><br/>The teddy idea might work \u2013 I\u2019m not sure it worked here. But only one teddy had true emotional value. All others were newly bought.<br/><br/><br/><b>Additional comments:</b><br/><br/>The game is not a game but therapy for role-players.<br/><br/>Splendid self therapy, helps a lot with releasing some anger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
