Regardless if you like the changes or not, paizo is keeping 3.x alive and having organized play in one form or the other, which may stall at least the inevitible decline of 3.x into 2nd edition levels of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205141/#Comment_205141" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T08:37:14+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  8:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As far as I can tell, Pathfinder is basically a thing that exists so that people can still make 3e OGL products.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205155/#Comment_205155" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T09:08:36+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  9:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A little background.

Also making high-level play more balanced and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I've been disappointed with Pathfinder in that in feel the mechanics have remained too close to the 3rd Edition rules. Just because part of the market is dissatisfied with 4th Edition doesn't mean that 3rd did not have a lot of issues in need of addressing. The below critiques are from reading the PDF, not play experience.<br/><br/>Things I wish Pathfinder changed: <br/><br/>A weak fighter class <br/>Front-loaded or imbalanced races <br/>Making characters less dependent on gear, especially armor <br/>Making characters less dependent on healing<br/>Making combat run faster<br/>Streamlined skills system<br/>Eliminating dead levels<br/>Uniform class progressions (like Star Wars Saga)<br/>Unique talent trees replacing class abilities (like D20 Modern and Star Wars Saga) <br/><br/>The above is rather a biased take on 3rd Edition and more about what I wanted to see from Pathfinder than about Pathfinder's own merits.  But if any of the above bothered you, they\u2019re still in Paizo's product.  I know a lot of people also wanted grappling and multiclassing to be addressed in Pathfinder, and they were not.  Right now, the Pathfinder book just reads like a bunch of new options for 3rd Edition, rather than an evolution of the game engine.<br/><br/>There is some cool stuff in there, like the sorcerer lineages and whatnot.  But it's not a radical re-development if you\u2019re familiar with a lot of 3rd Edition products.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205174/#Comment_205174" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T10:16:57+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 10:16AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not really out for-real, and I don't feel like being a playtester for it, so I can't really say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205179/#Comment_205179" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T10:47:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 10:47AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, I believe that True20 is the better 3.x successor.  It's cleaner and more elegant, plus it actually improves some game mechanisms.  For instance, it gets rid of HP and the attendant issues... in favor of a damage-and-soak wound-level system with its attendant issues; it imports the "raise" mechanism from the XkY system used in AEG's games (L5R and 7S).  Also, it requires only and exactly a d20 for every randomization task \u2014 what I had hoped was implied by Wizard's name "d20 system".<br/><br/>So, no, I won't sell you on Pathfinder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205200/#Comment_205200" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T11:56:54+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 11:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running a Pathfinder campaign using the newest beta, and the changes from the first coupla runs are palpable, and strongly differentiate the game from 3.5. The biggest problem I've found in our group is that the several players with D&amp;D experience (I'm running this with my Lacuna group) tend to assume carryover rules from 3.5, but in truth much of the system has changed in many subtle but serious crunch-fun altering ways, which I think are long overdue. They've moved in an opposing direction to 4.0, eschewing board game mechanics and powering up classes to butt heads with the wizard/cleric issue. Many also say monks/rangers/their least favorite class are too powerful in D&amp;D as a whole; Pathfinder, I believe, addresses these issues without bleeding the flavor dry from each class, as I believe 4.0 has. Fighters really do dole out the harshness from 1 to 20, and with the newest changes the classes have been pretty smoothly distributed in power from 1 to 20.<br/><br/>I'm no gamist, truth be told. This isn't my genre, so perhaps the concerns I had with 3.5 and 4.0 aren't the target audience's chief concerns. I feel like Pathfinder was written for me and my group's needs to a T. Every once in a while, we want some war to go along with our conflict, and Pathfinder gives us the tools we need to re-enact a fantasy battle with swift minutiae and enough "wee new stuff!" to be fun without becoming cloying. The system itself, for what it is, is elegant enough, and our only "house rule" is that we roll d20's first, then decide the course/narration of our actions. It's a big change, but I really think it says something to note that's our only hack of what is, essentially, a remix of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>That's my $.02.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205237/#Comment_205237" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T12:57:48+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 12:57PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the excellent reviews, Jarrod and Daniel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205255/#Comment_205255" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T14:06:50+00:00" title="May  4, 2009  2:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're welcome, Andy.
