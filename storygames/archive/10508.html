That is to say a roleplaying game, where the rules propel the fiction as opposed to the fiction invoking the rules. All the games I own seem designed to let the fiction guide the rules. <br/><br/>So I'm curious are there actually games that are designed to be driven by the mechanics or are we making an unnecessarily inclusive distinction here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233254/#Comment_233254" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T06:00:25+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  6:00AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/12" rel="nofollow">It's Complicated</a> has a pretty light system, but the mechanics drive the fiction.

InSpectres is also pretty driven by the mechanics. I haven't played My Life With Master, but isn't that too pretty driven by the mechanics?<br/><br/>In my mind, a game is mechanics-driven when you look to the mechanics instead of the fiction to find out what to do next*. Of course, it's a sliding scale, with "Always look to the mechanics" (Contenders) on one side and "Only engage the mechanics when promted by the fiction" (Apocalypse World?) on the other.<br/><br/>It seems to me that GMless games might lean to the mechanics-driven side more often than not, since the mechanics often take up part of the GM role.<br/><br/>_________<br/>* Just like in a player-driven game you look to the players to find out what to do next, whilst in a GM-driven game you look to the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233263/#Comment_233263" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T07:33:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  7:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 7:35AM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I used the term "mechanics-driven", I meant "Poison'd can seem driven entirely by mechanics, like a board game".<br/><br/>I'm not sure mechanics-driven vs fiction-driven is a useful distinction for roleplaying games.

I've heard of most of them, but haven't gotten around to trying them out.<br/><br/>Graham, <br/>That's how I read your comment as well. It just got me thinking about similiar comments I've heard and this obscure line in the sand that's drawn between the two. Because I agree that it's not a particularly useful distinction when it comes to RPGs. I feel it's far more useful to describe a playstyle or a group's play dynamics this way, but not games. Clouds and boxes seems like a good way of talking about it, even if it is a little too involved for a simple post-game discussion.<br/><br/>Simon, <br/>I've unfortunately never played Contenders. But I'm going to run My Life with Master some time next week. We'll see how that turns out. I'm not sure I would agree with you on InSpecters, though. Whenever I've run the game it played much better and far more fluidly, when we simply pushed the fiction ourselves by invoking the rules as opposed to letting the rules affect the fiction for us. (Which kind of sounds like the same, but to me there is a difference in how much each player is involved in the whole thing, and how much is handed off to the rules.) Basically, when our game was player-driven the rules fell into place and the game worked; but when we relied on the mechanics to drive the game it always felt stale and somewhat hollow. This is hardly surprising of course. But I've heard people distinguish between player-driven and mechanics-driven games (i.e. rules-sets) and I wonder it is ever justified. Or if it isn't just a case of accidentally outsmarting yourself and robbing yourself of a fun new gaming experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233284/#Comment_233284" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T10:26:26+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 10:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said, it's a scale. InSpectres isn't as far (let's say) left as Contenders, but it's still driven partially by the mechanics.<br/><br/>"What happens now?"<br/>"Getting the Call"<br/>"Oh, ok!"<br/><br/>Then some free play. Then,<br/><br/>"What happens now?"<br/>"Research and Investigation"<br/>"Oh, ok!"<br/><br/>The main part (Field Work) is partially mechanics-driven, as you're told to narrate situations where you get to make the rolls and then after a certain number of successful rolls you win.<br/><br/>To repeat, I interpret a game's mechanics-driven-ness as the percentage of the answers to the question "What happens now?" that are determined by the mechanics. In InSpectres, a fair number of them are, but a lot of the time the answer is determined by the fiction. In Contenders, the answer is almost always determined by the mechanics. You set a scene, choose which scene type, freeplay a bit, then make a draw determined by the scene type. Then some more freeplay, then end the scene. Next player, same procedure.<br/><br/>I don't know whether anything good will come of discussing the difference, but that's how I interpret it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
