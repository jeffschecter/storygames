There is another condition that differentiate between a significant, immediate plot  development that requires immediate and meaningful action on part of the player characters AND their players that is a bang, and one that isn't. A REAL CHOICE.<br/><br/>This is a significant, immediate plot  development that requires immediate and meaningful action on part of the player characters AND their players: "while you are in your cell, awaiting your execution in ten minutes, a magic door open in the air, and you see a very beautiful girl at the other side of it. She implores you "quick, flee inside this door, or the universe is doomed!"<br/><br/>This is another significant, immediate plot  development that requires immediate and meaningful action on part of the player characters AND their players: "a trap open below your feet. Roll your acrobatic to avoid falling to your doom"<br/><br/>These are not bangs. There is no real choice.<br/><br/>So, Jason, your point is that instead of using the cumbersome and too difficult to remember word "bangs", we should say every time: "a significant, immediate plot  development that requires immediate and meaningful action on part of the player characters AND their players, who must choose a course of action to follow, in a real meaningful choice"?  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184398/#Comment_184398" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T10:04:35+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 10:04AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BANG!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184405/#Comment_184405" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T10:43:18+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 10:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once with a girl I fell in love now she had <br/>bangs<br/>Are that on which the world hangs<br/>I'm only holding your hand<br/>so I can look at your<br/>bangs                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Did you not read my post closely? <br/><br/>Let me break it down for you. <br/><br/>"Well I'm an axegrinder Piledriver"<br/><br/>Okay, this is significant because it contains both a wrestling move and a reference to sharpening an instrument used to cut people limb from limb, chop down trees, and can also be used as a slang reference for playing an electric guitar. How you chose to read axe in this situation is both significant and immediate, as it will show if you want to rock, if you want to kill, or if you want to ROCK AND KILL at the same time. <br/><br/>"Mother says that I never never mind her"<br/><br/>Now, we don't have to invoke Freud here, but we all know that the deep and abiding relationship with the maternal is a heavily formative function in the lives of every human being. And as a significant relationship, the fact that we are shown tension in that fundamental connection to humanity reveals something about the character. However, we also see the slight weaking in the facade, as we don't actually hear "I never mind her" we hear "says that I never mind her" thus shifting the locus of discontent from the self to the other, showing a projection in order to avoid an over-intimate dealing with the self. <br/><br/>This is how bangs will develop character even when the choice made isn't immediately obvious. <br/><br/>"Got no brains I'm insane"<br/><br/>This is actually a very complicated line, but I won't get into it. Ron said it all better in the famous and well respected Brain Damage thread. Please go read it if you haven't. <br/><br/>"Teacher says that I'm one big pain"<br/><br/>Again, a fundamental relationship of the character is under stress, pushing towards a breaking point. The relationship between teacher and student is significant both in the ancient and honored exchange of ideas that it connotes, but also in the fact that once again we see the protagonist locating the difficulty of the relationship in the other. "Teacher says" -- again, unready to take responsibility for oneself and the way one's actions cause reactions in the external world. <br/><br/>Make a note of this for later, and make sure to have another bang later asking "And now?" "AND NOW?" <br/><br/>"I'm like a laser 6-streamin' razor<br/>I got a mouth like an alligator"<br/><br/>This is clearly from the AP, and is where the character brings in their traits. A g-streamin' razor is worth 3d4, and a mouth like an alligator is a 3d10. So the combination of them together is significant for the upcoming resolution, because we know the player is invested (3d10, Jesus!), but we also know they're looking for complications, thus invoking d4s. So we're looking for a big push, and will want a bang that's capable of pushing back. <br/><br/>"I want it louder<br/>More power<br/>I'm gonna rock ya till it strikes the hour"<br/><br/>And now we come right to it. Notice that the protagonist has finally taken responsibility for their own emotional state "I want" "I'm gonna rock" -- no more are we told "mother says" or "teacher thinks." Finally we've come to the heart of the bang, stripping away all the damage and deprotagonization, all the dodges against making a morally meaningful statement, and are ready to actual reveal what deep and abiding issues of humanity are driving our character. <br/><br/>"Bang your head! Metal Health'll drive you mad<br/>Band your head! Metal Health'll drive you mad<br/><br/>BANG YOUR HEAD!"<br/><br/>Do you see now? <br/><br/>Read that last quote again. Read it carefully this time. <br/><br/>Now....<br/><br/><img alt="lotus" src="http://www.schubart.net/images/LotusFlower.jpeg"/><br/><br/>(It's also worth noting that I just did a text search of Dogs in the Vineyard, Prime Time Adventures, Mouseguard, Nine Worlds Revised, In a Wicked Age, Shock, The Shadows of Yesterday, Don't Rest Your Head, and A Dirty World. The only ones that used the word "bang" like people use it in this thread are TSOY and DRYH -- and both use it only when saying "the concept of X or Y came from bangs in Sorcerer." So, you know, apparently there are other ways in the universe that people, even in the Indie scene, actually manage to sometimes refer to conflicts, GM prep, and ways to set up games without using that one particular word. But now I'm being serious, which is more than this thread deserves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184452/#Comment_184452" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T22:27:36+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 10:27PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with JDCorley, Bangs are awful terminology.<br/><br/>Hell, here's a terrible term that is still better than "bangs."

So anything like "forking path" or "explosive situation" is going to fall short because there are plenty of situations that the term describes that aren't a proper bang. I think "Bang"'s obtuseness is actually an odd virtue: it's a signifier, not a descriptor. Because it doesn't have a commonsense meaning in context, nobody's gonna hear the term and think "oh, I know what <i>that</i> means" and blow it off.

In practice I think this was just because I said I didn't like certain aspects of them, and the reaction was much along the lines of the proposed definitions we've seen here: emphasizing the idea that they're "plot points that demand an immediate decision" as if that told the whole story. It doesn't. Paul gives a much more complete and clear definition, I think, when he says\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>At the level of collaboration among the players, creative efforts by one (or more) have demanded a creative decision by another.</blockquote>In other words, in practice, a Bang isn't a Bang if it's just something that evolves out of the existing continuity without anyone actively pushing it forward, at that moment, for the purpose of provoking a decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184896/#Comment_184896" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-25T07:04:58+00:00" title="December 25, 2008  7:04AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your off on that Elliot.

If I decide on a course of action (in whatever role I will be playing) in advance, does it no longer qualify because it's not improvised "in the moment"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185383/#Comment_185383" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T18:05:04+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  6:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my perspective, I think there's a good chance it doesn't qualify. Here's what I'm talking about: suppose you're the GM, and you decide beforehand that the scenario will feature X, Y, and Z. Maybe the characters have arrived in a grungy city so you decide these will be:<br/><br/>beggars<br/>a ratty gang that runs the place<br/>a military outpost representing the nominal government authority<br/><br/>Now the PCs arrive and one of them gets drunk, shoots up a bar, and is dragged off to jail. The rest of the group survey the situation and decide to cut a deal with the gang leader to help bust him out. The rest of the scenario involves carrying out the plan and possibly setting up future adventures (what are the repercussions of flouting the government? what does the gang want?).<br/><br/>Now, I can kind of see how this fits into Paul's definition. The real "Banger" here is the drunken wildman who sets things in motion, ultimately provoking the decision to ally with the underworld. On the other hand the player wasn't necessarily looking to do that, it all "just happened" as the player "played my character". And since in the real world "Bangs" are something done by the GM, this seems a stretch. (I.e., When "Bangs" are prescribed as a technique or even described in actual play, I never see them as a player action unless someone is trying to make a point.)<br/><br/>More generally, your planned course of action isn't necessarily a Bang because (a) you don't know if it's going to demand a response--everyone else may regard it matter-of-factly without seeing any challenge or moral complication, and (b) <i>you</i> may regard it matter-of-factly. It's the intersection of intention by the "Banger" and reception by the "Bangee" than really makes a Bang a technique that can be applied, and to get that intersection the active ("Banger") party obviously needs to be attentive to the interest of the reactive party, more or less at the moment the Bang is delivered.<br/><br/>Expanding the definition to include any moment when a player stumbles across a challenge or complication, or creates one for himself, just covers too much ground and seems motivated by a desire to overcome resistance to Bangs-as-advocated. Now, I may be mistaken, but if so, I should think that either the term ought to change to indicate a more complete break with <i>Sorcerer</i>, or additional vocabulary needs to be developed to differentiate Bangs that are the product of somebody looking for a reaction, Bangs that "just happen" because someone takes a personal interest (it wasn't intended as a Bang but it provoked action anyway), Bangs that are emergent properties (a back &amp; forth of "this is how the world works" with "this is how my guy would act"), etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
