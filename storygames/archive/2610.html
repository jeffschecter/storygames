This impacts SG's recent discussion on racism, but this time in terms of religious bigotry.  I'm wondering: is there any way to handle imaginary counterparts to real-world faiths in D&amp;D;'s "divine magic system" that isn't horribly offensive?  In the racist art thread, we talked about ways to break down stereotypes and deconstruct prejudices in fiction; I'm wondering how to do that here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all started when I was like, "Oh, if I'm doing medieval Europe, I gotta figure out about how to handle the major religions of the era.  Oh, and then assign domains.  And then... let's see... uh... Alignments.  Oh man."<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the deal: I <i>like</i> the alignment system.  I love that Good and Evil, Law and Chaos are objectively real forces in the world, and you've pledged your allegiance to them.  It's like cosmic political parties of Fantasyland, and being a card-carrying member has effects on your magic powers.  I don't want to get rid of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I don't see any way to assign such labels, even to fantasy-counterparts of the real religions, that doesn't make me terribly uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of points to consider:<br/>\n1.  I'm aware it's only a silly game which will never get played, but even in theory it still kind of upsets me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I don't care that "that's what they really believed back then, so you should reflect that."  If there's a way to reflect prejudice that that doesn't disgust me, great--but I'm kinda thinking that's a contradiction in terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  To me as GM, I'm not trying to label any of these faiths in the real world.  This isn't Real Islam, it's Other Peoples' Imaginary Islam--specifically, as imagined by Europeans during a very unenlightened age.  But honestly I don't think that distinction is particularly meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  It's possible that simply raising the issue this way could cause some critical reflection about religious prejudice in modern day society.  A large part of the Western world's religious bigotry really got rolling in the Middle Ages.  Maybe exploring the history and the mindset of the time would be helpful in combating modern stereotypes.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  It also proves that, wow, the whole idea of applying "Good" and "Evil" to large swaths of people is absolutely nonsensical and, in fact, downright barbaric.  What's it say about us as a society that we keep falling for it, every couple generations?  What's it say about us as gamers that we run around gleefully slaughtering "demi-humans" because they're all shifty, stupid, and evil?<br/>\n======<br/>\nI think part of the problem here is that in D&amp;D;, and possibly other RPG's as well, there's the world of people, and then there's a kind of cosmological superstructure--the gods, magic, alignment, etc.  I don't see a way to do historical-fiction in a "superstructure" game without stepping on some very sore toes, but maybe I'm missing something.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60031/#Comment_60031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T19:54:04+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  7:54PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd assign the faiths domains that didn't reflect good/evil and law/chaos and allow any Cleric to select those domains based on personal alignment, stressing that any faith is composed of a broad assortment of people while retaining whatever domains you find descriptive.<br><br>Otherwise, I agree with you.

Really, if we're going to do the great clashes of Islam and Christianity throughout the ME, we could make one side good and the other bad, or make both bad, and these would all say... something. <br><br>But me, I like the idea for a D&amp;D game of two groups of people who are Lawful and Good who are going to spend 150 years butchering each other because the exact Law and the exact Good that they follow just happen to be different. Rather than a game with ugly-souled Templars fighting noble-savage Turks, or vice versa, I'd love a game where both sides were proud and noble and true and utterly unable to accept the others Law as the Law. Funny enough, this is more or less what the movie Hero did. You could argue it a lot of ways, but there is also a good argument to be made for the major characters in that movie all being Lawful Good. Or at least Neutral Good. And in D&amp;D if you're Neutral Good you can be a Cleric of a Lawful Good god, right?  Also, even if all the Clerics have alignment restrictions, the common worshiper probably doesn't. So your Sufis and Bishops may all be Lawful Good, but your common worshiper can be anything.  <br><br>As for domains, I always say break it up by groups. Different Saints and Orders for the Christians, different law schools, sufis, and ethnic sects for the Muslims. If you're only going to have "Christian" and "Muslim" and maybe "Pagan" and "Heathen" then you've got too few to cover all the domains anyway. So either have sub-sects, or let the clerics chose two domains and then take feats to gain more over time. After all if you're mister big time monotheist, maybe your god can give you all domains -- you just can't start out with all of them because you aren't perfect enough.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60046/#Comment_60046" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T23:49:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand's talking sense.

(The 'religion' of a character in D&amp;D is as far as I can tell entirely defined by what deity he or she worships, which is a pretty bizarre reappropriation of the term in its own right.) A cleric who worships a given deity is expected to have an alignment within one shift of the deity on both axes. So you can have a True Neutral dude who worships a Lawful Good deity, but you can't have a Lawful Evil cleric of the same god.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60077/#Comment_60077" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T05:19:19+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  5:19AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a Lawful Good church, a Chaotic Good charismatic wandering monk (Francis of Assisi, anyone?) and a Lawful Evil secular government would make a <i>spectacular</i> mix.

Thus, an aristocrat who claimed to be Christian could still act in a very un-Christian manner, but in order for a Christian to perform miracles of faith there'd be some Alignment restrictions in place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60081/#Comment_60081" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T05:34:09+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  5:34AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played DnD games where everyone started off Neutral, and the GM would secretly assign your alignment based on your actions.

"the end of days"?) are dwarfed by the many ways that they stand together against the violent, selfish, bigoted forces all around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were doing, say, Hinduism, Confucianism, Buddhism and Shinto all mixed up in the same pot then I'd say you have some issues, because they really do have some core disagreements that can be hard to reconcile.

My suggestion is to relax D&amp;D's restriction that clerics' alignments must be within one step of their deity's. That way you can have evil clerics worshipping good gods, leading good people to do evil things, without having them obviously lose the favor of their god (i.e. their spells).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60151/#Comment_60151" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T10:41:13+00:00" title="March  9, 2007 10:41AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2007 10:42AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, <br><br>Which leads many folks to conclude that things like the Crusades weren't really so much about religion at all.

And that's what's making me uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when I was thinking about this game-world, the Albigensians would have been heretics led by the Anti-Christ (a high-level Half-Fiendish Blackguard).  One half of me is like, "Hey, it's fun to 'fantasy-up' this historical context," and the other half of me is like, "This is completely tasteless and vile."  (I happen to like the Albigensians IRL, and what happened to them was a terrible crime against the human race.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, in the theoretical game, "Good" would be defined as, <i>Actions which tend toward saving the souls of others</i>.

Then you can legitimately have NPCs of different faiths say "Okay, that person casting healing spells <b>should</b> be following the dictates of God, but he's not.

Do the players belong to a culture with highly prejudicial norms? Have the mechanics reflect this. Maybe players spells don't work the same way on the next tribe over because they are outsiders. Maybe they can't heal their neighbors. Maybe they can't hurt them (uh-oh). <br/><br/>Does your setting allow the players to question these cultural norms? Maybe there IS a form of magic that affects the neighbors. But you can't call upon this magic unless you accept that these neighbors are somehow just like you. Maybe challenging your cultural beleifs has a reward, but also a price (not the least of which is becoming a heretic in the eyes of your peers).<br/><br/>Does your setting allow the players to change cultural norms? Include some way for players to aim at and change the prejudice of their own people. The Infection mechanics in Burning Empires do something like this. Mechanics like transcendence in TSOY also give players limited narrative control over the stting. This is also something I'm doing in my current project Mathematica.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60499/#Comment_60499" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T16:13:10+00:00" title="March 11, 2007  4:13PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it might be worth pointing out that D&amp;D's definitions of "Good" and "Evil" are pretty specific and don't necessarily line up with what those terms mean in neither everyday speech nor moral philosophy. I've always thought these were an attempt at genre emulation, particularly the notions of Good and Evil found in Tolkien. (Law-Chaos attempting emulation of the <i>other</i> strain of fantasy morality, a la Moorcock. D&amp;D, in trying to be "fantasy," dumbly combines both tendencies, like Nuts &amp; Gum.) Point being, attempts to map real-world morality to the D&amp;D alignment system always come off as just goofy, and lead to bizarre arguments. "Good" in D&amp;D is some special metaphysical property, possession of which has verifiable supernatural effects.<br/><br/>Ideas:<br/>a) Just jettison the whole alignment system, and you're instantly that much closer to dealing with "real" morality. Alignment-based effects are either removed from the game or based on ad hoc judgments.<br/>b) Redefine "good" and "evil," "law" and "chaos" as seems appropriate for your setting.<br/>c) Replace the default alignments with one or more sets of other diametric opposites. This allows you to communicate what conflicts you want the game to be about. You can be pretty politically incorrect here, but at least you're putting the potentially offensive worldview on display, and can maybe deal with it in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. Nicely, you can declare that alignment-based effect simply map to one of these.<br/>d) To echo Brand's comments, if you replace "gods" with "saints," you've got a setup mechanically identical to D&amp;D's default setup. (The old PC game <i>Darklands</i> used this approach. Actually, the setting you're describing sounds a lot like that game, so you might want to look into it.) If you're keeping "Good-Evil," the evil "gods" are obviously demons, their clerics witches.<br/><br/>If you're <i>really</i> concerned about sensitive exploration of these issues, D&amp;D is the wrong tool for the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60507/#Comment_60507" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T18:59:12+00:00" title="March 11, 2007  6:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also do Albigensians/Cathars etc. as Chaotic and Catholics as Lawful without too much inaccuracy.
