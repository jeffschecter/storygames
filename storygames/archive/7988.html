I started addressing it in a more generic way over <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7974" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I'd like to deal with it concretely.<br/><br/>Here's the thing:<br/><br/>Sometimes, twisted, complex conflicts take place in a game. They don't have two clear sides that can roll off against each other--maybe you're trying to kill me and Jenny is trying to stop you but Bill is defending him from her, and someone's trying to blow up the space station at the same time.<br/><br/>These can get tricky to handle mechanically. The games I've seen that handle this kind of situation well tend to be more or less task resolution-based or have some kind of "hit point" type mechanic that keeps track of characters' ability to "stay in the fight". Often, these two go together: <br/><br/>For instance, one solution is to give each character some kind of "hit point" type tally that the others try to wear down. This is how it works in D&amp;D as well as games like TSoY--you try to knock the other characters out of the fight so you can achieve your goals in the conflict.<br/><br/>Another cool solution I've seen is used in the games Capes and Beast Hunters: each "goal" is essentially given some kind of "hit point" type tally that the characters then take turns building up or tearing down.<br/><br/>Both solutions are great in that they allow you to break a conflict of any complexity into small, discrete actions taken by the characters, in whatever order. The "hit points" (or something similar) tell you when someone has been knocked out of the fight or when a specific goal has been achieved.<br/><br/>(IaWA is an interesting hybrid in that it kind of has "hit points", but they are not about the current conflict but about the character's ability to participate in the entire chapter.)<br/><br/>Anyway, what I'm kind of missing is an elegant way to handle a complex conflict without all those actions and counter-actions and without tracking "hit points" or some other reference. Sometimes, I want the simplicity of setting stakes and making one roll, like you might do in a game like The Pool. But I'm at a bit of a loss in figuring out clever and easy ways to do that with complex conflicts (i.e. more than two competing sides).<br/><br/>Is there a way to use a simple "stakes setting" approach in complex conflicts? I'm not married to setting stakes up-front, but I do want the outcome of the conflict to be about the fiction (e.g. "I steal the ring") and not about bits of character Effectiveness, or damage/Harm, or some other mechanical incentive.<br/><br/>What are cool or easy solutions other games use? <br/><br/>What kinds of solutions have not been tried? What kinds would you like to see implemented?<br/><br/>Please help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176583/#Comment_176583" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:01:49+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:01PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA handles this rather elegantly by comparing your score against the Producer's(GM's).

Either that or you have to limit the types of stakes that are possible (you can never have stakes like "I stop him"). <br/><br/>If I'm wrong (I've only played PTA once), can someone explain how it works?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176587/#Comment_176587" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:11:47+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what you're describing is WHY cards are always compared with the producer.  Each person is trying to accomplish something.  Each person may or may not get what they want.  It's High Card Player's job to synthesize those results.  The only limitations is that stakes can not be mutually exclusive.  If someone is simply trying to stop someone else, they don't get cards.  They can spend Fan Mail on the Producer's behalf.  This is another reason why pre-negotiation of outcomes is problematic.  When you have four Stakes with Yes or No each it can be hard to determine what the outcome of one will be if you don't know Yes or No on the other Stakes.<br/><br/>Now what you might not like is that opposition is uniform.  The producer has one set of cards he's playing against everyone.  So anything which gives him more cards, gives him more cards against everyone.<br/><br/>The solution to that is fairly easy, simply have the Producer deal a separate run of cards for each participant.  If you're modifying PtA I'd jigger the Budget a bit.  But if you're building your own system, simply take that into account if that's an effect you want.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176588/#Comment_176588" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:20:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know: I haven't played PTA all that much, but the method sounds very limiting. It makes it difficult to base opposition on the capabilities of your opponents. It also makes each person choose to either chase their own goal OR try to stop someone else.<br/><br/>I can certainly see why this mechanic works well in PTA, but it doesn't seem like it would function well in another type of game.

If you Answer someone, you lose your ability to be a Challenger in that round.  In Sorcerer you have a choice.  When you're the target of something and you haven't acted yet you can either give up your goal and defend with full dice or keep your goal and defend with 1 die.<br/><br/>And in both those cases you can only do that when someone is acting directly against you.  In NEITHER system can you try to hit Alice AND try to stop Bob from shooting Carl.<br/><br/>Also, I think you're discounting the fact that things in In A Wicked Age and Sorcerer scale.  If someone is trying to blow up the space station and we really don't care about the cat-and-mouse game that underlies that process that might very well be their declared action (in Sorcerer) or Challenge (in In A Wicked Age).  Integrating that with smaller scale actions takes a bit of artistry (by design) but it can be done.<br/><br/>You mentioned opposition based on ability.  That indeed is NOT a feature of PtA.  Screen Presence and Budget are pretty monolithic in that game.  But I'm a little curious as to what your goal is here.  Are you looking for a game with the features you want or are you trying to cobble together features for something of your own design?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176591/#Comment_176591" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:39:12+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>An alternative could be a sort of hot-potato/give me the brain style mechanic. Basically stakeholders pass around token that gives narrative authority, but having it reduces your chances of your stakes being dominant at the end of some timing mechanic (like mechaton's doomsday clock).<br/><br/>One example could be ten cards (1-10) evenly distributed among the stakeholders (with any remainders left on the table). Then the player with the token controls 1 or more aspects of the current situation. For each she must pass a card (from the unclaimed cards first) to another stakeholder, a stakeholder can be given at most 1 card by the token holder until the token is passed.Then the token holder may pass the token to a stakeholder with 2 or more cards (if the token holder has no cards remaining or has given each other stakeholder a card, then she must do this). Then when the clock runs down, a d10 is rolled. The stakeholder with the card matching the value rolled receives their stake.<br/><br/>Not entirely happy with that, but perhaps food for thought.<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176592/#Comment_176592" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:40:57+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2008 12:43PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You do have to limit the stakes in PTA, but not to the point that you always rule something out like "I stop him" - caveat the only thing typically ruled out is character death, although on a spotlight or season finale, you could lift the ban.<br/><br/>Let's say Andy is trying to kill Pat, Jenny's trying to stop Andy, and Bill is trying to stop Jenny.  And then Zorak is trying to blow up the station.<br/><br/>Clearly, Zorax is in a completely different conflict.<br/><br/>Now, how PTA does it, is ask what do we really want?  Maybe Andy wants to hurt Pat, or hurt Jenny by killing Pat, or to stop Pat from insulting him anymore. Now, it's true, Andy can't win at killing Pat and Jenny win at stopping him.  Since that's a potential in PTA, someone has to give.  <br/><br/>Let's say that Andy wants Pat dead.  So that's his stake, Pat dies.  Jenny wants, more than anything, Andy not to be a murderer. Bill doesn't want Jenny getting mixed up in the fight, so his stake is to keep her out. Pat also wants to live (but Pat's cool with Andy having that stake since its the season finale), but he can't conflict with Andy, so he makes his stake Andy forgives him. Now he kind of hopes he dies to see how it plays out next season.<br/><br/>Okay, cards are dealt.  Andy wins. Jenny wins. Bill loses. Pat wins.  What happens? Well, who gets narration?  In this case it doesn't matter, but here are the narrator's limits. Pat must die. Andy is not a murderer. Jenny gets mixed up in the fight. Andy forgives Pat for insulting him.  So, one way to narrate would be Andy and Pat are fighting, really dirty, really ugly. Bill is holding Jenny at bay, but she breaks free to try and stop the fight. In the chaos, she knocks Pat into some exposed pipe, impaling him. With his last words, Pat confesses some truth about why he was so insulting and asks for forgiveness, which Andy does.  In a real game, you'd have each character's issue to look towards to give you better inspiration (Maybe Pat would want to Andy to get arrested, or Jenny confesses her love), and the narrator gets freedom to decide exactly how the stakes play out.<br/><br/>Next post I'll give a shout out to IAWA.<br/><br/>X-posted with Jesse TWICE, wymrwood, and Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176593/#Comment_176593" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T12:42:22+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:42PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>I'm asking because I'm running into this as a design issue in a game I'm working on.

If you want to do something, I can roll to oppose you and, as a result, I might not only stop you but also get what I want (for example, if I double you, and then negotiate my desired stakes instead of injuring or exhausting you). But IaWA does a lot of funny things because of the way it's designed--and in situations like the one I'm envisioning, it would depend highly on the fiction and the context.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure what scale has to do with this. I do understand that scale is a flexible component we can play with in most games like this. Am I missing something?

As Jesse mentions, if you answer you don't get to challenge.  You never get what you want as a result of a conflict. Only out of negotiation.  Even if all you want was to injure or exhaust them, that's a part of negotiation.<br/><br/>So, let's back up:<br/>Let's say Andy is trying to kill Pat, Jenny's trying to stop Andy, and Bill is trying to stop Jenny. And then Zorak is trying to blow up the station.<br/><br/>Clearly, Zorax is in a completely different conflict.<br/><br/>Andy, Pat, Jenny, and Bill roll.  Andy wins and says "I smash Pat's face into the airlock door."  Pat answers, gains advantage and says "When you put your hand on my head I grab your wrist and flip you on your back. Since Jenny is trying to stop the fight, she could also answer, and so could Bill. They do. Jenny rolls, gains advantage and says "I jump on top of you, pinning you to the ground."  Bill gets less than have. He says "Fuck" and Andy says "I have no beef with you, lets say Jenny knocked you out with an elbow, no injury or exhaustion, but you'll be unconcious for a while."  That's cool with Bill. Since everyone answered, that takes case of that round. Jenny's the underdog and goes on the Owe List.<br/><br/>Next round, everyone rolls, Jenny takes the lead and says "I grab Pat's hand and pry it off Andy's wrist, shoving him backwards once its free."  Pat answers, he loses advantage, but stays in the fight. Andy gets to Challenge now, "Jenny's still on my chest, I heave her towards Pat, and they collapse in a pile of tools."  Jenny and Pat answer. Jenny wins advantage, Pat loses advantage. Jenny says "I squirm free and roll aside" and Andy says "Pat gets tripped up in our scuffle and grabs at the shelves put pulls down a bunch of lose tools and is sprawled next to me and in between us is a sharp hull-cutter."<br/><br/>Finale round, everyone rolls, Jenny wins (she's got two advantage dice!). She says "I come back over and put a foot firmly on Andy's chest, grab the cutter and hold it toward pat and say 'Now boys, it's time to behave.'" Both answer. Pat loses, and is out. Andy wins, so Jenny's out.  Pat negotiates with Jenny "How about I go back to quarters and stay there?"  "How about you go back to your quarters and stay there for the next hour, caught in your own thoughts and reduce With Love?"  Andy tells Jenny "I can't think of any terms, so you're Exhausted."<br/><br/>Then the GM says, "So, Zorax, how are you doing with that bomb of yours?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176601/#Comment_176601" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T13:14:05+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  1:14PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2008 1:19PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin,<br/><br/>Thanks.

IaWA would be a pretty crappy game if you didn't have the "reduce two forms" as a default condition, a base to negotiate from. For my game, I'd like to keep the consequences to purely fiction-related stuff as much as possible.<br/><br/>IaWA's mechanics are also deeply dependent on the setup of the game: namely, that it has discrete Chapters, and that you can't "heal" your die losses within a chapter.<br/><br/>So, it's kind of the inspiration for my attempt to find a good solution, but it's so tightly constructed that I can't just pull it out and throw it into another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176603/#Comment_176603" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T13:32:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  1:32PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul T, lets break down the problem.

Say the best roll wins both resolution and initiative. The second best roll may have "beat" their opponent(s) for resolution but since they lost the initiative, there's a chance that other people may <i>invalidate</i> their goals.<br/><br/>But here are some examples from a fictional game. In the first, resolution order and resolution success are determined with the same d20 roll (vs. a static target number). In the second, resolution order is determine by secretly committing a number of "initiative tokens" and resolution success is determined with the d20 roll (vs. a d20 defense roll of some kind).<br/><br/><b>Example 1:</b><br/><br/>Adam wants to kill Bob with the hammer.<br/>Bob wants to push Carrie into the pit.<br/>Carrie wants take the hammer from Adam and throw it down the pit.<br/><br/>Say we use a simple d20 + modifiers system to handle both resolution and initiative. Adam rolls 15. Bob rolls 14. Carrie rolls 20.  Let's say the rules define a 12 as the target number for success (or we could pretend that everyone rolled a separate defense roll and everyone magically got a 12, okay?).<br/><br/>Because the roll represents both resolution success and resolution order, Carrie goes first and "wins" her goal. She tosses the hammer into the pit.<br/>Adam goes next. He can't kill Bob with the hammer. The question the rules must resolve is, can Adam still kill Bob without the hammer? Let's say no. His goal is now invalid. Now the rules must determine what concession is made to Adam, if any. Maybe he just loses. Maybe he gets a new action or some meta points.<br/>Bob goes last. He succeeded, too, so Carrie gets shoved into the pit.<br/><br/><b>Example 2:</b><br/><br/>If the rolls had been different, or if we separated success from order somehow, or if the defense rolls had been different, the outcome could vary. Here's another using the same goals.<br/><br/>Adam wants to kill Bob with the hammer. Adam rolls a 15 vs. Bob's defense of 13. He secretly spends 3 tokens for initiative.<br/>Bob wants to push Carrie into the pit. Bob rolls a 20 vs. Carrie's defense of 17. He secretly spends 2 tokens for initiative.<br/>Carrie wants take the hammer from Adam and throw it down the pit. Adam's defense is 10. She secretly spends 2 tokens for initiative.<br/><br/>Adam goes first. He succeeds. He kills Bob. Dead.<br/>Bob goes next (let's say token ties are broken by the roll). He's dead. He doesn't get to go.<br/>Carrie goes last. She takes the hammer from Adam and tosses it in the pit, but too late for Bob.<br/><br/>Again, if initiative had gone differently, Bob might still be alive. <br/><br/>All you have to do is let the fiction invalidate goals as play is resolved: orthogonal conflicts, voila! This requires a system that determines who goes in what order and who wins each of the goals. <br/><br/>This is all IIEE stuff: initiation, intent, execution, effect. Another term to look up on the Forge, probably, or we can discuss it here.

Not bad results, it just hasn't matched well with the fiction we were creating and the handling time seemed like an obstacle. Although systems where you choose your initiative from the same resource pool or results that you choose how effective you are (potentially sacrificing one for the other) aren't as bad as where initiative and effectiveness are separate.

It combines order and success in the same system. Lemme see if I can do this without referencing the rules. Someone correct me if I get any bits wrong.<br><br>Vincent calls each resolution mini-turn a "go" and each full turn a "round." Each round, every player gets a go.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in order of the two highest dice in a player's pool (assuming the player hasn't already had a go this round. That is, everyone rolls a bunch of dice and the two highest in each player's pool determine who goes first. Then a player pushes two dice (maybe different dice) forward (a "raise") and explains what is happening in the fiction. Anyone who must answer ("see") that action need to spend dice that meet or exceed the main player's two dice.<br/><br/>Then it's the next person's "go." What's cool here is that the turn order is <i>recomputed</i>. People who already had a go this round are left out of the equation. Everyone who hasn't had a go yet looks at his or her remaining dice and whoever has the two highest dice is the next to go. So maybe you started with 7, 6, 6, 4 and answered a raise of 12 with your 7+5, and now you have 6+6 to determine if you go next. <br/><br/>During play, people I've gamed with rarely optimize their tactics to win initiative, though, but the rules are there to make the IIEE clear as day. It really doesn't get in the way of play, either.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176698/#Comment_176698" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T10:46:03+00:00" title="October 29, 2008 10:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2008 10:47AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Adam.<br/><br/>A great illustration of the concept at work.<br/><br/>Question: Could Sorcerer-style resolution coexist with preset stakes?

As I see it, Dogs' mechanics combine effectiveness, initiative, and hit points all in one groovy package: your dice tell you how fast and well you can do something, and you're out of the fight when you run out of dice. (And, of course, you can do certain things to get more dice in the middle of the conflict.) <br/><br/>I'd never realized the implications that Raising with your highest dice means you're potentially giving up initiative in future rounds!<br/><br/>Point of clarification: In Dogs, everyone gets a "go", right? It's not like IaWA where you don't get a go if you See a Raise. Is that right?<br/><br/>[Edit: One more question: If three or more people are involved in a conflict, when someone Gives, does it mean that there just out of the conflict, or does it have other consequences, like someone's Stakes happening? Can we play out the situation you posted above with simplified Dogs-y mechanics?]<br/><br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Can you give an example of how Sorcerer-style ordering and success can fall flat for you in play?

Every player who hasn't Given gets a go in each round. You get a Raise even if you had a See. If you Give, you're out of the conflict, and you have allowed their stakes to come to fruition. <br><br>I don't recall the rules being clear on giving when you and another player are opposing someone's stakes. For example, Steward Sinister wants to kill the little boy he married. Two Dogs, Brother Bobias and Sister Carriette want to stop him. If Carriette gives, does Sinister kill the boy? or do both Bobias and Carriette have to give?<br><br>Either could make sense. <br><br>Okay, here's an attempt at the "hammer" (now a shotgun) example with Dogsy mechanics:<br><br>Brother Adam wants to kill Bob with the shotgun. <br/>Brother Bob wants to push Carrie into the outhouse and lock it. <br/>Sister Carrie wants take the shotgun from Adam and throw it into the well.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. Conflicts tend to be larger than that. So the GM says, "Okay, it looks like this conflict is about whether Bob dies or not. Cool?" Everyone agrees.<br/><br/><b>Start</b><br/><br/>Adam is shooting. He rolls a pile of d6es for his Acuity + Will. Let's say he gets: 6 6 5 4 3 1.<br/>Bob is fighting. He rolls a pile of d6es for his Will + Body. Let's say he gets: 6 5 4 3 3 2 1 1.<br/>Carrie isn't quite fighting; let's call it physical. She rolls a pile of d6es for her Body + Heart. Let's say she gets: 5 5 5 4 4 3 2 1.<br/><br/>For simplicity, no relationship dice, but that's where you'd roll them in, before determining whose Go it is.<br/><br/><b>Round 1</b><br/><br/>Determine who Goes first. Adam has 6 6, which beats everyone else's highest pair. He goes first.<br/><br/><b>Round 1 -- Adam's Go</b><br/>Now he can pull in more dice, too, for his gun and his Traits and all that stuff. But let's not, to keep this simple. <br/><br/>Adam has the highest pair (6 6) and goes first. He says, "I draw my shotgun and shoot Bob right in the face. Pow! You're either with the Dogs or you're against the Dogs!" He Raises 6+6 = 12.<br/>Bob and Carrie both want to stop that. Doesn't matter what order they go in since neither can block it, but really, Bob has the next higher pair, so he should See first. Bob and Carrie could bring in more dice here for Traits and Equipment and stuff, too, but let's not.<br/>Bob can't see 12 with two dice so he uses more and Takes the Blow, saying, "Damn!  Gunshot peppers my face and I reel backwards." He Sees with 3+3+2+1 and takes 4d10 (shooting) Fallout.<br/>Carrie can't see 12 with two dice and has to Take the Blow. "Argh! I leap towards Adam to snatch the gun away, but it goes off before I get there, and I slide through the mud empty-handed." She Sees with 5+4+3 and takes 3d6 (physical) Fallout.<br/><br/>That was Adam's Go. Now we look at remaining dice to see who Goes next.<br/>Adam has 5 4 3 1, but he has already Gone. Bob has 6 5 4 1. Carrie has 5 5 4 2 1. Bob Goes next.<br/><br/><b>Round 1 -- Bob's Go</b><br/>Bob Raises with 6+5=11. "I grab Carrie by one leg and one arm and heave her into the outhouse and then lock it!"<br/>Carrie must see that. Adam doesn't have to unless he wants to stop that from happening.<br/>Carrie Sees with 5+5+1=11, Taking the Blow. "Fwump! I go unceremoniously head over turnpike into the smelly little building. 'Crap!' I shout." Carrie takes 3d8 (fighting) Fallout.<br/><br/>Everyone but Carrie has had a Go. It's hers now.<br/><br/><b>Round 1 -- Carrie's Go</b><br/><br/>Carrie has 4 2 left. She Raises 4+2=6. "I kick my way out of the outhouse, smashing down the door, and snatching away Brother Adam's shotgun and tossing it down the well."<br/>Bob can see if he wants, but it's to his benefit to disarm Adam. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't really have dice left anyway.<br/>Adam has to See it. He Sees with 5+1=6, a Block or Dodge. "Ha! I step out of the way at the last second and spin my gun out of your reach. 'Not this time, Sister.'"<br/><br/>Now it's Round 2. Whoever has the two highest (unused) dice has the first Go. <br/><br/>Remember, in a real Dogs game, everyone is bringing in more dice for Traits and Equipment, or Escalating to a different type of conflict to get additional dice from Attributes that haven't been used yet. These dice come in after figuring out whose Go it is, technically, but in my games, players seem to roll in their extra dice whenever, willy-nilly, ignoring that bit of the ordering rules. I should be more strict about it. We also tend to freeform the order of who Sees when.<br/><br/>Now, whether or not it was kosher for Carrie to bust out of the outhouse (it sorta undoes Bob's action, right?) is up to the group. <br/>If Carrie managed to snatch Adam's gun, it doesn't necessarily stop him from killing Bob, either. He could choke Bob to death, steal the gun back, or find a gun laying in the street. A very strict and discerning group of players might disallow all those things based on the <i>spirit</i> of Carrie's action, but the rules (as far as I recall) don't really say that you should play this way. Generally, it's all good. Make stuff up. <br/><br/>Whew.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176720/#Comment_176720" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T14:04:14+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  2:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2008 2:04PM by jenskot.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I don't recall the rules being clear on giving when you and another player are opposing someone's stakes.

This may be my fault: I'll try to clarify.<br/><br/>My focus here (<i>here = in this thread</i>) is not "how do we order actions in a conflict" or "who succeeds and who fails in their actions". It's about how this sort of thing interfaces with intentions. It's kind of a task resolution vs. conflict resolution thing. (And I hesitate to write that, since the line between the two is kinda blurry in some of these systems. Let's not argue about definitions, OK?) So, my point of interest: at the end of the conflict, who has achieved their goals and who has failed?<br/><br/>So, in the Dogs example, am I right if I say:<br/><br/>* If Bob Gives or runs out of dice, then he is dead. This is the only condition necessary for his death, and also guarantees his death.<br/>* If Carrie and Adam BOTH Give or run out of dice, then Bob is still alive.<br/><br/>And, further, if Carrie's intent had been to stop Adam from killing Bob <i>by killing him</i>, would it look like this?<br/><br/>* Both Bob and Carrie have to Give or run out of dice for Bob to die.<br/>* If Adam Gives or runs out of dice, then he is dead and Bob is still alive.<br/>* If Carrie Gives first, then Adam will survive (unless Fallout kills him).<br/>* Or is Carrie's intent two different things (to save Bob and to kill Adam), and thus not a legal intent? In this case, if Bob Gives first, he is dead, and the conflict carries on between Carrie and Adam, to find out whether she kills him Adam or not.<br/><br/>Or would that simply not be a workable situation in Dogs?<br/><br/>My main curiosity is about how procedures like the Sorcerer or IaWA conflicts (which are task-based, in terms of individual actions, and don't have "stakes", per se) can or cannot be applied in a system that does use stakes. My question is about outcomes and a resolution of a conflict, not about how to order actions or how to distinguish orthogonal from opposed.<br/><br/>Dogs, Sorcerer, and IaWA are still handling the final outcome based on some variation of "hit points": in Sorcerer and IaWA, you can only really get your way by incapacitating or killing your opponent. Otherwise, they're free to keep struggling--the conflict is not necessarily resolved. Dogs sounds kind of like a situation where each player can contribute dice to defend or push towards a particular goal (which is a resolution of the Stakes), and needs to force opponents out of the conflict in order to win those stakes.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear more about how Shock: handles this sort of thing, also.<br/><br/>Thank you all again for all the help so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176733/#Comment_176733" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T15:47:07+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  3:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Shock:<br/><br/>We each say what our character's trying to accomplish.

Let's say that we each roll 5 dice (in Shock: it's a variable number). My d10s count toward my character's intention, my d4s count against your character's intention. So when I choose dice, I weigh how badly I want my character to achieve her intentions against how badly I want your character to NOT. I have to choose at least one d10, but my other four dice can be any mix of d10s and d4s. If I don't mind your character achieving her intention, I choose all d10s; if I'd rather sacrifice my own character's success to stop yours, I'll choose 1d10 and 4d4.<br/><br/>We roll!

Basically, everyone has a stake, and everyone rolls. Winner gets narration rights and their stake. If there are orthogonal stakes involved, it's up to the winner to decide wether or not those happen. However, there is another one who has a say (how this person is decided is not important). This person gets to add a fact before the narration. The fact cannot contradict the stake that was set, but it CAN deal with one of the orthogonal stakes, making the winner not have control over this in narration. The winner then narrates, and includes both their stake and the fact in the narration.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?

It might approach what you're looking for, since it uses Sorcerer's way of full or reduced defense and IAWA's damage-or-negotiation system.  So it doesn't completely solve your "able to keep struggling" problem, but potentially, you can negotiate outcomes for each roll and thereby constantly resolve things.<br/><br/>Other than that, you'd need to design something with the ability to allocate resources or otherwise prioritize, have a basic difficulty for the conflict for success so that everyone can fail absent opposition, then allow the allocation to make this more difficult for other players.  I can't think of any specific system that does this out of the box, but several of those mentioned can probably be modified to fit that mold.  That should be rather easy.  <br/><br/>For example, give players a pool of dice.  They can allocate them to their own or other people's goals.  When you roll, the highest one counts.  Say it's D10s, and you need at least a 3 or the highest opposition die, whichever is higher, to succeed.  So if you focus completely on your own goal, it's easy to make it if it's unopposed, but if you spread yourself thin you could lose that one as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176787/#Comment_176787" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T09:39:01+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  9:39AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool! Thanks for all the suggestions. I'll be checking those out.<br/><br/>Here are my concerns with systems like the one described in Shock:--although, keep in mind I've never read or played Shock:, so I may be getting something wrong.<br/><br/>* If you're allocating a d4 and a d10, that means you have no chance to stop two other people, right? So, like, if Bob wants to shoot Mary, and Ted and Joe both want to stop him, there is absolutely no way that he could shoot her. Is that right?<br/><br/>* This could be solved, in theory, by having a more finely-grained approach. Instead of just two dice, you might have six, and you can allocate them however you like--say, two to shoot Mary, two to keep Ted away, and two to keep Joe away.<br/><br/>That's getting pretty fiddly, though (depending on the system--how would you do that in Fate/SotC, for example?). In any case, I see more potential problems:<br/><br/>Let's say my goal is to escape from prison. Your goal is to catch me and keep me in prison. As I understand the Shock: method, we have two rolls: one to see if you get your goal (which I can oppose with a die) and one to see if I get mine (which you can oppose with a die). You see the problem I hope: what happens if we both win? What happens if we both lose? What does it mean if you stop me from escaping but do not manage to catch me and keep me in prison?<br/><br/>Now, I know some fun stuff can be done in those situations, like having the situation change dramatically, funny misunderstandings, etc. And you could also say that in that particular example (escaping from prison) only one player has a meaningful goal, and the other is just trying to stop him. But, again, as far as I can tell, all that sort of thing gets really muddled once you have three or more sides involved in the contest.<br/><br/>Or am I missing something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176794/#Comment_176794" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T10:20:15+00:00" title="October 30, 2008 10:20AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2008 10:22AM by lumpley.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all design questions (not "concerns").

By "concerns" I did mean design questions. I'm looking to get a handle on the various possibilities for design. But I'm not finding the questions you listed "easy". Although it may be because we're also discussing a system I'm completely unfamiliar with.<br/><br/>What I'm seeing so far, though (and this might be due to my own thick-headedness or lack of insight), is that all these systems either:<br/><br/>a) impose strict limitations on the types of intents that are possible (only orthogonal, only opposed, etc), or<br/>b) use some kind of hit point-type mechanic that's either based on character effectiveness for future conflicts or determines when a character is "out of the fight"<br/><br/>In all this discussion, I'm just trying to get a handle on all these variables so that I can fully understand the options available to me as a designer. I hope I'm not getting on anyone's nerves--I certainly don't intend to, if that's the case!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176853/#Comment_176853" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T06:56:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  6:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2008 7:00AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>I merged Sorcerer, Agon, Dogs and IAWA<a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=14" rel="nofollow">in this one-page system</a>. </blockquote>\nHey, this is very cool!

I'll tell you my answers. Here's how I'd design these resolution rules.<br/><br/>In conflict, everybody rolls 5 dice. (This is a placeholder number; real development would change it or solidify it, and let's also flag it as a possible candidate for stats.)<br/><br/>Pre. Everybody has a 3x5 card on the table in front of them, marked with die-sized boxes labeled with the names of the other players. In the center is a die-sized box labeled "me!" Everybody has their own. Maybe it's part of their character sheet.<br/><br/>1. Everybody says what their characters are trying to accomplish (with implicit or explicit character actions attached). This is your <i>primary intent</i>. Your primary intent can be orthogonal to everyone else's, or else it can directly oppose or directly support someone else's. Either way, you'll get the chance to oppose anyone else or everyone else. You don't have to say who you're going to oppose, but you can.<br/><br/>This is free &amp; clear: if you have to go around the table a couple of times before everyone's primary intent is settled, that's fine.<br/><br/>2. Everybody chooses 5 dice. Choose all d10s, all d4s, or a mix of d10s and d4s.<br/><br/>* d10s go toward your primary intent, ONLY IF your primary intent is orthogonal to everyone else's. And, if your primary intent is orthogonal to everyone else's, you have to choose at least one d10.<br/><br/>* d4s go toward supporting and/or opposing others' primary intents. If your primary intent is to support or oppose someone else's, you must choose all d4s.<br/><br/>Chosing your dice means prioritizing your primary intent vs supporting and opposing others'.<br/><br/>3. Everybody rolls their dice.<br/><br/>4. Everybody looks at their dice and arranges them on their card. Put your highest d10 (if any) in the box labeled "me!" Put your d4s (if any) in the boxes of the players whose primary intents you want to support or oppose. Prioritize them by assigning higher dice to the ones you want to support and oppose more. Any dice you don't assign, set aside.<br/><br/>Do this without table talk, without refering to anyone else's dice or cards. Make your own decisions for your own character.<br/><br/>5. Resolve! When it's your turn, put forward your d10, and your supporters and opponents put forward the d4s they've assigned to you. Supporters on one side, opponents on the other. Let's look at the dice in descending d10 order (with unused d10s breaking ties), but let's <i>resolve</i> in a sort of free &amp; clear afterward. Everything that the dice say happens, happens, and it's up to us to figure out what order makes sense for them to happen in.<br/><br/>Anyhow, your success level equals your d10 plus your supporters' d4s minus your opponents' d4s:<br/>11 or more: massive group success.<br/>7-10: wicked good success.<br/>4-6: success.<br/>1-3: failure.<br/>less than 1: bad failure.<br/>For primary intents with binary succeed/fail, 4+ is a success, 3 or less is a failure.<br/><br/>People who are exclusively supporting and opposing don't have d10s, so they don't get a success level of their own, of course.<br/><br/>So here's an example in action. You, playing Paula; me, playing Vicky; Mitch, playing Michelle.<br/><br/>Me: Vicky's going to shoot Paula.<br/>You: Paula's going to jump out the window and run away.<br/>Mitch: Michelle's going to shoot Vicky.<br/><br/>We each choose 5 dice.<br/><br/>* I really don't want either Paula to get away or Michelle to shoot Vicky, so I choose 1d10 4d4.<br/>* You want Paula to get away without getting shot, but you have to prioritize, so you choose 2d10 3d4.<br/>* Mitch doesn't care whether Vicky shoots Paula or whether Paula gets away, so he chooses 5d10.<br/><br/>We roll and assign.<br/><br/>* I get 7 and 1 1 2 3. I assign 7 to my primary intent, 3 to Mitch, and 2 to you.<br/>* You get 2 4 9 and 3 3. You assign 9 to your primary intent, 3 to me, and 3 Mitch, as support.<br/>* Mitch gets 1 1 1 3 5 (sad!). He assigns 5 to his primary intent, with a pout.<br/><br/>We reveal and resolve.<br/><br/>We look at your dice first. You have a 9 and I'm opposing you with a 2, so your success level is 7, wicked good success. Paula will get out the window and away.<br/><br/>We look at my dice next. I have a 7 and you're opposing me with a 3, so my success level is 4, success. Vicky will shoot Paula.<br/><br/>And finally we look at Mitch's dice. He has a 5, I'm opposing him with a 3, and you're supporting him with a 3, so his success level is 5, success. Michelle will shoot Vicky.<br/><br/>Easy to figure out what order things happen in. Paula dives for the window. Vicky shoots her, but not hard enough to keep her from getting away. The distraction gives Michelle a good shot at Vicky, though. Dive! Bam! Run! Bam!<br/><br/>So there you go. That's how I'd adapt Shock: to multi-way conflicts, if it were me.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177163/#Comment_177163" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T10:42:12+00:00" title="November  3, 2008 10:42AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Vincent!

I'm getting a much better handle on all this stuff now, and the options available.<br/><br/>For instance, some interesting features of what you've outlined:<br/><br/>* Oppositional intents are really just penalties to someone else's intent. That keeps us from needing to order actions.<br/>* In fact, we *cannot* order actions in this system. We need to figure out how things happened afterwards for them to make sense. For instance, we cannot resolve the matter of Paula jumping out the window (in the fiction) until we know whether she's been shot or not. <br/>* There's a possibility of stalemates or "whiffs", which could mean we'd need some kind of option for future rounds: one roll is not guaranteed to resolve the conflict of interests.<br/><br/>But I'm seeing all these as options now, as opposed to limitations or dead-ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177199/#Comment_177199" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T13:50:01+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  1:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
