I've been tinkering with it quite a bit, trying to achieve Story Now, and so far I've not met with success.<br/><br/>Here's my latest idea: at any time, a player may opt to make an \u201coffering\u201d of some advantage or ally in play \u2013 the asset is lost in some way, and in exchange the player gets to automatically succeed on a roll, no questions asked Example: I was supposed to keep an eye on this woman for my commanding officer, but then I get called away by the villagers for some damn thing. I want to succeed on my Repair check or whatever to help them, so I tell the GM \u201cHey, I'm gonna let that woman run away. She's my Offering for my Repair check.\u201d Bang, instant success. <br/><br/>There are two other things you can do with an offering:<br/>1- you can turn a regular d6 (succeeds on 5 or 6) into an orange Hubris d6 (succeeds on 4-6) but if you end up with a skill whose pool is more than half orange, you can only do evil or selfish things with it.<br/>2 \u2013 you can turn a regular d6 into a green Aegis d6 (succeeds on 3-6), but if you have a majority of green dice in a skill pool, you can only do the gods' work with it.<br/><br/>If you try to go outside this limitation, all colored dice are removed. So, if I put a lot of Hubris into my Spear-Fighting skill, and then try to use it to actually help somebody, instead of wreaking vengeance or making myself look good, all my special orange dice get stripped out of it \u2013 it's a little like alignment, I guess, in that it's going against my nature, a nature I've been consciously crafting through play. <br/><br/>My problem is: that bit about the gods' work? What is that, exactly? I feel like I'm making a lot more work for myself by having to devise the gods' work, and then tie it into the story. It occurred to me to consider the gods' reaction to the players' kickers, but I got stuck with the Greek gods and what they might actually want from mortals. I came up with consorts, nemeses (to fulfill some divine vengeance), champions, and priests. With that, though, it feels more and more like I should just go play Hero Quest (the RPG, that is), and stop pulling my hair out over my choice to make the game set in mythological Greece.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>Damn Olympians.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214428/#Comment_214428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T18:33:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  6:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like your process might be a little backwards.

Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter so the winds will blow east across the Aegean, and the Greeks can sail to Troy. Or a huntsman falls afoul of an amorous nymph, and when he rebuffs her advances, she turns his wife into a stag, and he unknowingly kills and butchers his wife in the forest. Or Achilles is held by his heel in a sacred-herb fire, granting him immortality; only when he defiles a temple of Apollo at Troy do the gods decide they've had enough of him. <br/><br/>HiQ,<br/>Are they spent as a finite resource? That sounds neat. <br/><br/>Shreyas,<br/>My thinking was that one might be the "favored of the gods" or something. I suppose I was trying to give some meat to the option of "serving the gods". In this particular case, I was thinking it should be tougher to either rely only on one's human aptitude (lose the green) or conduct oneself with dignity and restraint (lose the orange) - the more you rely on this kind of thing as a crutch, the more difficult it is to do without it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214454/#Comment_214454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T22:28:59+00:00" title="June 25, 2009 10:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like how Hubris is predictable. It should be a chancetaking. Like, the more Hubris dice you get, the cooler you look (the better you succeed), but at some point you can't predict (like when all of your successes are from Hubris dice, or when all your none-Hubris dice come out as ones or something), the gods will think you're too much and come down to teach you a lesson.<br/><br/>My image of the gods matches that of Shreyas. Also, unless the player decides the will of the gods somehow, the Aegis dice are messing a lot with the player agency, which I recall you being a fan of. But they can work a bit like what I suggested above. So when you have bunch of Aegis dice and something happens (like all your normal dice come out as ones and the highest single die is an Aegis die) the gods will not teach you a lesson, like with the Hubris dice, but rather demand something of you. Maybe it's a quest or maybe it's just a huge sacrifice, like sacrificing your daughter. If you don't comply, they will screw you over, like making the wind blow west so you can't sail to Troy. Seers and such are great for communicating the will of the gods this way, since the gods might not always want to come personally to screw you over.<br/><br/>So basically, Hubris dice and Aegis dice will both be good to have, but the more you have them, the more the gods will intervene and make your life miserable.

I've heard people allude good things about that game. As in, I have no frame of reference for them, but it's built up a mystique in my head.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>: That sounds an awful lot like what I was shooting for! Good stuff. I see no reason why the gods can't directly visit the heroes, which would do away with a lot of the guesswork.<br/><br/>"like when all of your successes are from Hubris dice, or when all your none-Hubris dice come out as ones or something" - - awesome. I love it. I have, thus far, steered clear of actually doing much with the dice themselves. But a little index card or something with "hey, if THIS happens..." would be an easy way to get around my fear of high handling time or poring over tables or rules.<br/><br/>Here's what I'm thinking - roll the dice. If your only successes come from Aegis dice, might be the gods come knocking and say "we did that. You owe us". More or less what you said, but with a twist: the player can say "I fail", and keep the gods off his back; no divine favors owed the gods, after all.<br/>For Hubris, I had plans for a five-point system, in which Hubris Effects ranged from "bread will not rise in your house" to "your life's works are overturned". I recently grouped most skills into four groups: Oikos (Household; family, slaves and property), Polis (City-State; friends, contacts, colleagues, and first impressions), Battle-Throng (weapon skills), and Wilderness (riding, sailing, and survival skills). <br/><br/>So, with the Offering mechanic I mentioned above, it works like this - if you want a) automatic success AND b) a little extra edge for next time (a green or orange die, that is), you do that, and you, I dunno, do something related to either Hubris or Aegis. Under Oikos, there's a skill called Blood Ties - it's how much loyalty you command in your family, your slaves, and your servants. If you beef it up with Hubris, that comes from screaming at your wife, or beating your slaves; the loyalty derives from their fear of you. If you beef it up with Aegis, it comes from being a respectable husband and land-owner, and receiving that respect.<br/><br/>Now, if we introduce your idea about white-dice botches, then you have Hubris moments where the Furies show up because you've done something really awful to your son, and you have Aegis moments where Aphrodite comes to tell you that the old witch-woman's love potion was really *her* doing, and you owe it to *her* that your wife has started making love to you again. <br/><br/>I think that the benefits you derive from taking on Aegis or Hubris should focus on your mortal life, and the divine consequences *of* those colorful dice should drive a wedge in your petty, human plans.

Hubris as a legal concept was the equivalent of assault and battery - you attack another citizen in public, for instance.<br/>As a concept, it means crossing a very firm line - the Furies went after kin-slayers, child-killers, and spouse-killers, driving them mad. The gods themselves pretty much blasted, shot, and smashed to bits anyone who got in their way, who didn't honor them properly, or what-have-you. <br/><br/>Of course, this begs the question: what do Hubris dice represent? Josh is right; the original concept doesn't have anything to do with selfishness per se. Your typical hero, being half-divine, was a wandering exile, kicked out of his hometown for murder, whose rapine, slaughter, and piracy were considered heroic so long as they were against some <i>other</i> tribe that the storyteller's audience didn't like. I think I need to incorporate Greek gender roles and social expectations more; the gods encourage (and do) some highly fucked up things, and their chosen heroes are very, very far from being nice people. Heracles went mad and killed his family at one point; Achilles withdrew his men from combat at Troy because Agamemnon laid claim to a slave girl that he liked; Jason promised to love and honor Medea, and then stranded her on a desert island to get out of his commitment (to be fair, Jason was one of the milder Greek heroes, along with Orpheus in that respect). <br/><br/>I could see Hubris being a PC's sense of horror at the divine will, or maybe when he balks at what he's asked to do, like when the ancient Hebrews sometimes balked (no doubt) at slaughtering entire rival tribes. Following the Greek gods' will is, on some level, comparable to extremely militant, misogynistic nationalism. Those of us who are more comfortable with the democracy and the symposia of ancient Greece will, necessarily, draw contrast between ourselves and, say, Heracles, or the centaurs, or, ugh, Dionysus and his sheep-eating orgiastic cultists. And, wow, don't even get me started on Greek educational pederasty and all the weird rules of conduct contained therein. <br/><br/>Still, ancient Greek virtues weren't totally alien, and in fact there were some holdovers all the way into the chivalric code (like the approach to generosity and largesse): <i>"Aristotle lists the following as moral virtues: courage, temperance (moderation), liberality (moderation in giving and taking money), magnificence (correctly dealing with great wealth or power), pride (claiming what is due to you), gentleness (moderation with respect to anger), agreeableness, truthfulness, and wit."</i> [from wikipedia.org, "Nicomachean Ethics"]<br/><br/>The four classical virtues are prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. Given that the Romans considered "respect for the natural order" (take that as you will) as a civic virtue, the classical definition of "justice" is, no doubt, a little different from ours. One thing they did have that we don't, generally, is a big focus on moderation. I find that fascinating. <br/><br/>One last thing: glory is granted when the hero does something awesome. I'm keeping that as morally neutral as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214580/#Comment_214580" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:19:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could do it as a DitV-type anti-game: the best tactic in the game is to be a misogynistic asshole.

Could that be a chance to reverse the trend, and, say, turn an orange or green die into a white one?<br/><br/>Another thought: if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">successfully</span> do something really awesome and creative, the GM awards you a Glory point. You can cash in your Glory points for two dice a pop (good for one roll; there's more to that, if you need it), and these dice are, well, Mortal. Thus, Glory definitely reflects great things, things that <i>you</i> have done, not the gods, and thus the odds of succumbing to Aegis or Hubris on a given roll are a good deal lower if you pop a couple of plain white dice in there. Additionally, Glory points can be spent on permanent stat or skill increases, at the rate of 2 Glory for 1 trait-point. Finally, whenever you <i>attempt</i> something awesome, creative, etc., the GM should give you up to 2 more white dice on your roll. <br/><br/>Overall, all the ways to gain more dice provide a good way to give yourself more control of your fate, at the expense of the highest-level effectiveness possible. If you give over all your dice to Aegis as quickly as possible, you're going to be visited by the gods left and right, and your fate will not be your own. <br/><br/>At this point, I want to think a bit more about how to tie the gods into a play-situation; I imagine that whatever would displease them would certainly arise directly from that. Question is, how do you turn Mortal dice into Hubris dice? I like the Offering idea. <br/><br/>My concern is this: I want the group to be fairly able to come up with cool *reasons* for the gods to come after you, if and when your Hubris-tinged skill comes up with only orange successes. Hey, maybe not - maybe those orange moments are just a negative visitation from the divine.<br/><br/>These things would probably be resolved well through play. Also - - I'm starting to get the vibe that this could work better with fewer players, not more; I wonder how an Argonauts situation would feel, with all those Visitations and Smitings and so on, happening all over the place?<br/><br/>One more thought: you can't gain more dice through Hubris or Aegis. You have to step up and be awesome to actually expand. Green and orange can max out the effectiveness of what you do have, but they will never get you *more* dice. Something to think about, I guess - the gods' best hope is someone who doesn't always need their help, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214987/#Comment_214987" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T02:24:24+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  2:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while back I wrote a game named 10.000 and it may interest you, but as it is written in french I'll sum up the more important rules here :<br/><br/>It was (loosely) based on Xenophon's Anabasis : 10.000 greek mercenaries find themselves trapped in the middle of the Persian Empire and try to get home.<br/><br/>In the game setting, I had the mercenaries kill their Oracle ("<i>He promised us victory and now we're fucked !</i>").

"Short cutting" by taking on Aegis or Hubris will make the dice you already have more effective, but there's a chance the gods will come crashing into your life when you (the character) really don't want them there. <br/>I just read <i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: the Black Dossier</i>; it has a story in it called "The Life of Orlando", and the Siege of Troy is mentioned: <br/><br/><i>"In Ilium, as Troy was then called... I first knew war, a conflict instigated by the gods to cull their hybrid byblows, the increasingly alarming ... unstable race of heroes."</i><br/><br/>That is an excellent mood-setting excerpt for <i>The Hellenes</i> - the more of a crutch you make Olympus, the more disastrous your life could become. <br/><br/>Originally, I had this idea for "add-on" dice, but I was going to key it to the activation of Virtues, like Justice and Courage. I like this idea more - it has less implicit value judgment in it, and I really want players to portray the kind of heroes that they want, not the ones I can think up for a book. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example Time!</span><br/>This version of add-on Glory could track the rising conflict rather nicely: future king David proves himself to his liege, King Saul, in a number of ways before they actually come to blows. The boy first draws attention to himself as the king's musician; then he bravely slays Goliath, earning Glory for himself. <br/><br/>Saul's daughter, Princess Michal, asks if she can marry David - Saul decides he could get rid of this upstart suitor, who's already stolen fame for himself, by telling him "You can marry my daughter if you return with the foreskins of 100 Philistines." David agrees, and returns some unclear period of time later with 200! Glory be! Michal, delighted, begins wedding preparations.<br/><br/>It's around this time that Saul, "playfully" thrusting a spear in David's direction, suddenly hurls it at him, meaning to kill! David dodges the weapon and flees with Michal into the hills. There, he assembles a loyal army and joins the Philistines to help conquer King Saul's lands. Eventually, they win (with the help of his Glory dice) and David is crowned king!<br/><br/>See, Josh, that's awesome. When you can pick out the story elements in a TV show or a film, and notice how they map the design of a familiar roleplaying game, that says you've "gotten it right" - that you can point to other kinds of narrative and say "I captured the essence of this!" Nicely done. I had a similar experience thinking about the <i>Firefly</i> episode "Out of Gas", and pondered how Hubris would fit in to how the ship suddenly burned up in the middle of nowhere. It made me think "hey, that's a good idea, with the Aegis and Hubris being 'checked' like that", (Simon's idea) and both of these new elements of the design make me feel like the game is really coming together! <br/>Yeah!<br/><br/>EDIT: My comic book about the Bible (<i>Cartoon History of the Universe, Vol. 1</i>) doesn't really cover *how* David, Maker of Eunuchs, goes about convincing the Philistines to work with him against King Saul. Maybe, given that Israel was still a fairly upstart nation at this point, the Philistine King figured "Better the slayer of Goliath, Foreskin-Stealer, works <i>for</i> us than against us!" Neat to explore that whole situation more, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Now I'm thinking that's still true, but given the more prominent, immediate use for Glory now, the timing of that expenditure is crucial.<br/>I'm thinking someone with not a lot of Sailing is trying to reach an island where a hero of Poseidon has sequestered himself. There's this storm, see, and he could really use the help, so he burns 2 Glory to up his Sailing by a point. <br/>Not too much, of course - spending 4 Glory just to get through this storm in one piece would put him at an awful disadvantage for the upcoming fight.<br/><br/>Ooh, I'm thinking that such a scenario (spending 2 vs. 4 Glory) could be parsed in the narration rather interestingly - if the player thinks it's a cool idea, the group could decide that 4 Glory meant the storm was so bad that they barely got through in one piece, and are now like drowned rats when the time comes to fight the Poseidonian.<br/><br/>I think it should be more efficient to use Glory to fight one's dire foes than to boost stats; that way it's a real trade-off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
