As I like to do while reading RPG, I imagined the <br/>kind of choices I could make if we are to create new characters (I do not know yet<br/>if we continue with the previous ones or not); and I had some feelings about the<br/>powers and races/classes that I would like to share.<br/><br/>Some of the powers are wicked cool, both in terms of technical effects in the game<br/>and in the background they provide; for example, I enterely based the concept<br/>of one of my previous characters on "Homonculus", providing it with a story around<br/>this power (this is related elswhere in this forum). But other powers seems dramatically<br/>weak, both as "powers" to act in play and as possible story extensions; for example:<br/>water breather. Other powers are potentially interesting, but described in such a way<br/>that they can appear at the same time, depending on the interpretation, either too weak/too<br/>specific or too powerful (Sky dancer).<br/><br/>Characters have has many powers as they have levels, and level 5 is the maximum of<br/>the game (at this level, characters should be legendary in the world). I therefore think that,<br/>given the small number of powers they can have (especially if, as me, you don't play that much),<br/>each one should truly be awesome and there shouldn't be "placeholders" (secondary powers<br/>you take after you have all the cool ones in your class). One way to achieve this is perhaps<br/>to design each power to have two roles:\n<ul><li>1) bringing story elements to the character<br/></li><li>2) giving him powerful capacities, with at least some description in terms of game stats<br/>(this helps the player and GM to decipher the extent of the power).<br/></li></ul>\nMoreover, all the powers should be of a similar efficiency (this is one of the principle<br/>of the game, since you can choose any power you want, whatever your level).<br/><br/>When I ponder these elements, I wonder what to make with "weak powers" such<br/>as Water breather. You might want your snake to be "racially" capable of breathing<br/>under water, and other races possibly to have similar small inhuman capacities. I then<br/>try and think about the races in DD and it occured to me that, whatever the edition<br/>of DD, there is a strong specificity about human and non-human races: human races<br/>do not have "special capacities", are quite basic in terms of initial stats (and saves, etc.),<br/>but they are versatile and can rise in power; non-human races begin with advantages<br/>(better saves, special capacities, etc.), but have otherwise stronger restriction (less<br/>versatility, do not progress as high as humans in terms of level, etc.). <br/><br/>There is perhaps a way to transcribe this in the RBH setting. One could for example<br/>give non-human races some small capacities (breath under water, etc.), with some<br/>additional drawbacks (more important that the basic - optional and without genuine<br/>effect in the game - drawback of each class). These additional non-human capacities would<br/>not appear as powers per se (avoiding the creation of two kinds of powers), but simple<br/>physical pecularities of the race, without stat effect in the game (no bonuses etc.: just<br/>avoid some maluses, for example).<br/><br/>These are very vague ideas and principles, perhaps not so good for the game, but I wanted<br/>to share these thoughts and see what other think about the powers of RBH<br/>(and dissymetries I feel in them).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177308/#Comment_177308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T15:27:06+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  3:27PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thanks for your feedback Jerome.</p>\n<p>In short: I agree.

This power does not provoke enough fun around the table.<br/></li><li> Mirrors: can you use it to spy on people, or do they have to "pick up" the "phone" so that the connection is established. In the first case, I keep it, in the second case, I change it so that it works as in the first case (!).<br/></li><li> Animus meal: I would change it to give a little bit more control on the transformation (not only use it as a trap to unaware people, but also as a possibility to transform volunteers - in particular, they could revert to their human form when wanted).<br/></li><li> Water breather: already talked about it.<br/></li><li> Frenzy: the only way to use this power is <i>put oneself in a non-wanted situation</i>: being cornered is not something one wants to, and I can't find an in-game explanation (as opposed to a pure player's choice) for a character to do that. Hence I would make the Fox able to enter into frenzy at will, with some drawback (in order that it does not become an automated bonus in each combat).<br/></li><li> Puppet strings, Conversational spirit, Crysta Augury, Rock music, Sky dance, Dream thief: to me, these powers can or are awesome, but deserve some precisions concerning their extent and possible game stat modifications.<br/></li></ul>\n<br/>I do not think Armor of scars should be dropped; but, as Mighty grip and a few other, they do not fit completely in my idea that each power should<br/><br/>1) be awesome in term of roleplay and possible uses in games<br/><br/>2) have a significant effect on game stats.<br/><br/>Armor of scar or Mighty grip satisfy 2), but not 1) (*), so I would simply change them so that they satisfy 1), using the fantasy background to help: why souldn't the Armor of scar be some kind of magical/physical transformation of the character (in another setting, think about Colossus in Xmen)?<br/><br/><br/>(*) one could argue that Mighty grip satisfies 1) in the sense that a BEAR wielding a TREE TRUNK as a weapon is awesome: yes, but the awesomeness comes mainly from the image of the bear, which is not part of the power per se.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177582/#Comment_177582" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T10:52:20+00:00" title="November  6, 2008 10:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Excellent.

I had the feeling that a level 1PC is a beginning adventurer while a level 5 PC, in RedBox Hack, is<br/>some kind of legend, threatening (or at least being acknowledged by) kings and such; Antoine believes that there are not so<br/>much difference between each levels of the game (a level 1 PC is already quite powerful, not necessarily because of its powers<br/>but because of the effects he can achieve thanks to the tokens).<br/><br/>My perception, mentioned above, of the powers in the game is driven by my perception of the levels: to pass from a<br/>"beginner" to a "legend" in 5 levels requires that each level gives a real boost to the player's capacities; hence the fact, in my<br/>view, each power should truly be awesome. But if the difference between the 5 levels is not so large, then each power does not need<br/>to be so important by itself.<br/><br/>I am interested in your vision on this subject, Eric. This will help me understand "how" to play RBH (having a coherent vision with<br/>the aims of the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177802/#Comment_177802" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T16:35:22+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  4:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The way I see it is a little closer to Antoine's version than to yours, Jerome.

It was specialy bad this time because the current game saw a lot of elements from the PC backstory come into play and we had the seeds for a future story. I realy regretted the death flag rules from the first edition of the game. It was a great game but a realy tragic one with an heroic but absurd death that places the surviving PC in the position of inheriting of his friend's agenda. We had a lot of actual emotion around the table as noboby, including myself the GM, wanted this death.<br/><br/>I'll open another thread for the actual play of this game but for now I'll react to the posts above.<br/><br/>About the conflict rules and the "dangers of action' : I usualy use them regularly during a game to introduce complications during the non-combat parts of the game. But this time I didn't use them much. In fact I mostly went with the "say yes" end of "say yes or roll the dice". I don't like to introduce the possibility of simply failing an action without changing the situation. So when I don't quickly come up with some interesting complication, I don't ask for dice and allow the action to succeed. That's what happened yesterday.<br/><br/>About the heroism issue, I have some things to add. I've always had the impressions from the rules that there was an equal part of hero and villain in the RBH characters. That's why it's my choice game for Faffrd and Gray Mouser or Conan like adventures. The main clue for this interpretration comes from the experience system. The PCs gain XP for killing monsters and stealing treasures. For me, that the two terms on the hero to villain scale.<br/>On the heroic side, you don't get xp for killing a harmless beast. You get xp for killing a creature that does bad things to people. You don't get XP for killing a dragon who only eats deers in the woods.<br/>On the villain side, you get xp for stealing a treasure that matters for people. And a treasure always matters for some people or it's not a worthy treasure.<br/>When I prep a game I have a lot more problems to find an interesting treasure than an interesting monster. And when I find an interesting treasure, It's usualy something that have so much value for the NPCs that the players don't choose to take it.<br/><br/>From my point of view, the treasure hunt part of the game is the part that needs most work now. First, I find that there's not enough mechanical incentive for the treasure (the xp value for a treasure pales before the xp value of a monster except for the legendary treasures). Second, I'd like more guides to come up with a valuable opposition to gain the treasure. Perhaps something in the vein of Agon or Beast Hunters points to buy adversity (no points left for the GM means you get the treasure) or something along the lines of D&amp;D 4E Skill challenges or Burning Empire's conflit scene. Basicaly I want to give treasure more value for the PCs but have better guides to come up with and appropriate opposition. Perhaps the game could start with the GM asking the players what kind of treasure they want to steal this time, the value of the treasure giving guidellines for the GM to create the opposition. I don't know exactly but I know I'd like to have some help from the rules for the treasure part.<br/><br/>That's a lot for now. I'll come back later with details with details on the powers and and the actual play report.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178017/#Comment_178017" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T11:05:20+00:00" title="November 10, 2008 11:05AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2008 11:05AM by Sean ov Newcastle !.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked the bit about the characters having to hang on to the treasure to get the xp - it meant the players felt less like giving the stolen idol back to the village and led to some heated debate amongst my gamers. As one of my players said, "If I'm going to battle a tomb full of monsters to get the treasure, I'm not gonna part with it for nothing or just to feel worthy after a job well done. Unless it's f**kin' cursed !"<br/><br/>Most of the time it was about the treasure being something vitally important to the characters that they would get off their arses and bring the mayhem for. <br/><br/>For me, RBH from the GMs point of view is about the triad of npcs/treasure/monsters - and because the monsterbuilding is fun it's easy to neglect the other 2/3 but having a balance enriches the gameplay. Major NPCs can act as the gatekeepers to information/equipment that will aid/block the players in finding the treasure/battling the monster and can test the morality of the PCs as much as the treasure by how they interact/negotiate etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178102/#Comment_178102" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T17:57:49+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  5:57PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I want to hear more about your reaction to the death rules.

It sufficed that I gained a few awesome tokens for my monster to bring J\xe9r\xf4me's PC, Alex, to 0 HP in one hit even with his Armor of scars power. And the end of the fight was with Marie's PC and the monster both at 1 HP... <br/><br/>Then we had the healing rolls. During this game J\xe9r\xf4me only made very loosy rolls outside of combat. So when it came to rolling the D12 we were all expecting something bad to happen. The first roll was a failure so Louise (Marie's PC) had to drag her comrad's body out of the forest and to a nearby village were they knew a healer. There J\xe9r\xf4me rolled the second D12 and failed again. The healer informed Louise that he couldn't do anything to save her friend. Marie didn't want that to happen, she asked me to change the rules or to make something miraculous happen like taking the body to the divine relic they had uncovered during he game. I said to her that I wanted to go by the rules because I think we need to see in a real situation with a PC we loved what is the effect they produce. So we went with the death. Very reluctantly.<br/>I felt something very strong. For me, Marie's PC became then the heir of Alex's (the dead PC) revenge because during the game, they had found informations concerning a sorcerer who had cursed Alex and his brother, forcing them to live in the same body. They were already planning an attack of the evil warlock fortress for the next game. <br/>So they came back to the nearby town and they put Alex into a grave near the aging demi-god lord of the town who also died because of the same monster. The town honored them both as heroes who had delivered them of the monsters. For me, it was a very moving moment. But I think it was very frustrating for J\xe9r\xf4me.<br/><br/>I don't know how to run the next game. I'd like Louise to go and beat the crap out of the sorcerer but I don't know what place J\xe9r\xf4me can have in this. It feels very unsatisfying to have him take a level 1 character to accompany Louise on her rampage. Too artificial.<br/>The only options I see are :<br/>- go with an idea that J\xe9r\xf4me sent by email : just before dying Alex could have separated one of the two brothers (using the homonculus power) and this one could be a new level 1 PC with very different powers but an even stronger motivation than before. This option would need to rewrite a bit the end of the game because we did not think of that at the moment. It would be someting that happened "out of camera".<br/>- if J\xe9r\xf4me don't want to "cheat" with what happened I'd prefer him to run the game as GM, playing the sorcerer and with me playing the newbie enrolled by Louise to help her. It could be great also, but I'd like to know what J\xe9r\xf4me and Marie think about that.<br/><br/>If we still had the rules from the first edition of the game, I am sure that the last fight would not have been to death. Jer\xf4me would have keep such an option for his fight with the sorcerer. I gave some thought to the death rules of the RBH1. I think that the 5XP bonus for fighting to death wasn't enough an incentive. I think that if a fight realy matters, a player could choose to fight for death when he hits 0HP. Then he could have an kind of energy surge, gaining some HP back but this time realy risking death at 0HP...<br/><br/>Still, it depends on what you want to do with PC death in your game, Eric. As it is now, it makes for a game where death is a tragic thing that can reap even a hero in his prime. It does not favor the execution of one PC agenda accross several games. But perhaps, it can creates strong bong between the PCs like I felt with the end of this game.<br/><br/>!!!!!!SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!! For those who know Dan Simmons' Carrion Comfort, I have the same kind of feeling as when the main character of the novel dies near the middle of the book leaving the other character to fight against the psychic vampires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178140/#Comment_178140" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T06:04:21+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  6:04AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thanks Antoine, I really appreciate your insight here.

Though I don't dislike exactly the same powers as you do.<br/><br/>For me the distinction is not between combat only powers and story powers but between powers that you can't forget you have because they give more option (in or out of combat) and powers you can forget or that limits your actions. And I would be sad to lose the combat options that some powers offer (like charger, two things at once, long shadow...).<br/><br/>For me Armor of scars is a good power : it goes well with the different incentives to fight without armor in the game, it works nice in combinations with powers like Homonculus or Long Shadow... When you have this power, you feel it very often.<br/><br/>On the other end I find Strategist almost too good at what it does. A PC with this power almost always use the Assist action. I would find better that the power alows you to do a free assist action after an attack, move or push. Without bonus. It would be like the difference between a old D&amp;D cleric and 4E cleric...<br/><br/>I have some issues since the first game we played with the enchant power. It's a power that we NEVER saw in play. Most of the time, Marie's weapon is just a +2 weapon and that's all. So last game I alowed Marie to use it to create on the fly specialist equipment. This way she could imagine objects to give a +2 bonus outside of combat with loose narative constraints. It was realy better. I think that fixes the talent.<br/><br/>Some kind of powers I'd like to see are powers that change the type of Arena. I can imagine a power for a bear or mystic that would allow him to change the terrain type by destroying or remodeling the scenery around him. It would work great with long shadow. It would also be usefull outside of combat to go out of prison or enter a place (in a non stealthy way though)...<br/><br/>As I said just random thoughts...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178144/#Comment_178144" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T06:19:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  6:19AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2008 6:19AM by Eric Provost.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>For what it's worth, Antoine, I think you and I are interpreting Enchanter differently.

I don't know why comments are so limited here, so I put them in two separate posts...<br/><br/>I gave lots of thoughts about the end of our adventure on sunday. There are two things to consider: reaching 0HP, and dying after that (failing the d12 rolls).<br/><br/>1) As Antoine explained, reaching 0HP can happen *very quickly* for PC if/when monsters have access to assist or show-off actions. Consider this: round 1, the monster makes a show-off action; round 2, he hits, using his tokens to increase the damages. Then consider two possibilities: the monster has some capacity for showing off (daring ~3-4), or the monster is very good at showing off (daring ~6-7); in the first case, with a medium result on the d12, he can gain 2 tokens: his hit on the 2nd round makes a PC lose 3HP, that's quite bad; in the second case, he can hope to have 3 tokens and thus put the PC at 1HP in one strike. With a little chance on the d12, add 1 token in each case: the "respectable" monster inflicts 4 HP of damage on the second round, while the "powerful" monster immediately puts down a PC. And that's without using any special power he has, just spending one round earning some tokens.<br/><br/>Of course, some lack of dice luck can ruin this series, but even if you consider adding one round if the monster misses on round 2, there remains some pretty good chances to put one PC down (without using powers) in 3 rounds. If the PC themselves use some rounds to earn tokens, they have little chance to kill the monster (with 10HP) before he can hit (and anyhow, this would make for a loosy action to absolutely have to kill the monster before he strikes one time); all the more as the monster's power can help him resist the PC. Besides, to make things safer and considering that it can last 3 rounds, the monster can decide to make two show off during the first two rounds, hence gaining the tokens necessary to ensure its strike on the 3rd round (and possibly even increase more its damage).<br/><br/>I don't remember all the dynamics of the fights in our game, but I believe the preceding situation was bearable because my PC precisely had Armor of scars: I think that, on several occasions, he took 3 or 4HP hits due to monster's tokens, but that it did not appear so terrible because of his 8HP; he perfectly played the role of protector in the group (taking the biggest hit so that Marie's character only had to endure hits not sustained with tokens).<br/><br/>This is not a big issue under the RBH1 death rules: as you said elsewhere, Eric, the monsters should be able to bring one PC down during the fight. But then, with the RBH2 death rules, reaching 0HP is not so benign since there's a chance that it marks the end of a story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerome" title="Jerome"><img alt="Jerome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jerome">Jerome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178216/#Comment_178216" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T14:33:38+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  2:33PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) Now, concerning what happened at the end of the game, I feel frustrated because one dice result marked a (near?) end to a story developed without the need/use of dice.<br/><br/>Here is how I broadly envision (and enjoy) most of the roleplaying I do: there is a story, and there are dices (in general, I am not fond of games without some randomness). You think about some story elements (related to the adventure you play or the backstory of a PC, whatever), you try to go there and, along the way, you bring some randomness; in doing so, the group (GM and PC) genuinely lives an adventure, having to react to things not planned by anyone, and re-direct the story accordingly.  The randomness should never stop the story: that's the "say yes or roll the dice" principle, with the understanding that a "roll the dice" should simply lead to two (or more) possible continuations of the story, not one continuation (on a "good roll") or the end of the story (on a "bad roll").<br/><br/>For the part of the story devoted to the GM, no random result can ever lead to the end of the story. A good dice result of a PC kills the monster during the first hour of play? No problem: the monster had a mother, or a master, to avenge it, or some people hear of the PC's exploit and look out for them (to kill them and gain some glory, to recruit them for some good/bad chores, etc.). A good dice result from the GM kills all the PC? No problem: bring in another bunch of PC and use the death of the preceding one to get the stakes of the story up higher. The GM has all the world's ressource at its disposal, so unless one dice result concern the total obliteration (not even "destruction" since it always remains some ashes after a "destruction") of the world, he cannot be lead to a dead-end by a dice.<br/><br/>For the part of the story devoted to the PC, this can be different. I feel that, if a player has brought some specific story elements through his PC, the death (or other kinds of definitive disparition) of the PC can mean, <i>for this particular player</i>, the end of the story (this does not mean that the GM or the other players cannot use the story elements brought by the dead PC to keep on going). Of course, it enterily depends on the situation and, sometimes, the death of the PC can, on the opposite, strengthen the story elements he created; but, in order that a death be meaningful to this story, it has to be decided by the player, not a dice. And that's what I feel happened sunday to me: a dice decided an outcome to my PC story which I do not at all feel in tune with; a dice ended, for me, this story. This does not mean that it is ended for Antoine and Marie: on the contrary, I<br/>very well understand how it can strengthen this story for them; but, right now, it feels a little weird for me to pick up this story again with a new<br/>character or as GM (and yet, I have some possible ideas...).<br/><br/>This being said, I come back to RBH and mollify a little what I implied at the end of 1): RBH2 death rules are not a problem per se. The principle "a<br/>monster should be able to bring down a PC during the fight" is a reasonnable one (though not easy to put into practice, this the equilibrium is not<br/>straightforward to find), since it is a way to ensure that the combats are not simply butchery from the PC, but really fun and living (no pun intented).<br/>However, this means that there a 6.25% chance per combat that a character dies (hence, after 5 combats for example, there is around 28%<br/>chance of PC loss). Players must simply take this into account when designing and playing their characters, expecting some turnover. This was not<br/>my case: I should not have given my PC a too specific backstory (with a named villain, a specific quest, etc.: I now feel frustrated that this story,<br/>which could have unfold itself during our games, is ended by a bad dice roll), and I should have re-read the rules to think on the spot, not 48h later,<br/>about what Antoine talked above (to my defense, my PC was created with RBH1, and I got carried away with the Homonculus power!).<br/><br/>Keeping this in mind, I do not take back what I said: the game IS fun, and I hope to read RBH3 soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PS: during the game, we also discussed many other elements of the game, such as the player's equipment, the effect of heavy and light weapons<br/>(or rather "why the hell did I take a heavy weapon rather than a light weapon??"), etc etc. I hope we'll have the occasion to talk about this here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178267/#Comment_178267" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T03:46:16+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2008 3:46AM by Sean ov Newcastle !.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i> 'I should not have given my PC a too specific backstory (with a named villain, a specific quest, etc'</i><br/><br/>I did this in my 1st RBH game (ancestor puts character on quest) and if that character had died it would've seemed unlikely the other characters would have continued along that path.
