This led to me thinking about the entire session being a mahjong game.<br/><br/>So it goes like this. Your characters are all sitting around for a game of mahjong, telling a story that they were all involved with. They might disagree on details and they might remember it differently, but they were all involved. And through the course of playing this game of mahjong that your characters are also playing, you mechanically effect the course of the story. <br/><br/>That's really all I've got so far. And I don't know why mahjong, I just like it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189835/#Comment_189835" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T05:34:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  5:34AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Majiang is really evocative. The main issue, I find, when trying to design games that use it in resolution is that the tiles take up so much of the play space that it's hard to have other implements around, including character sheets and such.  Everything would pretty much have to be represented through the tiles, which is fine, but a restriction in the kinds of designs that are possible.  Additionally, the traditional shuffling and stacking mechanic (setup) can pretty much only be done with four players, so if you want a smaller or larger number, you'd have to have alternate ways of setting up the tiles.<br/><br/>I have this recollection that somebody (Shreyas? Daniel?) wrote a one-page game using majiang tiles at some point, but I don't remember the name of the game, what it was about, or how it played.

Put an emphasis on swapping tiles to represent changing details of the story and on the melds to represent more concrete facts, and drop a lot of the setup and it could easily be modified for more or less people I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189849/#Comment_189849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T12:34:27+00:00" title="January 24, 2009 12:34PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>That was me but I seem to have taken it down from the web.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189865/#Comment_189865" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T18:22:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  6:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mahjong tiles are definitely evocative.
