Sure did like that admirin' touch, guess I liked it a little too much.</a><br/><br/>So I was looking at Jason Morningstar's thread and I had a lot of thoughts on the preference of even his very inconsistent group for a very long campaign.  This is something I've been struggling with with my current group. So let's talk about it!<br/><br/>My normal preference is for a campaign of about 6 months of weekly play.  The reason for this is because around the 4 month mark I get some idea for a brilliant campaign that I have to stop and run OH MAN AS SOON AS I CAN.  (Sometimes this even results in me running two weekly games at the same time. That is exhausting, though.)  The only thing that keeps my interest in the existing game is when I identify an ending, and that heightens the game until I get there.<br/><br/>Of my current group, two people tolerate this and three others really dislike it. They want a game that goes for (this is a quote) years and years. Oh man. I struggle with this.  But it's a challenge! So here's how I'm facing the challenge.<br/><br/>First, I wanted to pick a game situation with a lot of existing material that I could mine.  I angled for the X-Men corner of the Marvel Universe,  because when I was but a boy and a beardless youth, I read shitloads of X-Men stuff. I found the characters really bizarre and compelling (except Wolverine, fuck that guy), even though, to put it lightly, plot was not the strong point.  There were times when nobody, nobody could figure out what the hell was happening or why.  But there was always someone whose identity was causing them problems.  There's only one other guy in the group who reads comics, and he hates all comics (he reads 10 comics a month), so he won't care if I tear it apart for ideas .<br/><br/>Second, I wanted to pick a game that could support virtually infinite variability within characters and character change.  D&amp;D's level-an-loot schema is really, REALLY good for long term games for just this reason.  Pick the length of D&amp;D campaign you want to run, pick the level you want them to end at, divide by the amount of XP you need, blah blah, you've got a perfect pacing tool, absolutely perfect.  I picked Smallville for this reason because you can always shift around your Values, change your Relationship and Value statements, and also you can advance things if you get beat up enough. Sweet.<br/><br/>Third, I need to identify the boundaries of the campaign - things that are just not going to change.  In a long-term Call of Cthulhu campaign, nobody is ever going to storm the Dreamlands and blow up the Elder Gods.  Nobody is ever going to make D&amp;D into an industrial age drama.  And in my X-Men game, nobody is going to make humanity stop hating mutants.<br/><br/>Fourth, I need to identify the Big Pressures of the campaign.  These are things that might change over the lifetime of the many many months we'll be playing, but that won't be solved in a single confrontation.  Dresden Files City Creation has a lot of this in it.  In my X-Men game, the Brotherhood of Mutants, Magneto's terrorist organization, is not going to be defeated in a single confrontation, even if they knock Magneto into the sun or convince him to change his ways.  Someone is going to pick it back up and get with blowing up the government again.  BUT, I want these pressures to change and refine based on what the players do.  I like the term "fronts" (I like books about WWI, OKAY?!), but don't mistake this for what Apocalypse World means by fronts, because I don't really know about that game.  It just fits what I think of in terms of the ongoing battlefield of conflict for the characters.<br/><br/>Okay, more soon. In this thread, post your methods for setting up and adapting to a Long Campaign.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338665/#Comment_338665" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T20:56:50+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  8:56PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This should be interesting!<br/><br/>JD,<br/><br/>Do you have a specific timeline in mind here?

In Smallville, there's no real "target", in other words, a really powerful character doesn't have stats that are super-different from a new character.  They're much more evolutionary.  The pacing issue isn't mediated by the Smallville system.  I'm going to have to have some other way of pacing things.<br/><br/>If you don't know how long your game's going to be, you might try to set up some kind of cycle.  i.e. in a D&amp;D game, say "okay gang, we're going to retire characters to demigoodhood sometime after 20th level. So when these characters reach 10th level, we will make new characters and integrate them into the game world, to be our 'second generation'." <br/><br/>I have some ideas for what to do in my current Smallville game, though typing this out has made me think of a way to do a cycle in this game too!

I think this is a bit of a separate topic.  <br/><br/>First of all, YES, if you want to play another game, with this group, in the place of the long-running campaign, you should be looked at as if you are advocating taking something away from the group, because you are. You are saying "let's stop doing this and do something else".  If people don't want to, that's their right, just as it's your right to say "let's stop".  It's pretty rare in a super-long campaign that anyone (other than the game organizer) has a veto on what the rest of the group is going to do.  (The game organizer has the same veto in one-shots, by the way.  "Get out of my house, it's late.")<br/><br/>But if what you're saying is "I want to leave this game, I don't want to play it anymore even if the rest of you do", there has to be some attention paid, preferably up front, to what will happen if someone decides they want to leave. It's certainly not the responsibility of the person leaving to make that transition easy/satisfying - they're <i>stopping</i>, that's the whole point.  So it has to be plans/expectations of the remaining group that are put into play.  Yet the same is true for any game lasting longer than a session.  If someone decides they don't want to show, that can disrupt certain games.  The group should be planning ahead to think about this.  Exit strategies are important to any enterprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338674/#Comment_338674" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T22:07:56+00:00" title="August 13, 2011 10:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure...<br/><br/>But what's your groups approach to the "Long Campaign"?

This seems to me to be one of the least interesting ways to have someone leave the game, and is not likely to be what I choose if it happens, but this person apparently had had friendships blow up over this and wanted everyone to be aware that this might happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338865/#Comment_338865" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T10:16:04+00:00" title="August 15, 2011 10:16AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, but what about YOU?

Maybe constraints are... well, constraining your notion of how to run a years-and-years campaign?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>some attention paid, preferably up front, to what will happen if someone decides they want to leave</blockquote>"This Month's EPIC Issue: The Death of Jean Gray!"<br/><br/>Is this really a problem? Yes, even if the organizer (GM, primary creative consultant) is the one to go? (Assuming another can be found, and not that it also means The Death Of ___ so that ___'s player can take over as GM--in fact, I've seen players-become-GMs engender "GM PCs" a LOT, in LARP!)<br/><br/>Doh... reading on, I see you think The Death Of is weak sauce. OK, fine--plenty of codas out there that don't mean death. Consider it a shorthand for "the exit of this character as an actively-run entity in the campaign, relegated to NPC status at best, mysterious absentee or death at worst."<br/><br/>You mention "someone doesn't show up after a session," too--sounds like Jason's thread and yours are about the same, from different tacks. Your concern is the method to sustain long campaign; his is that, even with the people to sustain it, they can't get consistency. I BET that many of the same solutions apply to both issues. Ensemble play, mission-based plots, single-session coherence without cliffhangers, GM rotation, and so forth. Should be fun to see what else emerges as the tree is chopped down at both the canopy and the roots. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338929/#Comment_338929" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T14:16:35+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  2:16PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I had a D&amp;D campaign run for 20 years with the same characters so I am trying to think if I have any suggestions for longevity beyond, "Have players extremely attached to their characters and skilled at egging you on to keep GMing."<br/><br/>I understand that urge to want to change pace and style for a time and I think finding a way to work other genre's into your game is a useful safety valve.  With the 2nd ed D&amp;D, Ravenloft gave me the excuse to have the Mists snatch them at any time for a little Gothic fun, Spelljammer allowed for D&amp;D In Space!, and once you've got the ability to plane hop, a GM can pretty much make up just about anything and have his players wander through it for awhile.  Now not every world and cosmology allows for easy genre jumping, but just as you have identified what boundaries you won't cross, it is worth looking at how far you can stretch your game's boundaries so that when that urge for a new game comes, you can fold some of that urge back into the Long Term Campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338940/#Comment_338940" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T15:05:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  3:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow 20 year D&amp;D; campaign with the same characters and all the same players?

The X-Men universe includes several settings, such as "Dinosaur riding in the Savage Lands!", "Space Pirate Steals Your Girlfriend!", "Overly-powerful Mutant threatens everything!"

Are your "OHH SHINY" campaign inspirations mutable in this way- and would they scratch the itch?

So maybe it's easier to stick to timeline evolutions with the same cast (thinking NPCs) and location.  The band becomes huge- but they're Mutants!  Political climate changes, following this or that big season finale.  Though the whole school could still go on a field trip/band tour of the Shi'ar empire.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it work for you?

I started in 7th grade with a group of five players and we played roughly weekly until we graduated high school.  We lost two players over the course of high school and picked up another and then that core group of four remained steady.  Through college we played once a holiday and then near weekly through the summers.  Then one of our players moved for grad school and the next ten years were monster sessions once or twice a year when we all were back in our hometown.  We would still be playing at that rate now but I moved away and don't get back to the hometown much anymore.<br/><br/>As for the leveling up, I want to say that they started at first in seventh grade and were somewhere in the high teens/low twenties when we headed for college.  They are currently in the high twenties level wise.  We started at 1st ed, converted to 2nd ed when it came out and stayed there since none of us were interested in learning a new rule set to play the game we'd been playing for a decade.  <br/><br/>As for the apprentices/retainers, yes we did do that but not as the main group.  If only two members were available on a weekend or a few of us were hanging out and suddenly got an urge to game, they would break out their lower level followers and play as them for a while.  A few of those hirelings actually became powerful enough to join the main group with either the players running two characters or me NPC'ing them.  Sure, they died more often but they were still useful.<br/><br/>Our gaming sessions were pretty much solid adventure.  They did build a pair of temples, a castle and a city to go around them and I did work that city and its needs into their adventures, but my group wasn't much for "a day in the life" playing or high level politics.  They wanted to kick open doors, slay demons and take their stuff.  I did run a scenario where they had to gather an army to protect their town from an oncoming horde and they played out going to all the leaders and creatures that they helped over the years asking for help and calling in debts.  That was really fun because they dug into their histories and each player remembered different highlights and places to look for aid.  Reincorporation is definitely key in a Long Term Campaign.    <br/><br/>Scaling power levels became tricky over time if you want to keep a shred of believability to the world because you have to ask yourself just how many 25th level necromancers does this world have and how is it no one noticed them until now?  Plane hopping became quite common at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339126/#Comment_339126" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T20:25:26+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  8:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so one more question-answering post and then back to my plans/thoughts.  It does feel really weird to be talking on this thread when I'm just <i>trying</i> this, it may not be successful for me at all.  Let's find out together!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>BUT... if you really want "years and years"... maybe constraints HAVE to be broken-through...? There's always another turtle below that one.<br/><br/>Sorry... carry on if I seem disruptive... that stuff just grabbed me as possibly salient. Maybe constraints are... well, constraining your notion of how to run a years-and-years campaign?</blockquote>\nNo, no, you're not wrong.  See how my second step connects to the first step.  The constraints are important because otherwise you can just do aaaaaaaaaaaaanything, and you might as well just go shoot yourself rather than try to get an initial situation out of the entirety of the breadth of fictional possibility.  Plus, even in a super-long-term game, there has to be some coherence, some way for people to say "yes, this is right!" or "no, this is wrong" at the end as much as at the beginning.  <br/><br/>But sometimes there are going to be Big Situation Elements (normally setting, but not always) that are really long term, but let you completely change your milieu once they are altered.  (And of course, once you've gotten used to that, you can change them back.  "We hate mutants after all!")  Those are identified in my second step. So really you're asking "hey, aren't there some things in your first step that might be in your second step?" The answer is yes, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>The X-Men universe includes several settings, such as "Dinosaur riding in the Savage Lands!", "Space Pirate Steals Your Girlfriend!", "Overly-powerful Mutant threatens everything!" (repeat), "MUtopia", "Hated and Feared and on the run", "Media stars (feeding the hate)", "Future Dystopia" and so on and on.</blockquote>\nYes, exactly.  You want to have a sufficiently rich milieu that you can identify a LOT of very broad situations in it that will take considerable effort to deal with.  This is one reason the Forgotten Realms is also so great.  There are literally thousands of supervillains trying to constantly blow it up from every possible direction, and all of them have massive country-spanning conspiracies, dupes and hot chicks and dudes forced into impossible situations.<br/><br/>So when you're planning a Long Term Campaign, don't make a campaign based around the mini-game of the ostrich racing semifinals in Lower Slobovia in 1855.  Doesn't mean you can't start there, or with ostrich racers, or Lower Slobovian gangsters trying to fix the race, or that you can't go there at some point.  One of my later posts is going to be about focusing down, which is HIGHLY important to do not just at the beginning, but throughout the campaign, so having a "chapter" about an event of that specificity will help.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>What I'm thinking is keeping the same universe and characters (if they want), but allowing the in-game setting to evolve over real-world time (say, oh, every 4-6 months) as you explore the questions of the premise in a completely different genre?

My own GMing itch is normally about mechanics and their interaction with the situation, so it will be interesting to see if that kind of change-up might help me fix my own jackdawness.  But yes, exactly this kind of thing helps.  Nevertheless I think you want to have a sort of "home base" as well, something where players can look and remind themselves that they are still playing in the same campaign.  D&amp;^D does this with loot, Smallville does it with Relationships.  No matter what happens in the Savage Land, they're still going to have to cope with their parents.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>It just struck me that Smallville doesn't seem very conducive to upping sticks and the implied shifting around of Relationships and Resources without some re-engineering.</blockquote>\nActually...it does.  It does in a way that I haven't ever seen before (and which in some cases is actively resisted.)  In Smallville, you are <i>rewarded</i> for challenging your Relationships and Values - you get to triple them, then have a scene about how they've changed.  So if you need triple dice to do something, maybe it's time to do it for the girl you've claimed you hated since day one, but now you're SECRETLY IN LOVE with her and you HAVE TO RESCUE her from the purple death robots.<br/><br/>This is one reason I picked the system, because while power level isn't too crazy, it allows for characters to undergo the constant shifting of points of view and motivations that will always propel them forward.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>(As an aside, I am impressed with your Uncanny campaign website and multimedia.  looks like you produce a lot of supporting material for your campaigns- does this come out of your initial burst of enthusiasm for the campaign idea?

But in many ways, Smallville characters seem like they <i>are</i> setting.

What I'm getting at is after the season breaks, if things come back 'different' all of a sudden.  That 'Hall of Residence 2d8 (party, study)' resource is much less useful on Asteroid M or the Savage Lands, and access to the supporting cast and foils likewise possibly restricted.  These elements came out during Pathways, modified by the way you can challenge and evolve those elements in play.  Smallville doesn't have the step-change mechanic, where you can pick up Ka-Zaar instead of the Physics Tutor.  Or maybe it does, been a while since I read the rules.  If you're just winding time forward, the cast and resources can remain largely the same.  Not a showstopper, and easily worked around (Rename This Inappropriate Thing to That for now).  Or maybe each step-change season starts with a custom Pathways step that encapsulates How I Got Here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339155/#Comment_339155" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T23:43:21+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:43PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think what you're supposed to do for Relationships/Assets that arise after Pathways is:<br/><br/>* Spend a Plot Point to use them temporarily if all you're doing is using them temporarily.<br/>* Then have a tag scene about them and make them permanent if you're going to have them for a while.<br/><br/>Because there is no reason to save Plot Points, you're never shut out of the Relationship/Asset economy even if you're leading a Genoshan Resistance halfway across the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339160/#Comment_339160" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T00:18:40+00:00" title="August 17, 2011 12:18AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanics for gaining new Assets/Relationships, sure.

So theoretically, anyway, a player who finds his character on Asteroid M for the forseeable future (where the relationships with his girlfriend, landlord, or favorite snitch back in California are no longer so useful) could just lay into tag scenes at every opportunity showing how he develops all these new relationships with the shuttle commander, android butler, or the Scarlet Witch...knowing that not having enough in his growth pool to get those increases for "free" will just mean that he'll be trading an old relationship for a new one on a one-to-one basis.<br/><br/>It would be a fairly minor hack to extend that "win it in the tag scene or step an existing one back to pay for it" mechanic to locations and extras...assuming that's not already covered by the rules, which I think it might be.  Plus, all those tag scenes would mean that players get to put their new relationships/extras/locations directly in the spotlight right away, which is pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339175/#Comment_339175" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T02:24:45+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  2:24AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Plus, all those tag scenes would mean that players get to put their new relationships/extras/locations directly in the spotlight right away, which is pretty cool.</blockquote>\nWhen you're right, you're right.

In other words, my normal starting point for a campaign like this is "You're the new X-Men and you're on your first mission together!" But because so much of Smallville is about relationships, they wanted to have more of a ramp up to that.  So as a result the first 8 sessions or so were them running around college messing up their classes, finding out each other are mutants and that Emma Frost is training a new X-Men team, and then the Brotherhood of Mutants attacks and oh man, the team is THEM. Pretty great stuff, but I have to admit that there were times where I was, internally, yelling "AHH SHIT, JUST GO ZOOMING IN WEARING UNSTABLE MOLECULES AND BLOW THINGS UP", but the game wasn't there yet.  They absolutely did NOT want <i>in media res</i>, and as a result, the rising action rose more and further.<br/><br/>Still, this creates a high degree of reality with respect to the NPCs and world that will definitely help once things go over the edge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349221/#Comment_349221" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-19T11:09:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2011 11:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coolness, thanks for the update.

I kill the characters with increasingly epic challenges, and they thus never achieve too high a level. The players start anew with new characters. Campaign cohesion is maintained by interests not related to individual characters, and by use of character stables. Players can avoid the ever-present threat of character death by retiring their characters voluntarily. Because the interest in continuing character survival increases with initial survival, sooner or later player interest in his character's survival overcomes his greed for further adventures, causing character retirement. There's no need to pace character development, players go as fast as they can, before death catches up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357904/#Comment_357904" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T14:26:25+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  2:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good thinking there...I think I might have some difficulty with that with this group, especially my wife, who hates character creation and does not want to do it.  <br/><br/>Let's try a thought experiment, a D&amp;D game starting at level 1.

For example, as Sam mentions above, seriously injured heroes get to sit out for one or more sessions, easy. Same for guys who have to look after their estates or engage in long-term training or research. It's also notable that you wouldn't take a belowed character to a desperate or suicidal adventure, you'd rather take one you are willing to lose (this is a psychological overture to outright retirement, I'd say). And of course there are the cases where "my guy wouldn't go on this adventure" - no problem, just make a guy who would!<br/><br/>(That last one never grows old when it's the player's first character. Sometimes the player really does roll up a different character who apparently does have adventuring motivation where the first one didn't.)<br/><br/>I execute a Gygax-style calendar myself, so time flows in real time in the fantasy campaign. A character who takes it to the chin takes 1d6 weeks to recuperate, while one at the gates of death will take 1d6 months. This, combined with real time, gives us a rough estimate of how long a given character's asylum stay might be. As might be imagined, a character stable tends to develop quite naturally in these conditions simply because your main man is not always available. (It's notable that I've made characters pretty "sticky" in comparison to canonical D&amp;D, so most of the time you're out of a fight before you're dead.)<br/><br/>If GM coordination is required, it might not be a bad idea to institute an outright rule where everybody needs to have characters ready to go equal to the level of the highest-level character in their stable. Then maybe some rules about when you're allowed to play your "main guy", if the above sorts of pressures aren't desired in assuaging players. For example, you could intentionally play a mix of high-level and low-level adventures, and forbid a character of level &gt;N from participating in a level N adventure; this would quite naturally force players to play secondary characters from time to time after their main characters are of higher level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357976/#Comment_357976" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T06:07:57+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  6:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an interesting personal discovery this thread brought out, I really internally rebel at the idea of a stable of characters. Or at least I do in a D&amp;D type setting. No matter how much meta-sense it makes, something inside me doesn't love this concept.<br/><br/>Except...<br/><br/>Except I've been talking with Jason about the exciting opportunity of building a sprawling superhero universe with the new Marvel RPG. The big key to this is, of course, a growing stable of characters. Maybe this is because I foresee, at least to start, the groups of characters being connected to one another so that Group A is played together but not with Group B.<br/><br/>But even that doesn't entirely jive because I foresee crossovers between the two (or three or a hundred) groups happening frequently <i>eventually</i>.<br/><br/>So is this just an in-fiction issue I have with the stable of characters idea? I'm not sure...<br/><br/>This may or may not be at all helpful to the conversation unless there are others who have my same or similar reaction.

It might be shorter or longer in application due to any number of reasons. For example, sometimes we're running such an intensive dungeon that players request a "time-stop" in between sessions, so that play can continue in the midst of the expedition the next time we play. Technically this sort of thing could be construed as stopping the calendar (although I've usually just assumed that the first session happened a bit later or the last session a bit earlier than nominal - haven't had to really worry about it yet, as there haven't been really time-critical events in multiple theaters of operations going on simultaneously so far). Similarly there can be in-session downtime that accelerates the passage of time.<br/><br/>In practice, though, we don't keep a "hard" rule on these things, recovery times and other downtime things are more of a suggestion and inspiration for how we frame the next adventure. If a player really really has to get to play this particular character right now, we'll usually work out an early release for him - I usually fuck with the character a bit, asking for gold or recovery checks or whatever, but in reality we're just negotiating an acceptable fictional positioning where everybody is willing to have a buy-in for adventure. (I suppose a childish enough player could really twist my arm in fictional positioning, as long as we wanted to play with him.) It's also possible to make an adventure out of the recovery - the player brings in his character's dear brother who insists that everybody together should help him carry his injured kin to this fountain of youth deep in the jungle or whatever. If the players want to insist on it and are willing to prove their mettle, there's no reason to not get out of the penalty box earlier than the doctor's prognosis indicates.<br/><br/>Aaand this is clearly off-topic here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358001/#Comment_358001" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T09:15:04+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  9:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see a connection.
