(^.^)<br/><br/>However, I have a feeling that he meant (as he says elsewhere) that the blank character sheet is when the FUN begins.  Not once your character is all ready to play.

You get a lot of silent, individual thought about what each one of them wants to make, and then either they make a character more or less on their own anyway (maybe telling other people about their own concept, but not really involving themselves in the creation of anyone else's character), or the process gets dragged out until we run out of time, then they go home and think about it over the week and come back next time with a fully-formed character, once again bypassing the whole "group creation" idea.<br/><br/>Eventually you just have to say "fuck it," and let it happen: this is the way they like to make a character, and no angry glare, sneaky trick, or feeble whining is going to change them.  You stop bitching about how no one likes to do things the way you want them to, and just push for changes they <i>can</i> make.<br/><br/>Most of our "independent design" players will gladly heed an admonition to "leave this part of your character blank, we'll determine it later," or "before we play, everyone has to sit down together and work out how their characters know each other and why they all hang out together," or "This part of your character doesn't really work for me, please rework it more along these lines," or even assign each of them to come up with some background detail for someone else's character.  They'll accept and even ENJOY collaboration in bite-sized, strictly-defined portions, because they still get to have most of the pleasure of making their own character at their own pace and in their own way without feeling like you're trying to shit on their fun or put them on the spot.  It works okay, overall -- you get as much overlap and collaboration as you're willing to demand, so long as you give them the room to do their own thing up front.  I'm not convinced that a fully-collaborative group would get noticeably better results, honestly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87591/#Comment_87591" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T01:26:57+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  1:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2007 1:28AM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've taken away from the otherwise pretty traditionally minded podcast "Fear the Boot" is the idea of a group template. Especially for a mechanics-heavy system like d20, GURPS, Hero, whatever - it is just not feasible to have everyone sit down and make characters during a session, especially not with a limited number of sets of books. However, what you <i>can</i> do is sit down without books, and come up with a group template - maybe "a band of outlaw hunters and druids, shunned by society, except for this one nobleman who uses the band for his own benefit". Or "sorcerers all connected by a mysterious pact made by their long dead mentors". Or "a group of rag-tag superheroes that fight each other as much as the villains". Once you have a group template, it gives the GM fuel to consider a campaign (or the framing of the opening scene, or the recurring opponents, or whatever). More importantly, it lets players pick roles that fulfill the group template rather than making their own individual beasts and then trying to fuse them all together into some stunted, misshapen group template where the GM then have to guess at what the players may want to spend their time doing.<br/><br/>I have actually yet to have an opportunity to try this approach, but the idea seems sound.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87626/#Comment_87626" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T08:59:31+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  8:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2007 9:09AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's very sound.  Our group actually tends to put that kind of "group template" right in the initial pitch for a game.  "It's a Star Wars game, you're all fleeing the wreckage of Alderaan and looking to join the Rebel Alliance."  "Let's play Vampire, in San Francisco, the PCs are all high-generation wannabes in the Camarilla."<br/><br/>The fun thing is that everyone in our group bought into this so immediately and so completely that I think it's actually impossible to pitch a game at all now without packaging it with a group template.  If you walk in and say "Hey, let's play Spycraft" and try to leave it at that, you'll get bombarded with questions like "What kinds of characters should we be making?  What sort of stuff are we going to do in this game?  Are we all part of the same agency?", because no one -- not even our most independent-minded character creators -- would even <i>dream</i> of just going off by themselves and making a PC that clashed with whatever the premise of the game is or was diametrically opposed to everyone else's PCs.  They all want to know what's going to fit in the game, and they all scrupulously keep within those boundaries...even if they have basically zero interest in collaborative character creation as far as "everyone sits around the table and helps build everyone else's PC" goes.<br/><br/>In fact, I know this is true, because when someone said that he wanted to run a silly hack-and-slash D&amp;D dungeoncrawl, everyone <i>still</i> hassled him for details about what sort of group template they should try and fit, and refused to take "it doesn't matter, it's just a dungeoncrawl" for an answer.<br/><br/>(You know, it didn't even occur to me until now that people might have been talking about players who go off, write up a character with literally <i>no</i> input from the GM/other players, and then show up with a finished character sheet that doesn't fit with any other PC or with the game's premise.  That would be a huge problem, although I suspect that group templates combined with judicious use of "No, that character really doesn't fit in, let's make some changes" is still the best way to handle it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87681/#Comment_87681" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T17:36:44+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  5:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may seem far out to you, but I've actually been given the opinion from a GM I know, trust and <i>love</i> (my wife) that group templates are a, hm, how did she put it, "waste of time". To her, characters just need to be "real" and react as "in-character consequences" would have them react - she figures the gameplay that emerges is natural and good regardless of how it turns out. For example, if the cat and the dog are brought together under extraordinary circumstances and immediately decides to kill each other instead of fight off Master Rat, then the emergent story is one of failure due to prejudice.<br/><br/>As a player, she'd balk at a premise that included a group template - "WTH are you doing telling me what I can and cannot play" would be a good approximation of her response, I think. She'd then proceed to make an undercover Imperial spy or a deformed Caitiff anarch.<br/><br/>I don't agree with her on this - as in, at all - but such opinions are out there, believe it or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
