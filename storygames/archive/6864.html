I like hearing about names of games that are more "story games" and those that aren't but more so, I like understanding how to bring the "story game style" into any game I want to run/play in, because apparently that's what I naturally gravitate toward.<br/><br/>So when I read this little bit from another thread topic I was intrigued to ask for more from other points of view.<br/><b>Take a gander then please give your ideas as to WHAT "Story Game Style" is and HOW to bring it into any role-playing game.</b><br/>\n<blockquote><b>Andy wrote:</b><br/><i>"an RPG which focuses on 'our story' over 'my character', and while I feel that may be closest, it really - heh - doesn't seperate them from RPGs.

Like, with no work at all, really, just need to look at it from a new angle.<br/><br/>If anything, I'd call it a way of looking at playing your game rather than a "class" of game, a very simple twist in the way you address the game as a whole, that takes no coercion of trad players or even hippie-mechanics.</i></blockquote>\n<br/>It interested me, particularly when Andy noted <i>"put a little elbow grease into anything from L5R (which I'm doing now, S-G Style-e)"</i>...  It had me wondering how he ran L5R differently than I have.

Don't make characters in isolation.  I will sometimes bring in (or try to) some easily portable systems, like Burning Wheel's Beliefs or Spirit of the Century's Aspects, but without resorting to mechanical chicanery, here's how I story game.<br/><br/>I give a rough pitch of the setting/theme of the game I'm thinking of and/or we discuss what we'll play.  I say and/or because it really depends on passion levels.  If I'm gung-ho about a game about werewolves in World War II, then I'll push for that, although there's still flexibility that might range from "realistic" to "cartoonish" style or European of Pacific theater, etc.  Or it might be real vague like "A fantasy setting for D&amp;D. Let's brainstorm!"  And of course in any case if the reaction is "That doesn't sound interesting" then its back to the drawing board or group brainstorming.<br/><br/>Players make their characters as above. They'll largely come up with a reason to be together (or not be together if that's what we're going for), and in addition fill in a lot of campaign detail. A dragon killed your father? Ooh, that will come up again. You're brothers? Awesome, there's a place for tension and bonding. You're an exiled prince? Sounds like a great potential arc there. And so on. The most important thing from character creation is to either establish a status quo for characters and desires.  You will want to challenge the status quo and draw on the desire(s). These don't need to be complex. "Win treasure and gain power" is good enough, if it makes everyone happy.<br/><br/>THEN, before we play, I go back and take all these elements and start plugging in NPCs. A few major and minor ones, depending on how big the game needs to be. I don't focus on stats unless I need to, but I do focus on needs/wants/personality.  What does the NPC need? What does the NPC want? What is the NPC willing to do to get it? What is the NPC like on a queit Saturday night. Etc.  The trick is, that this isn't random, or even "Oh, I've always wanted a paladin villain!"  No.  I mean, that can play a part, but the most important element is to have the needs/wants conflict with the PCs needs/wants or their status quo.  Relationship maps help a lot here. And you don't make them all directly opposed.  Conflict is key, not necessarily opposition.  Some NPCs will have similar goals, but different enough that there will be tension.  Others will be completely different, and incompatible.  It's important that there not be any easy compromise (and that may be because of the nature of the goals or personal beliefs). And it's also important that their goals be something that the PCs cannot ignore.  They might readily agree with those goals, but they can't ignore them.<br/><br/>What's important is that you don't map out a plot.  No future timelines of events that must occur.  Instead, what you have is events that will happen based on NPCs getting their way if the PCs don't stop them.  And they usually do.  But knowing the NPC's desires and personality, you know how to respond. When the evil baron is thwarted in corrupting the church, he'll obviously do something else to get what he wants. When the gruff captain fails to force the PC into line, does he get more desparate for the PC to follow the rules? Or does he start to get won over as the PCs methods wins him over? You'll have an idea, and the most important part is that what the PC did will inform that just as much as the NPC's personality.  So, you end up with a fluid character driven plot.  You don't end up having for force players to follow your story, and when they do something unexpected you'll have the tools to go with the flow (of course, sometimes you might need have the session end there so you can figure it out, but not often).  The extra bonus, if you have players who aren't very proactive and would rather "follow the adventure" then this works for them too (although it might be less fun for you). Because the NPCs create your adventure for you. Their goals should be impossible to ignore, so it won't matter, you'll just have to do more heavy lifting (which you'd have to do for that type of player anyway)<br/><br/>And to me, that's the essence of story gaming. And I've used it for D&amp;D, many White Wolf games, Big Eyes, Small Mouth, Dogs in the Vineyard, and pretty much everything I've run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152715/#Comment_152715" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T11:02:07+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite><b>With more ideas perhaps I can add to my GM toolbox, and so can you.</b></blockquote>\nDude, that sentence, right there?  That's the primary number-one reason for why I created this site. You said it, really well! :-)<br/><br/>So let me be specific, with what I did with L5R:<br/><br/>So I had an idea for an L5R campaign. I wanted to pour more fuel on that fire, so I started this thread over here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4881" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4881</a><br/>Now, not to say that one has to start threads or talk about shit, but I had this feeling that I wanted to run L5R soon, I had my own campaign idea, and wanted to share and get ideas. <br/><br/>I ended up starting up that very campaign this March/April, and we're still playing now: The wall falls, and the Crab Lands are under siege. Now, in my campaign idea shifted a bit (from guarding and leading armies of refugees, to exploring how to put things back together again, and hunt down evil on a personal level), but it's pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Here's how games of L5R went, that I've played in long ago (I've not run it for more than one session until recently):<br/>GM: Let's play L5R.  I'm thinking of something, I dunno, political maybe? Make your characters!<br/>PL1: I'm a lion blade-mistress!<br/>PL2: I'm a crab shaman!<br/>PL3: I'm a Scorpion political saboteur/ninja! (this is me, BTW. I love ninjas)<br/><br/>GM: (thinking to himself) fuck... now I've got to put all these dudes together in something more of a "you meet in a bar then go slay baddies" lameass way.<br/><br/>Eric Provost mentioned to me that he would prep something like 8 hours to run a good 4-6 hour session of L5R, which is why he ended up giving it up over time.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I did was basically started with a Situation, then had the players make up Characters to fit in there, rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>So what I did was I told everyone the vague outline of the game: You're in the Crablands, so most of you should be Crab. You'll be protecting the Wall. It will fall, and the Shadowlands will pour in. How you deal with that is up to you.<br/>Then we made characters, throwing out concepts that fit together. And yet, still doing it in a way that we weren't like LASER FOCUSED on a story, but just keeping it in mind.<br/>Matthew: I want to be a swordsman from the Lion lands, sort of on an exchange of sorts, learning the ways of the Crab. Y'know, like the newbie, who shows to the audience what the world was like. (Matthew is more story-focused). (then Matthew came up with a bit of a backstory, which I injected into the setting with some modification).<br/>Travis: I want to be a tormented guy, who thinks that he's gonna be the downfall of the clan. Maybe a samurai?<br/>Quintin: I want to be a badass sorcerer who throws fireballs. (incidentally, and unexpectedly, he is also a badass with the sword due to how Crab shugenja attributes work out). <br/><br/>Then:<br/>* Travis tied his character to Quintin. He basically married into Quintin's family, and so they're related.  Then, just for shits, they tied it up so that Matthew's Lion samurai is on training with their family. So we could just get right into it without character "meetup scenes" etc (though we will probably do flashbacks later).<br/>* Quintin wrote up that he wanted a mentor. So I made that mentor, and the backstory around it, central to the "plot" or whatever I'm developing for the game.<br/><br/>So that was the setup: "Lay out the situation" first, then make the characters.  The next post is about all the other crazy shit I did...<br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152719/#Comment_152719" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T11:21:54+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont)<br/><br/>OK, so in the game, I basically used the character issues given to me to create and drive the "plot". I kept my mind open so that if the players really seemed interested in following some plot point, I would dedicate more to that.<br/><br/>Next, and this is something I've been doing a lot lately, I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">let</span> make the players play the roles of NPCs as well, including major NPCs.  Not ALL NPCs, but most of them. So if there's a scene where only one PC is present, and that PC is talking to his master (a major NPC), I might turn that character over to a player for that scene, or I might play him if there's like one thing he needs to say to "advance the plot" (or if I have some mystery planned).<br/><br/>Basically, I see the suggestion to let players play NPCs a lot, but it always amounts to innkeeps and traders and other non-important background dudes.  A couple games ago in With Great Power I got clued into (by accident) having the players play major NPCs instead of me, and being thrilled with the results: The players take the characters in new, unexpected directions, and it's always worked out for the best.  Some times I would play the first "instance" the NPC appears, and then in future scenes turn them over (so I can set up what they're like). Other times, I just give a quick description and say, "Go nuts". And again, each one of the players is AWESOME at doing this. <br/><br/>Plus, in the course of one game, you still have your own character, but you get to experiment by playing the roles of other characters as well. I dig it.<br/><br/>====<br/><br/>Anyway, the above is what we did to "kick it off". The rest is what I did when I hit a stumbling block:<br/><br/>====<br/>So, we were using the L5R sheets, and I think significantly "story-ing it up", having fun and all. Matthew, though, noticed that he kept forgetting elements about his character that he wanted to bring up in play. They were written on the very bottom of the original L5R sheet in the notes section, under all those lines about weapons and skills and health damage. He was like, "I kinda like those games where you can see what you care about, right there on your sheet". <br/><br/>And I'm like, "shit, that's easy, I'll just make up a new sheet where that stuff is written down, front and center, so they won't forget".  Anyway, in the process of writing these down (using the games The Riddle of Steel and The Shadow of Yesterday as a basis) I started thinking of how I could house-rule them into the game.<br/><br/>Now, you don't need to go as far as I did, but to significantly "SG it up" I ended up basically implementing a bunch of houserules on things like:<br/>* Writing down your goals, desires, etc.<br/>* Tying them to the 5 "circles" (elements) in the game<br/>* House-ruling Honor, because I didn't like how it worked in L5R (I basically made it more Sim-y, more "realistic" IMO, by making it something you can employ, or have turned against you).<br/>* And making them all work out on the sheet.<br/>* Tied them to advancement, because I didn't like the "play for 6 months of real time to gain one level" of the original experience system.<br/>and then, just for shits and giggles, I <br/>* Added Fan-Mail (from Primetime Adventures). Because I love fan-mail.<br/><br/>But everything else, including skill rolls (task resolution!), combat, armor, wounds (with some modification to the death-spiral), attributes, spells, all that stuff works the same as-is. I just added "more" to pimp out the game into what we wanted. But in truth, I could have stopped simply with "Write your goals/feelings/desires on your character sheet, and remember to play them".<br/><br/>My result, including the character sheet, are over here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5878&amp;page=1#Comment_136040" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5878&amp;page=1#Comment_136040</a><br/><br/>So yeah, hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152722/#Comment_152722" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T11:29:47+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, yeah, something like:\n<ul>\n<li>Focussing on relationships between characters</li>\n<li>An egalitarian style, where the GM is seen as equal to the players</li>\n<li>Doing things as a group</li>\n<li>All sharing in narration</li>\n<li>Enjoying nasty things happening to your character</li>\n</ul>\n...would be common, I guess.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152735/#Comment_152735" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T12:42:07+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 12:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>We can be traveling religious enforcers among the halflings!</blockquote>Halfpints in the Brewery                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152736/#Comment_152736" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T12:51:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 12:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2008 1:22PM by M Eryesen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've noticed that's common about a lot of story focused games is that the in game stats often describe what is important for a character rather than the character's competencies.  And what is important for a character doesn't necessarily mean what is important <i>to</i> the character.  It could be what is important to the player, or to the overall theme of the game.<br/><br/>You can tweak the skill system of the game in question in this direction.  Or in many cases, the entire skill sub-system can be removed and replaced.<br/><br/>Say I decided to do this with the new 4th edition of D&amp;D.  Skills in D&amp;D are valued at half the characters level, a bonus based on the governing stat (say, intelligence for knowledge skills) and a flat bonus if the character is trained (and possibly some other bonuses from feats, class, race, etc.,).  A given character will have so many trained skills.  But what if instead of trained skills, you made them "important skills"?  So whenever a player has a character that uses an important skill, they get to narrate the outcome, positive or negative.  And say for example, once per session they have to narrate a flashback pertaining to that skill.<br/><br/>So a player might decide that he really likes the idea of his character being an expert conman and that his character secretly hates himself for it and is as good at lying to himself as he is others.  So he makes "bluff" one of his important skills.  During the game he rolls a bluff roll to have the character convince the local constable he had nothing to do with a warehouse fire at the docks.  The player then decides to narrate a quick flash back.  <br/><br/>He's a boy, maybe 10.  His mother is gripping him tightly by the arms.  Through the window behind him men are pouring buckets of water on the burnt out remains of the town's grain silo.  "Ol' Zech said he saw you and your friends playing near the silo.  Tell me, do you know how the fire started?"  "I don't Mama.  I swear I don't.  We were already heading to the river when we heard the shouts."  "Oh.. thank goodness!" she exclaims, hugging him fiercely with a look of pure relief on her face.

Hashizume Hiroko. She was going to be a sorceress, a minor NPC, possibly a love interest, and possibly a re-occurring character. She's basically 15 koku of sex in a 10-koku barrel.<br/><br/>Quintin's PC showed interest in her, so I came up with a story about how she studied under the same master as Quintin's shugenja. Then (kinda rolling along, not really thinking too deep about what I'm saying, mind you) I say that "The master threw her out of the school".<br/><br/>Travis: "LOL. Like, he literally picked her up, and threw her out?"<br/>Andy: ...<br/>Andy: ...<br/>Andy: ...<br/>Andy: "HOLY SHIT YES!! That's exactly what happened!"<br/><br/>That was such a cool joke/idea that I ran with it. I described the scene how Quintin's normally calm, collected, elusive and entirely dispassionate master flew into a rage about something she did, and instead of dismissing her, he physically labored down, picked her up, and threw her into the courtyard. After which he commanded that they never speak of her again.<br/><br/>All the players leaned forward, soaking it up. They ALL now, especially Quintin, want to get to the bottom of what she did to piss off the master. In that instant I changed that character from a minor NPC to a major setting NPC, with mysterious goals - Now two of the characters are tracking her down because they think she has something to do with the fall of the wall; she does... but in what way? (currently, I have a few nascent ideas and a pretty good explanation which is unfolding into a plotline, but nothing set in stone). She's become one of the more memorable characters, and both I and Travis played her in scenes.<br/><br/>So, that's just a way that staying open, rolling with stuff, not setting your plot in stone, and being willing to go in a new direction on a whim from getting inspiration from a player, can really be awesome. Not sure how "Story-Gamey" that idea is, but I use it a lot, and it works really well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153182/#Comment_153182" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T12:44:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 12:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            She also pulled a Saffron on me.

I'll go inside and try to find someone who looks like a gruff, old war veteran. Is there anyone there?"<br/><br/>Then you say:<br/><br/>"Ok, you're standing in the bar in front of an older... hang on, how did you recognize the veteran? What kind of signs were you looking for?"<br/><br/>And you might get:<br/><br/>"Well, I figured I was looking for someone with some serious scars, maybe a missing arm, or maybe even wearing one of those old jackets with their Platoon insignia on the back."<br/><br/>Now you have a scene and a description of the NPC, and you can just play out what happens!<br/><br/>The player, even if the "immersive" type, sometimes doesn't realize they made it up because they were just drawing on something they had already imagined--something that was already there in their mind. Just like when someone playing a character in a library might say, "I reach for one of the newer books on the top shelf..."<br/><br/>You never described the book or the shelf, but in imagining the scene, they had already created it--in their mind. So when they bring it out into the open, it doesn't necessary feel like narrating something new to the rest of the group as much as "exploring" the environment already existing in their mind.<br/><br/>This is why those techniques, like "say yes or roll the dice", do not actually harm or destroy immersion, as some fear they might, but rather help things along. The GM just has to let go of their treasured vision for a moment--and the result is usually that the game flows along more smoothly.<br/><br/>[Edited to clarify.]<br/><br/>(If anyone has had the opposite experience, however, I'd love to hear about it!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
