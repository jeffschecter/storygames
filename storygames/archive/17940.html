Our starting resources were: ammunition, (safe) air, affection and wood.  We chose ammunition to be the abundance.<br/><br/>Through play, we lost the ammunition and gained fuel as an abundance.  We cured the air scarcity, traded affection for freedom on the scarcity list, found wood and added several more scarcities, many of which were also addressed: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">food</span>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">people</span>, health &amp; fertility, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">food</span>.<br/><br/>I contributed <i>affection</i> as one of the initial resources.  It seemed like a grim and potent thing to be considering, either way it went.  I hope that it colored the game that way, but the most immediate effects it had on our play were darkly comedic; a system of enforced dating at gun-point, etc.   <br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing what other sets of resources people have used.  How did your resources morph across game-play?  Were there any less tangible resources that worked well or didn't?<br/><br/>Also, if you have any other interesting observations about the relationship between resources and the way the game plays out, that would be neat.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
