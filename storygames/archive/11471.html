I also think that would be dreadfully dull (though perhaps not entirely without merit). I mean, just treating the game as resigning yourself to fate...okay, I see how it models that, but don't see where the 'story game' is in all that.<br/><br/>What I thought you meant on Twitter was "what can you use C&amp;L to model," and to me it could model the trials and tribulations of entrepreneurs and the full experience that is Capitalism. The ladders are places where an unexpected windfall rockets you closer to your goal, and the chutes are unexpected problems and setbacks.<br/><br/>Except, they really aren't unexpected, are they? We all know that there are chutes and ladders on the road ahead, we're just hoping we can hit enough ladders to reach our goal...before the other people do. We can plan for it, in the sense that we try many things to hopes that one will pay off. So, it's competition, the (ideal) heart of capitalism. Who are these players representing and what are they competing over? Business rivals vying to be the first to bring some product to market? Personal rivals trying to be the first to be a millionaire before his or her college buddies?<br/><br/>Anyway, just some initial thoughts.<br/><br/>- Ryan<br/><br/>(Oh, right, replace "chutes" with "snakes" and it's all good, baby.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255592/#Comment_255592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T17:17:35+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  5:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_games_list" rel="nofollow">um...no.</a></blockquote>\nI dunno.

That's kinda hippie drug-addled cult land, or "Fatalism" (which seems to be more a Christian-born thought, or at least inspired by Greeks).<br/><br/>In classical Buddhism of any tradition (except Zen, there's a lot of rock-star weirdness in there), the game of Chutes and Ladders might be "be mindful of how you feel when you play the game"; "watch as people curse the dice or feel joy through them; why is that?"<br/><br/>Or better yet, the chutes and ladders board is 100 x 100 feet, your piece weighs 80 pounds, the dice weigh 50 pounds each, and you only get a bowl of rice with pickles once before you play and once after, regardless of who wins.<br/><br/>Or maybe make a giant chutes and ladders board out of sand, then wipe it away before its played. :-)<br/><br/>So in the end, I don't think it's Buddhist.

Who hasn't cheered over a critical hit on a d20, or a botched roll that we had a lot (in our minds) riding on? That feeling of luck, fate and exhilaration is one of the reasons I think that even the hippie small-press folks are so in love with using a randomization mechanic, with dice at the square center of that randomization: That rush, triumph and defeat is really exciting as a player.<br/><br/>Here's a story: As a side-adventure to our Long AD&amp;D 2E Campaign in high school, the DM did a 3-session adventure set in another area of his campaign, a Mythic Scotland kind of realm. I remember very little, that I was a fighter with a two-handed sword, and that I ran naked in the snow to an altar where I killed some witches or something.<br/><br/>But I do remember one thing VERY clearly about that campaign, and it's the most vivid memory of those entire 3 sessions:<br/><br/>When I rolled my fighter character, I had an 18 strength (we used a die assignment method from one of the AD&amp;D supplements which pretty much assured you of one "18" if you wanted it) and I had to roll percentile dice to determine what my "percentile strength" was.<br/><br/>I rolled a 97. I rolled it, my best friend was watching. I hollared and started writing down this great score on my sheet.<br/><br/>But the DM didn't see it. He didn't watch me roll it. He called BS, saying "Look, I trust you and all, but for this and hit points I need to *see* the roll. That's the way we play." And to my credit (I was 16 at the time) I thoughtfully nodded my head, agreeing "thems are the rules". 'Sides, it was only a mini-campaign, so I didn't really care too strongly. So I rolled again, in front of the DM.<br/><br/>I rolled a 00. One hundred. The single highest score, which has its own special damage and attack bonus categories. We all cheered, even the DM. <br/><br/>Again, I remember little about that campaign, but man I still remember making that die roll.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255613/#Comment_255613" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T18:45:54+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  6:45PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>It's useful, I think, to look back at the classic games and analyse the themes at the heart of them.<br/><br/>Snakes and Ladders, for example, is clearly a Buddhist game.

Snakes and Ladders is Alea, sure, but I think there's the self deception of agon happening as well: That you are competing with the others, even though underneath it all the game is solely ruled by alea-style pure chance.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Sure, but you're "competing" in a lottery, too. Caillois's distinction is that in agon, the outcome is determined by the skill of the participants, while in alea the outcome is the product of chance: you're subjecting yourself to a turn of the Wheel of Fortune. I suppose you're right that some people might kid themselves that their victory or defeat in the game is a reflection of their own virtues. Children are particularly susceptible to this error in thinking.<br/><br/>Of course, Caillois does admit the possibility of mixed types: there are many games in which skill combines with luck to determine the outcome, such as poker and backgammon. He implies that they are structured something like this:<br/><br/><code>   Agon &lt;-------&gt; Alea<br/>     |    \\   /     |<br/>     |     \\ /      |<br/>     |      X       |<br/>     |     / \\      |<br/>     |    /   \\     |<br/>Mimicry &lt;-------&gt; Ilinx</code><br/><br/>where agon is fundamentally contrary to ilinx because agon is all about control (using the resources at hand to secure victory in a contest) and ilinx is all about dislocation (spin in a circle and you get dizzy! Wheee!). Similarly, alea is fundamentally contrary to mimicry because alea is uses the element of play to inform "real-world" consequences (roll the dice! what do they say?) while mimicry uses elements of the real world to inform the "magic circle" of play (I'm the cop! You're the robber! That means I'm supposed to catch you and you go to jail!)<br/><br/>Caillois also distinguishes between <i>paidaia</i> and <i>ludus</i> as modes of play, where the paidaic is "playful" in the purest sense, and the ludic is rule-bound, centered on the game as game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256116/#Comment_256116" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T07:13:28+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  7:13AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2010 7:14AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly concerned about what Buddhists can do with roleplaying games.

Snakes &amp; Ladders... on a typical roll, we are at risk of sliding down a full row and/or at risk of climbing a full row. Or multiple rows. That's big stakes. That's like a 10% setback or a 10% bonus, on the table on almost every single roll.<br/><br/>It makes sense that those big, game-impacting possibilities would be exciting to us... we talk to our dice, pray for a good roll, etc, etc... and that's where the fun comes in. In the gamble.<br/><br/>It'd be like if D&amp;D had Fumbles on 1-3, and Critical Hits on 16-20. The simple act of rolling to hit would be (artificially) way more exiting, because it's really likely that it'll change the course of the battle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256166/#Comment_256166" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T11:40:55+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 11:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>After all that, of course, I've got little to say.<br/><br/>I find Snakes and Ladders fascinating.

If you regard the game as a metaphor for the operation of karma in reincarnation, with ascending a ladder representing reincarnation in a higher state and sliding down the snake's throat (or chute) that in a lower one, it teaches that our fortunes in life are a product of forces outside our control rather than our own virtues, which is a good thing to come to grips with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256168/#Comment_256168" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T11:50:33+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 11:50AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." \u2013 Ecclesiastes 9:11                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256181/#Comment_256181" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T13:01:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  1:01PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2010 7:38AM by Alex F.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's more than slot machines.<br/>It's snail racing.<br/><br/>Ever done snail racing? I had a flutter at a village fete. It's great. Unless you closely follow snail form (which is not the typical stance of a snail race flutterer) you have no idea which one will win. So, it's a toss-up.<br/><br/>But it's also continually promising something. An upset. The one who is ahead at any point? Should be the odds-on winner. If they're far enough ahead, should be a cert. And yet, at any point, things can go pear-shaped, and the underdog can become the leader. And then, the laggard again.<br/><br/>Those upsets are extremely pleasing. <i>'Markus was so sure he was going to win - now see him at square 11 again! snort!'</i> They're akin to status drops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256187/#Comment_256187" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T13:18:29+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  1:18PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=psychology+of+gambling&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=40000001&amp;as_sdtp=on" rel="nofollow">Yes, it's a psychological thing.</a> Gambling and games of chance <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200603/gambling-the-pipe-dream-payoff" rel="nofollow">pervert evolutionary incentives to trick our minds and emotions.</a> And, from Ecclesiastes and the teachings of the Buddha to modern self-help books, people have long recognized that peace of mind is greatly aided by not falling into that trap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256191/#Comment_256191" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T13:57:43+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  1:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Snakes and Ladders - just say no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256265/#Comment_256265" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T03:23:47+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  3:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Truely random might be anathema to RPGs where players expect their decisions to influence probabilities to a greater extent, but truly random is also the only genuinely level playing field, where everyone has precisely the same chances of success regardless of personal intelligence, tactical thinking, or a carefully designed character.
