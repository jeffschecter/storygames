Don't try to play Vampire with GURPS, and don't try to play GURPS with D&amp;D.  The rules of the game support some kinds of play, and make other kinds of play more difficult.  Don't fight it.  Make sure everyone is on board for the kind of play the game supports, and work together to make that happen.<br/><br/><b>Story Comes From Characters</b><br/><br/>There's a common assumption in many RPGs that the GM creates the story, and the players interact with it through their characters.  This is frequently disfunctional in play.  A story is nothing more than the actions of characters - for a GM to create a story without controlling the characters is impossible.  For the players to control their characters without changing the story is also impossible.  A lot of tension in many games derives from this point.  The answer is to build your story around the actions of the characters.  As GM, don't create "stories", in which you decide what's going to happen, create "situations" - events just set in motion, an oily rag and a spark.  Make the situation relevant to the characters or best of all, let the players create the situation as they're creating characters.  Last, and most importantly, make sure the characters have ways to meaningfully affect the situation, in significant ways.  "Player choices matter" should be your mantra.<br/><br/><b>Bangs</b><br/><br/>There's an art to these, but the basic process is this: Find two things a character cares about, and make the character choose between them.  Make sure there's no "right" choice.  The character is protecting an orphanage from evil monsters, but they're ordered to return to base! The character is in love with someone, but the person is in league with their enemy!  Leave now or we'll kill the hostages!  Bangs are about bringing issues that are relevant to the character and the player into the game, and letting the player make a meaningful choice about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149531/#Comment_149531" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T04:02:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  4:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm.

A GM might expect the players to figure out the One Right Answer to his ingenious puzzle and punish all other attempted solutions.  A player with detailed knowledge of the setting might reject a newbie's ideas because they're contradicted by information in a setting sourcebook somewhere.  Stuff like this can be intensely frustrating to the player who's trying to contribute, especially if they're new to the game or new to role-playing.  It leads to social tension and resentment that can be poisonous if left unspoken.<br/><br/>Instead, recognize when someone is trying to make a creative contribution, and try to help them get their idea into the story rather than trying to block it out.  As they say in improv theater, never say "No": say "Yes, and..." or "Yes, but..." so that you can build on each others' ideas.  If your vision doesn't match mine, we should negotiate and try to meet in the middle.  Everyone will be less frustrated, and the story we create will be more interesting for having multiple authors and not just one.<br/><br/>This applies to players and GMs equally, but in a typical game the GM has a lot more power to squash ideas and therefore has to be more careful about using that power for good instead of evil.<br/><br/><b>Resolve out-of-character conflicts out-of-character</b><br/><br/>If somebody is doing something that is destroying the fun of the game for you -- the party rogue keeps stabbing you in the back, the players keep killing your important NPCs before they can give out the clues, etc -- I'm not talking anymore about creative contributions that you could accept and build on, I'm talking about stuff that makes you feel angry and disrespected and not want to play anymore -- if that happens, you need to pause the game and talk about it out-of-character.<br/><br/>What gamers will sometimes try to do in these situations is try to punish the <i>character</i>, by making house rules, or citing alignment restrictions to say "you can't do that", or imposing negative consequences in the game world for antisocial behavior.  <i>This does not work</i>.  The issue isn't a character choosing to behave badly.  The character doesn't exist.  The issue is that a player at the table is using the character as a blunt instrument to destroy other people's fun, and you need to find out why the player is doing that.  "It's what my character would do!" is not an excuse, because why has the player chosen to play a character who behaves that way?<br/><br/>Often it means that one player disagrees with the other players about the point of the game, or isn't interested in its premise, or has some other sort of creative disconnect which is preventing him or her from buying in to the story.  You need to find that out so you can either get everybody on the same page, or rethink the premise of the game to one that everyone is interested in, or decide not to play that particular game with that particular person anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149622/#Comment_149622" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T09:27:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My tried and true one as a "Story Gamer GM" (whatever that means):<br/><br/><b>Have players take on the roles of major NPCs</b><br/><br/>Now, I've seen that advice, and have even seen it in some AD&amp;D 2e supplements even, but I've rarely seen it <i>with teeth</i>. Usually the advice comes down to, "ask the players to take on minor roles like barkeeps or merchants".  Recently, in some of my games I've handed out minor, as well as major NPC roles (including villains, hero NPCs, major background characters, etc to the players. Sometimes I even ask them if they want to volunteer before I simply point at a player at random (actually its quickly and subconsciously calculated on "who hasn't been in a scene for a bit; who looks like they might dig this role, etc") and say, "And that's when the Queen enters the chamber... My lady? What have you to say of these events?" or the like.<br/><br/>It's gold. Through this trick/action, I've improved my own skills as a GM. <br/>It trains me, as a GM, to accept player input, and to go with the flow of controlled chaos. When the player mapps out how major (traditioanlly GM-controlled) NPCs might think or act, I sometimes pick back up control later if there's a particular "text block" or "adventure required action" that must happen, but otherwise I incorporate like 90% of the player's input into that image of the character from that point going forward. <br/><br/>Also, as a GM, it allows you to<br/>*watch the proceedings as if you were watching a play, and since you are freed up (as you're not in character playing the major NPC) it can free up the mind to think ahead a few steps. Stuff like, "What could happen next that would be awesome?"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149634/#Comment_149634" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T09:50:56+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would people be cool with some of these ending up on the <a href="/codex/" rel="nofollow">Codex</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149712/#Comment_149712" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T12:45:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:45PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Would people be cool with some of these ending up on the<a href="http:///codex/" rel="nofollow">Codex</a>?</blockquote>\nI think that would be awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149733/#Comment_149733" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:13:06+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5746&amp;page=1#Item_39" rel="nofollow">Gamer Skills</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149799/#Comment_149799" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T15:07:58+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  3:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Oh shoot!
