After three years of play and 60+ PC casualties, the players have founded a knight's order and established a stronghold (the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief). Some have managed to advance a second character to name level (though they only ever get to play one at a time).<br/> <br/>I'm absolutely thrilled by the campaign's success but I'm also encountering some high-level concerns. I'd like to ask you for advice and your own experiences with high-level play.<br/> <br/>a) The characters have amassed a huge number of magic items. <br/> <br/>I'm actually okay with valued NPC retainers and new PCs being outfitted with magic swords, but I feel that <b>the bookkeeping required is slowing us down</b>. A dedicated player handles this via Excel sheets, but there's still a lot of discussion on optimization at the table (\u201cGary's fighter gets the +3 sword tonight, so Vicky's NPC bodyguard can have his flail\u201d etc.).<br/> <br/>Also, I doubt that even a TPK would make things simple again: The next crew of starting characters would be admitted into the order and outfitted by the remaining high-level characters with what's still left in the vaults.<br/><br/>b) The characters have mountains of cash to spend.<br/><br/>Most of that cash is spent on recovering from missions (de-petrifying PCs etc.) and expanding the stronghold, but that still leaves tens of thousands of gold pieces on the table, so the <b>players naturally ask: \u201cWhat kind of magic items can we buy?\u201d</b> <br/><br/>I don\u2019t want to run a magic item shop, or hand out a price list. The players are understanding about this and don\u2019t prod hard and I occasionally cook up some offers at outrageous prices but it\u2019s a fair question.<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>I'm already reducing the amount of magic items in treasure hoards and I'm considering a sort of "death tax", namely requiring a proper tomb for all name-level casualties (to drain the party's coffers and to explain all those dungeons in the Wilderlands). <br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>Other than that, things are going well. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by how well low- and high-level characters play together: the XP progression enables new characters to catch up quickly, but they still have to weather a few fights, usually in the second row, and hope they don\u2019t get wasted by a fireball or cloudkill.<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/><br/>Johann                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466820/#Comment_466820" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T09:41:20+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  9:41AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like your problem is... you still play low level dungeon survival adventures, while the party is backed by high level resources.<br/>This fucks up the survival part of the game, in turn increasing even more the already disproportionate pool of resources at their disposal.<br/>Also, the Players seem to be running the high level characters as a bank-extention of their new low level PCs, rather than actual guild masters.<br/><br/>You could offer the players an interesting option, if you are up for the extra work.<br/>Play on a global scale <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Start defining and moving around big political powers: overbearing kings, competing guilds, inter reign conflicts.<br/>IF the Players are on board with this, then go crazy.<br/>Offer them guild-level problems and opportunities, make sure they are not allowed to just ignore them. Want to support the red king? Fine. Want to support the blue king? Fine. Want to stay out of it? Nope, sorry, you can try, you can not pick a side, but then both kings might see you as a threat, a wild card, and act accordingly.<br/><br/>This should keep the high level characters busy.<br/>Make magical items largely irrelevant (a +4 flaming sword is perfectly useless during a diplomatic negotiation, unless you intend to chop your way into open war).<br/>Keep their money well spent, as large numbers of npcs have a big cost to hire, train, feed, equip... and then you might want ships, siege weaponry, more strongholds.<br/><br/>And hey... what about the people LIVING in your territory?<br/>Are they happy with your government? And taxes? And how you put them in danger by waging war to opponent Orders, Guilds, Reigns, etc?<br/><br/>Just, treat all this stuff as adventure material, not as a "punishment" to force them into spending money uselessly. Make the ball roll, and then follow it wherever it might lead. Just like in a normal adventure.<br/><br/>This might completely supplant your usual dungeon-level play. Or be mixed in between it.<br/>Also it might offer you easy new ideas for the low-level team... that instead of facing yet another random dungeon, might be sent on special missions by the high level characters, now too busy/important to take personal care of small/dangerous tasks <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466821/#Comment_466821" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T10:19:54+00:00" title="October  6, 2017 10:19AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no experience whatsoever with high-level play. The highest I've ever GMed has been 7th level, and the highest average level has been more like 3rd.<br/><br/>That said, my choice about the mountains of cash situation is simply to deviate from Gygax and introduce other kinds of goals (and xp rewards for the same) for medium to high level characters. This is more true to life and life-relevant themes anyway - who actually in this world is an important person <i>and</i> runs heists on ruined dungeons? Where do you find these dungeons with ever-increasingly large hoards of money? People with real power should be working on much more fundamental types of wealth and power than gold pieces: military power, political legitimacy, spiritual insight, tax base and such. If the characters aren't interested, I'd just retire them - there's more 1st-levelers where these came from, no reason to pretend that high-level play is the same as low-level play.<br/><br/>As regards magic items, no way around that unless you want to introduce streamlined rules. If I personally had the situation where players are using Excel to optimize gear, and they really have an excess of everything, I'd just introduce a new type of high-level magical practice or rules simplification that replaces and converts all that gear into something more manageable.<br/><br/>An arbitrary example of such would be the 4th edition D&amp;D thing: let PCs grind down their magic items into magic dust that can be used to enchant new magic items. Once they grind everything down to empower a few high-level items, it'll all be much more manageable again. Instead of alchemical grinding you could do sacrificing to the gods, of course, for the same effect.<br/><br/>Another example would be to introduce the concept of "magic gear harmonization", a type of magical practice where a character trains to use a given set of gear to its optimal effectiveness; a combination of procedural abstraction and in-fiction magical art, essentially. The idea would be to reduce book-keeping, so you'd just use a simple formula to figure out a "harmonized magic bonus" for the entire set of equipment, and use that in lieu of the particulars of their magical items. For example, you could say that a character practicing this stuff gets a magic bonus equal to their highest single item bonus, plus one, and this is used for everything they do instead of utilizing the specific particular powers of their equipment; in this situation you'd only need to know the most powerful single item each character is using to know what level of magical potency they're bringing to various situations. (I suppose you'd also want to know what utility powers they have, but those could be handled like simple spell lists under this rubric, rather than tracking the various special activation procedures and limitations that each item has. Just list everything your gear can do, and treat it all as spells-known for simplicity's sake.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466822/#Comment_466822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T10:40:43+00:00" title="October  6, 2017 10:40AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2017 10:47AM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a hell of a long time since I played D&amp;D but,...<br/><br/>If they started a knightly order and maintain a stronghold, they must owe fealty to someone, unless the order has no formal recognition and the stronghold is in the middle of nowhere.  Overlords demand knights'-service, which costs time and money.  Overlords also want tax revenues.<br/><br/>Characters with that much wealth and power are often involved in wars.  Make some of those happen in the campaign.<br/><br/>Strongholds need soldiers, blacksmiths, and other tradesmen to maintain them.  A wily band of adventurers can't hope to hold onto a stronghold by themselves, especially if they are also out adventuring.  These people cost money too.  And feeding them requires farmers to raise food, or supply trains to import food.<br/><br/>High-level characters definitely require tombs appropriate to their status--agreed.<br/><br/>Buying magic?  From whom?  Are magic items of the kind that high-level characters are after ever for sale?  There's a quest right there: collecting all the rare objects needed by your magic users to make worthwhile magic items.<br/><br/>Also, if they have reached high-level, they should be attracting the attention of some extremely powerful baddies by now.  You know the baddies who were manipulating all the lesser-evil that the adventurers have been defeating.  They are probably pissed at the PCs now, after so many dungeons have been emptied, etc.  Big baddies can't be hurt by +3 magic swords...  It's time to start epic play, hero-questy stuff, world changing threats, errands of the gods kind of stuff.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Ask the players about the book-keeping.  It might be part of the fun for them.  If it is not, have it all done before the session starts.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466823/#Comment_466823" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T11:12:56+00:00" title="October  6, 2017 11:12AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I started writing and there were no comments here.

Do you/they want to manage large estates and become powerful magnates, or do you/they want these high-level characters to achieve epic-mythic status?  There's been good advice here for taking your campaign in either direction.  I'm not sure it has to be an either/or decision, you could try both (but that it might not work).  But what I'm hearing from everyone here, is that you have to racket up the difficulty, make the threats more dangerous, complex, and higher-order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466873/#Comment_466873" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-07T19:45:03+00:00" title="October  7, 2017  7:45PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2017 7:55PM by Johann.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The campaign has a lot of t<b>he content you guys suggest for high levels</b>: The party has recently had its first military engagement (300 men of their newly minted militia versus a frost giant warband, using a mass combat system), is currently considering a diplomatic mission to an amazon queen in the North and engages with level-appropriate challenges: when they retrieved their best sword from the Underdark \u2013 where it has to recharge periodically \u2013 they had a random encounter with an Aboleth which was the closest to a TPK we\u2019ve seen in 25 sessions. Also, a legendary lich they pissed off has promised to tear down their fortress \u201cwithin the next year\u201d and there are only about twenty days left for that\u2026 (I rolled a d360 and the result was almost the maximum).<br/><br/>That said, <b>commando operations are still the core of the game</b>. I\u2019m actually relieved to find that the characters\u2019 personal involvement continues to be relevant. In a less fantastic game they would probably spend most of their time scheming and commanding armies, but high-level monsters and high-level characters are like modern tanks would be on a medieval battlefield: They can pretty much ignore or mow down regular troops or monsters and can only be challenged by their own kind. Unhittable ACs, magic weapon needed to hit, area attacks that annihilate lesser units and can quickly send other such units flying, and so forth. <br/><br/>Similar to what Eero suggests, <b>they do not advance by gold anymore</b>, or gold alone at any rate. They need to complete \u201cquests\u201d or \u201cgreat quests\u201d, i.e. adventures that are the stuff of song or even legend. I offer various modules placed in the Wilderlands (Against the Giants, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks etc.) and they also negotiate stuff with me (\u201cWould permanently destroying that lich count as a quest?\u201d).<br/><br/>That said, such quests generate the aforementioned mountains of cash \u2013 and need to do so, too, so as to allow lower-level characters to advance.<br/><br/>As far as expanding their stronghold is concerned, I am mostly winging it at the moment. I use D&amp;D\u2019s stronghold construction costs as a guideline (200,000 gp for a small castle, I think). <b>As I do not wish to add to the bookkeeping, I won\u2019t touch upkeep, taxes and such</b>. Right now, <b>I\u2019m looking for some kind of system to price military units etc. with a lump sum</b> (like many computer games). How much should they lay out to permanently establish a second heavy cavalry unit (10 horses, plate etc.)? Any pointers or suggestions?<br/><br/>Eero\u2019s pointer to <b>the D&amp;D 4e thing sounds very promising</b>! As above, I\u2019m unsure of the appropriate balance / math (i.e. how many +1 swords make a +2 sword) but I could  probably crack out my 3e DMG for that (which also covers tons of utility items which are no longer present in 4e). <br/><br/>Speaking of utility powers: Most of the complexity comes from that and this stuff is hard to streamline (I feel that referring to spells won\u2019t work). <b>On the one hand, it\u2019s cool when a player remembers an exotic item on page three of the party\u2019s Excel sheets. On the other hand, it bogs down play when players are perusing these lists for just about any situation.</b> <br/><br/>To be fair, they often don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a serious situation or not \u2013 often I don\u2019t, either, because I try hard not to anticipate likely outcomes (avoiding teleological thinking, as Eero might put it?). That aboleth didn\u2019t look so bad on paper, for instance. [ADDED: ... i.e., I only took one brief glance at its stats when putting it on the encounter table, never stopping to consider the implications of meeting the thing while traveling in a boat on a river in the dark -- as indeed I don't want to!] <br/><br/>As for <b>handing out jobs to groups of low-level adventurers (PCs or NPCs): I really wish they did that! </b>Any idea on how to foster that sort of thing? They\u2019ve been talking about clearing out a nearby castle ruin that, while showing signs of being haunted, has not posed any threat. It\u2019s filled with low-level monsters, but right now they\u2019re thinking of going in with their A-team.<br/><br/>Thank you for all your answers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466874/#Comment_466874" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-07T20:15:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2017  8:15PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sound of your campaign. It's wonderful that you've gotten to name levels in the first place, and the game sounds quite fun.<br/><br/>In our campaigns high-level characters have had that tendency to retreat to the background in favor of letting low-levelers adventure. I think that the one big fat reason for this has been that character advancement has not been at all even with us: usually some characters "rocket away", while others die and the players start again from the bottom. This creates a natural dynamic where a mid-level character will go to extended downtime, perhaps patronize some new adventurers, and wait for more characters to get to their level so they can tackle level-appropriate challenges.<br/><br/>A related phenomenon is that mid-level characters often "leave the party" in the sense of abandoning their old adventuring companions to pursue their personal interests. This means that an "all-star" adventure with a full roster of mid-level characters is simply not very common; it's much more usual to see one mid-leveler leading a bunch of low-levelers. The players bring their best team only to adventures that have solid fictional reasons for every character to care (by somebody bribing the others if nothing else works).<br/><br/>One reason that mid-level characters have to forego adventuring for a time is that I like to provide the players with meaningful downtime options. If you want to do the spell research or keep-building or intrigue setup or training or whatever, you'll have to commit the time, and that means no adventuring for the duration. This naturally means that the players will shuffle through their roster as they leave characters to deal with their downtime projects.

They can only have one adventure per season of year, or something. However, if they auction out an adventure to others, the two can occur simultaneously.

You get to do cool stuff that feels like it's breaking the rules! You'll actually be able to go to level nine of the dungeon without pretty much being guaranteed to have someone hit zero! What makes it work (so far\u2014we've got several level 8 characters, with level 9s coming up in a few months most likely, several demi-humans have retired at their max level or are putting that decision off slightly right now) is the knowledge that this doesn't last forever. Winning eventually takes you out of the game.<br/><br/>Some tools:\n<ul><li><p>Magic items are special and powerful and cursed and have wills of their own. All of your fav source material is full of this. Also, Old-school is about property and capital. An easily solution instead of awkward attunement processes: if a specific character doesn't claim a magic item within a week we start to roll to see if it goes missing. The better the item the more likely this is to happen (on the Swords &amp; Wizardry tables we handily have things divided up into minor, medium, major\u2014just give them 1/6 per week for each category). Characters are known by what they have and use. Back-up plans are what the magic-user is there for.</p>\n<p>Secondly: you don't loan these out. A major solo violinist doesn't loan out their fiddle\u2014although they might use an ancient one given to them for a long-term period as a quest from a great collector of magic. Giving is giving, and if there are conditions they carry the weight of a curse. You don't want to curse your friends just to get your flail back\u2014or no, even better, do you?</p></li>\n<li><p>Spend the money: we use a variant of the popular jrients carousing rules which accelerates advancement but also really encourages spending. This was one of the building blocks of my game when I first started looking at OSR stuff, but its been expanded a lot. We use variants of the same rules for hiring sages or spies, library research, magic research, building castles, hiring henchpeople, and now even sponsoring new characters (roll the carousing dice and give xp to a newly-introduced character instead of yourself, get them to level two if they are lucky so they will survive one battle).</p>\n<p>There's a decent historical case that carousing was in some sense \u201cmeant\u201d to be in the game, but in any case it solves a big part of all this to conceive of levelling up as related to impressing people by behaving lavishly, and so to tie it to spending the money as much or more than getting it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Where else do you spend the money? Deals. If you want to bribe an npc, we have a system based on swords &amp; wizardry treasure hoards\u2014to get something good out of a lord or important monster, you'll have to be spending 4\u201310 thousand coins or giving up magic.</p>\n<p>But there's other places too. A good thing that happened was a level five magic-user owing a were-geld of 30,000 coins at one point. Since they died before repaying it, the person in charge of collecting has since become obsessed with it and a result was cursed to become a Gold Dragon which years later killed a bunch of level-seven party members. Good times! Also, a dwarf built a flying ship fuelled by a dragon's spirit that demands increasing payments to use it so we regularly spend about a grand per week just to sail. Speaking of which:</p></li>\n<li>Level limits are good, actually. If you make them good. For us: a level-five equivalent Halfling is a leprechaun who might grant one wish before they disappear forever. A level seven-equivalent Dwarf can make any magic item before they leave play\u2014a basic one no questions asked, but for something special, expect to throw a bunch of things you found into the forge.</li>\n<li>Retirement takes magic items out of the game. You may leave one of your magic items to each of your henchfolk, and then take one of them over as your new PC. The rest go with you as you get to do your demi-human thing or become a lord sympathetic to the party.</li>\n<li>I've considered a version of the funeral rule\u2014as you die (we have a phase where you get a chance to speak before rolling your last save) you can name the recipients of your magic items if you want. But perhaps those you don't give away then should really belong with you in the grave, and to despoil that risks bringing a curse down upon them? The best curses are ones that are worth bearing, anyway...</li>\n<li>If your version of D&amp;D doesn't have the constitution drain from AD&amp;D's <em>Raise Dead</em>, it's one of the only silly AD&amp;D complications that you actually want, IMO. Actually, make it better: a system shock check is a 2d6 roll against your new constitution, and when someone fails an undead monster of equivalent HD (expect mostly spectres) comes into the world instead. That monster has all of their stuff now.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466897/#Comment_466897" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-09T05:21:43+00:00" title="October  9, 2017  5:21AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb" rel="nofollow">adamwb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Level limits are good, actually.

I have the sense that some D&amp;D texts have somewhat funky economics, but at least in our games stuff costs a lot of money, and there's a huge amount of stuff you tend to want.

In DCC's "Doom of the Savage Kings" module, for example, the big baddie carries off a villager every night like Grendel and can only be hurt by a spear the PCs must retrieve. With attunement, you'd have to weather another week of killings and the consequences of the spear's wielder being killed by the beast would be bad indeed. Note that's not an argument against attunement per se, just the realization that some modules might become more difficult.<br/><br/>Attunement would prevent the constant exchange of equipment but I'm sure the players would have henchmen attune to their back catalogue of items which would add some bookkeeping. Who knows when you need that ring of controlling aquatic creatures, right?<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>The suggestion of "<b>meaningful downtime activities</b>" has been a bit of an eye-opener because my thinking about this has been ... confused (i.e. I've vacillated between punishing/discouraging such things, afraid of everyone suddenly going off at the same time, and incentivising/hoping for it). I guess it's time for a clear pro-downtime stance and attractive options! Do you guys determine up front how long something takes, and if so, is there a randomizer (e.g. 2d6 months)? Or do you roll every month/season/year to see if the PC has achieved his objective?<br/><br/>As far as time management is concerned, I'm using a modified Greyhawk calendar and mark off a week for practically anything anyone does. Ask about rumors regarding the nymph in the lake? One week. Order ten healing potions? One week. I do this even if the activity would realistically only tie up a single character or take only a day. The reason is that I want more time to pass and the rationale is that we do not register tons of little stuff like social calls, keeping in shape, enjoying life as a lord and so on (which would take up a lot of time, presumably).<br/><br/>I started to enforce this a bit late, so the characters have attained name level in the span of three years of in-game time. Ouch.<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>I also like the cash-in-your-character options!<br/><br/>I've got some stuff (chisel a statue to awaken a new dwarf, for instance, or pour your essence into the making of an artifact), but it's too abstract, not compelling or simply too far off (maximum level). Creating attractive, gameable options as regards <i>the campaign at large</i> is darn cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466924/#Comment_466924" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-10T20:11:00+00:00" title="October 10, 2017  8:11PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do you guys determine up front how long something takes, and if so, is there a randomizer (e.g. 2d6 months)?

It's sort of like we have the magic research game and the manor management game and the shopkeeping game and whatever, and they're structurally independent of each other, only being connected by the basic task resolution language and the fictional real measures like time and money and such.<br/><br/>I'll also mention for clarity's sake that I've settled on tracking time in days: I basically have a running timeline with one sheet per month in my GMing folder where I keep track of both future events and on-going events (the same calendar serves as my campaign notes, pretty much). This means that I don't have a real structural preference for the time units being used. I'd probably jump up to tracking months instead of days if the players weren't constantly doing tactical time-scale things.<br/><br/>As an example, the magic research system I usually use is very much a "roll to find out how long it takes" thing. To be specific, it's a success-accumulating system: you need to accumulate a certain number of successful rolls that depends on the scope of the project, with the difficulty depending on the complexity of the magic, and the time and money spent per roll depending on the mode of activity (so e.g. book research is cheaper than alchemy, and so on). Basic spell research occurs with the basic time-unit being a week, and we basically progress with the research roll by roll, time-unit by time unit, until something happens to interrupt the project or the project itself succeeds or fails or whatnot.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, my manor-management subgame is very much a calendar-based thing because of how the agricultural cycle over a year works: there are certain types of decisions that you make every season, and certain costs and payouts that the system produces. For example, workforce is paid annually and supplied seasonally, animals multiply in the spring, the harvest comes in the fall and so forth. You can make decisions and prepate to execute maneuvers in advance, and that can modify certain rolls, but ultimately time in this subsystem is calculated seasonally.<br/><br/>So no real rhyme or reason to this, really. The systems develop pretty organically because I couldn't possibly know what the players will be interested in pursuing in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466980/#Comment_466980" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-13T09:37:05+00:00" title="October 13, 2017  9:37AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Along the same lines as the attunment <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> mentioned, AD&amp;D 1E had intelligent weapons.  I don't know if it was carried forward to later editions or was in the original, but you could use them to make the swapping of weapons and armour more difficult.  IMO, all or most weapons +3 or better should be intelligent with egos, and alignments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466991/#Comment_466991" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-13T18:13:17+00:00" title="October 13, 2017  6:13PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2017 6:13PM by adamwb.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AD&amp;D actually makes those swords much more rare than OD&amp;D, and lots of retro clones also deemphasize them comparatively (not sure about DCC specifically). In OD&amp;D all swords have alignments, at least 50% of swords are intelligent, and fully 10% of them have special purposes. This is largely good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
