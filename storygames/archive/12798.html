Do you think it's possible to go overboard in designing rituals for a game? I've had a look at the opening ritual section of Society of Dreamers and I liked it, but I wondered how you found the right balance for it.  What would it look like if it were too much? How do you recognize when you have too much ritual, or not enough?<br/><br/>Also, I think the format is okay, and the content is okay too. I guess I'd like to see more concrete examples of the design element you're talking about being used right and being used wrong. Reading about something only in the abstract can lead you to a vague sense like, "Yeah I think I understand..." when really you don't -- you just think about it for a bit and then it slips out of your mind a while later, unless you yourself try to pin it down, ask questions, and get a handle on what you're reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288116/#Comment_288116" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T08:14:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  8:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, good call on the examples. I'll put some in.<br/><br/>With the rituals, I guess it's a matter of taste and testing. If it were too much, for me, I'd notice because I'd get impatient during the rituals, thinking "why are we doing this rubbish when we're here to play". The rituals in SoD are very short. Long rituals would displace the balance, making the game less important. <br/><br/>The rituals in SoD don't break up the game - they're at the beginning and end, like bookends. (Of course, that's a lie. The game itself <i>is</i> a ritual, clearly, with sub-rituals: The dream scenes, for example, and the cooperative creation of the mnemosite, which leads to the creature seemingly taking on a life of its own. Chaos magicians could definitely play the game with intent to create a servitor. I don't, though.)<br/><br/>All in all, rituals are techniques just like everything else you use in a game; so it's hard to answer the question except to say what works for your group, works for your group. Just like "what's the right amount of dice-rolling", for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288118/#Comment_288118" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T08:33:31+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  8:33AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Right, good call on the examples.

If I say, "I hit with my sword," and you say, "Okay, roll d20 plus your base attack rating," is that a ritual? It certainly happens a lot when you're playing D&amp;D, and it provides a certain rhythm you come to expect from every session of the game. What makes something a ritual vs. some other game mechanic? Does it only have to do with beginnings and endings of a play session?<br/><br/>One example of a ritual that didn't feel like a ritual to me (but still worked to the same effect) was when I ran a game of Mouse Guard, in the beginning of each session after the first, one of the players is supposed to recap what happened in the previous adventure. Nothing in the book tells us we have to do this, but the rules offer a reward to the person who does, so of course it happens. I think this kind of opening ritual offers a clear incentive, which somehow makes it feel more natural and less like, "okay, now it's time to do the opening ritual everybody!"<br/><br/>Also, a common closing ritual, not only in Mouse Guard but in many other games, is to divvy up experience or other reward points earned in the process of playing the game. In Mouse Guard specifically, the process of going through to see if you acted for your belief or against it, for instance, actually helps you review the most important events of the game for you and your character, as well as for other characters. It's sort of an instant-recap of the highlights as something for you to take away. <br/><br/>Apocalypse World also has a special ending move that requires every player to "choose a character who knows you better than they used to...." In the special "Hx" mechanic of Apocalypse World, giving someone this kind of knowledge of your character can sometimes be like an extra experience point, which helps them to advance more quickly. So in a way, it's like players giving one another experience, except that it's tied to the fiction of the game and the changing relationships of the characters.<br/><br/>What do you think of these sorts of rituals that people don't even call rituals most of the time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288137/#Comment_288137" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T11:14:01+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 11:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my personal opinion (I say this because, well, there are a lot of opinions on what a ritual is - on this forum alone), just about everything can be called a ritual. (And a game. And art. So many terms are hard to define.) But when it comes to role-playing games, there are some distinctions I tend to draw:<br/><br/>- Do we do it every time? Does the session/social event feel like it lacks something, if we don't perform this thing?<br/>- Is it something that doesn't actually create something new in the fiction? <br/>- Is it a social thing, something we do together? <br/><br/>If so, I'm more likely to call it a ritual.<br/><br/>So when we eat dinner before the game, and towards the end of dinner, I say: "Okay, let's get ready for the game", that's ritual. <br/><br/>I'd also say that if we always have a Big Battle, and we <i>know</i> that the outcome is "the heroes win and the bad guys all die", that's a sort of ritual. It doesn't actually create anything new in the fiction - it just recreates something that we always need to be present.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288158/#Comment_288158" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T14:04:23+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  2:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rather than saying what is or is not a ritual, I think it's more useful to think about what we learn from thinking about something as a ritual.

I can think of no way you could make it any better.<br/><br/>Now, back to actual discussion...<br/>As someone who's played <i>Society of Dreamers</i> quite a lot, I'd like to point out to everyone that the "rituals" in this game are <b>different</b> from any other "ritualistic" behavior I ever encountered in roleplaying games. Different from the examples Matthijs himself gave two posts above, different from the very ritualized game mechanics in <i>Polaris</i>...<br/>And the difference is that SoD rituals <b>seem to imply</b> supernatural consequence in-real-life. This is never <i>stated</i>, but there is a strong <i>suggestion</i> of otherwise undefined "spirits" somehow interacting with the play of the game.<br/>The use of a Ouija board definitely unsettles some players at least a little, and the opening/closing ritual is easily rationalized as a way to make the Ouija thing "safe" \u2014 which of course just becomes a confirmation that it is, indeed, supposed to be dangerous. Much like when enacting a s\xe9ance at a party, people are prompted to partially suspend their disbelief and to set themselves up to be easily scared (in the name of having fun, of course).<br/>The second opening ritual is modeled after "serious" meditation exercises used as part of "spiritual" practices, thus carrying an underlying suggestion that maybe the author believes such things. It's pretty relaxing and sort-of reassuring. In context, it prompts people to let go and open up: what's going to happen can't be bad, it suggests, but you have "let" it happen.<br/><br/>My point is: while mechanically optional (they could be done away with and the coherence of the game-design would hold), the rituals in SoD are in my eyes a clever and deliberate technique to affect the participants in the "metaplay" level (as defined by Tobias Wrigstad et al.), putting them all "in the right mood" for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288200/#Comment_288200" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T23:17:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 11:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2010 11:22PM by Matthijs.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu is spot on.

I told the player: <b>\xabTake the sun in your hand.\xbb</b> She described the sun turning into a gold coin in her hand, and was therefore told to gift it to the soldier.<br/><br/>We knew that "sitting on a bench by the door, as if waiting for her" was a reference to her childhood scene, btw... I suggest you perform this sort of reincorporation (only) when you want to mark that the dream is something personal to your character \u2014 as opposed to something personal for <i>the Dreamer</i>. It was effectively like turning the Dreamer's dream into the Diver's dream, either showing that the Mnemosite is a linking force transcending the singular human being, or maybe that the Diver was a Dreamer herself.<br/>When the Dreamer in the sequence is also a player character, you additionally have the option of reincorporating material from <i>his</i> childhood and youth sequences, which I recommend you do most of the time and I don't think carries any drawbacks.<br/>Finally, the "gold coin" in the example exchange could also be read as a reference to a third player character -- not Diver nor Dreamer for that sequence.

So, during last session we had that dream sequence with labirynth made of living and breathing meat, and holes leading to different places, like diamond mine in Belgian Congo, where are diamonds huge like apples, and when the Diver took one, suddenly the blood started to flow from the walls, and so on. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>The problem I had was with instructions from other players. I'm trying to articulate what's the issue, but it's hard. I'm pretty sure it was NOT about deprotagonisation of Diver (who's not an agent on his own, but in a sense is reactive) - in SoD I had number of "dictated" Scenes, and they were fine. It could be, that simply that kind of "the dream diver never describes their own actions, and the other players don\u2019t describe the dream" is counterituitive for me. Or maybe it's just that "choose your own adventure books"-genre feeling?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288709/#Comment_288709" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T09:13:01+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  9:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Counterintuitive, yes, and very deliberately so I believe (am I right, Matthijs?).<br/>I tend to think of it as resembling Interactive Fiction, with the Diver player being the "game" and the other players inputing commands into the parser.

The child is reporting back, but what the fuck does he understand of R'Lyeh? Not much. So you're saying "pick up that, check out this, do this and that", because you're basically controlling the suit; the child says "I see this, this and this is happening".<br/><br/>The diver is their avatar.
