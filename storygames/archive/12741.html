Arnold and I had actually been chatting in the weeks leading up to the Con, and upon discovering a shared love for The Mountain Witch, we decided to mix peanut butter into our chocolate and use Annalise to play Mountain Witch. And it was incredibly great.<br/><br/>What did this entail? Well, in Mountain Witch you have these Dark Fates that you're supposed to keep secret. And in Annalise, each character has a Secret. In Mountain Witch, you play a group of ronin going up Mt. Fuji to confront O-Yanma, the Mountain Witch. In Annalise, there is a malevolent force that is drawn to the characters, and which the characters will end up confronting...<br/><br/>It was actually a really solid fit. Instead of writing our own Secrets, we just each drew a Dark Fate card; we all started with the assumption that O-Yanma was the Vampire in our story, and we started the game by introducing our characters as they arrived at the foot of the mountain. Arnold and I have both run Mountain Witch a number of times, and we each have "stock" scenes that we like to include - due to how scene-framing and adding narrative elements via Claims works in Annalise, we were both able to put in some of our favorite bits. <br/><br/>I played Tanoshi, a grim, young warrior with no swords who had been banished by his lord, with the only way to regain his honor involving bringing his lord the head of the Witch. Arnold played Watashi, an older Ronin who couldn't remember much of his past and was nominally simply looking for the reward. Our other player played Santo, a gluttonous and therefore weak Ronin who was trying to regain and prove his strength.<br/><br/>One cool thing about Annalise is that you (can easily) create this written record of what happened in play. I'm not going to reproduce the whole thing here, but some of the entries that were particularly momentous:<br/><br/>- The Witch learns something that Watashi can't remember he knows<br/><br/>- The Tengu strikes Santo blind<br/><br/>- The (enormous) spider lays eggs in Tanoshi's arm (thankfully this ended up not coming to pass!)<br/><br/>- Watashi is the last to reach O-Yanma<br/><br/>- Yuki-Ona (the female winter spirit) gives Santo a Tengu mask that cannot be removed<br/><br/>- Tanoshi see's his wife's face one last time <br/><br/>Over the course of the play, we learned that Watashi was seeking someone in particular (due to his memories starting to come back) and that Tanoshi couldn't care less about his companions. In an entirely unforseen, but really deeply meaningful (to me) series of events, Santo was struck blind by a Tengu, but was actually the first to reach the Witch, and struck him down! Tanoshi, who had been seeking revenge for his wife's death at the hands of the witch, did end up taking the head back to his lord, but forever scarred by it's face transforming into that of his dead wife. We ended the game with Santo stumbling off the mountain, a half-broken Tengu mask grafted to his face (IIRC) after having been made to suffer by the NEW Witch - Watashi! <br/><br/>It was a really deeply satisfying game of Annalise, and it was probably my best single-session play of the game to date! Due to exhaustion, we only had one confrontation scene each, and that's the only place where I would have wanted a little more play - maybe two scenes each, to kind of set up the big finale and then execute it, but given the circumstances I really can't complain.<br/><br/>Arnold is a foreshadowing machine (he subtly used Outcomes to point to things to come later, like an early Achievement of "Watashi does not have to face the spider"). Our third player picked up the game easily and quickly, contributed a ton, and was just an all-around good guy to have at the table. We had a little bit of expectation clash due to our knowledge of Mountain Witch tropes (like, the Mountain Witch is assumed to be male, stuff like that), but nothing that took more than a minute of conversation to iron out.<br/><br/>I'm very happy that we pulled this game together, it was great fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286457/#Comment_286457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T12:32:25+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 12:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott was our third man.

Yes. He's a good guy, I'm glad we got to play.<br/><br/>Tanoshi's was desperately in love - I spun it into "I can never reveal that my true honor will only be regained by avenging my wife's death at the hands of the Mountain Witch," or something like that. I didn't want to be in love with the Witch. I think it would have been stronger in a longer-term game - as it was, I was happy to support the more direct agendas of the two other players and have my guy kinda be the "oh-he-needs-his-honor-back" guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
