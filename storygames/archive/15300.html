Because it's important! Well, you know. <br/><br/>Which got me thinking: I start a lot of things, and some of them get done. If I could find the relevant factors - what causes a game idea to sink or float? - maybe this could be helpful in getting things done.<br/><br/>So - in your personal experience - what has caused your projects (game publication or otherwise) to fail? And what has caused them to succeed? I'm mainly talking about semi-large-scale projects here - things that may require months from start to finish.<br/><br/>I've got a few factors I'm pretty sure of, for myself:<br/><br/><b>Yes factors</b><br/>There is available time and energy.

I had an idea for a game called <i>Gang War</i>, which would be about being in a gang and having to live with extreme violence, and deciding whether to try and get out or to take over. I was super-excited about it, wrote down a few pages of notes, then kind of started to lose steam... and now three, four months have passed, and I've moved on to a Middle-Earth design.<br/>Likely, I'll incorporate some of the less-bizarre elements of <i>Gang War</i> into other things, but then again I may pick it up and subtly slip the idea into a Story Games thread and see if anyone bites. Heh. <br/>Actually, I think that social exposure is a big part of whether I keep going on a project - - I get the initial boost from inspiration, and then when I tell someone else about my idea and they are interested or excited, I get another boost that helps me keep going, possibly long enough to get to play-testing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347612/#Comment_347612" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T06:26:53+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  6:26AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in two minds about talking about projects in public.

At that point, It's easier if you have someone to collaborate on this (see: Luke + BWHQ; Evil Hat; Jason + Steve, Sage + Adam, etc.).<br/>-- Outside feedback can often be a distraction as people try to please or communicate with their audience prematurely, before the game is really finished.<br/>-- Publishing is a hard road and you kinda have to let everyone make mistakes and publish a game that's not quite ready, at least the first time.  I'm not sure there's any other way to have those experiences, however much you might want to help someone.<br/>-- Playtesting is a test run for actual publication.  If nobody wants to playtest you game, few people are going to want to buy and play it either.  You do not "deserve" other people's attention: it's your responsibility to make something that's interesting.  Talking about your game to an uninterested audience is annoying rather than promotional and hurts your game in the long run.<br/>-- Finally, a lot of folks like designing games much more than they like publishing them, especially if they don't have any experience in publishing.  There's a huge amount of room in indie publishing for folks who want to help publish other folks' games.  The stuff that Evil Hat (Do, Penny) and Galileo Games (Nothing, Shelter) have done is just the tip of the iceberg, in this regard.  The easiest way to encourage people to publish may be to walk them through the process and do it with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347634/#Comment_347634" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T09:49:08+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  9:49AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ((Nice topic.

I'm well aware of this however and have recently taken some precautions. Here's a quick idea...<br/><br/>YES<br/>- The project is small enough that a one-man design team can finish it within about 30 man-hours.<br/>- Like Mr. Walton, I've been trying to create "bite-sized" projects lately, micro-games that leave a lot of assumption to the experienced player (ala Lady Blackbird for example)<br/>- Probably most important for long-term projects is having someone else who's excited and wants to participate. Unfortunately, all of my players are much more interested in playing the game than discussing design ideas, so I'm typically on my own<br/><br/>NO<br/>- The project is too ambitious and requires too many man-hours for me alone<br/>- Pretty much everything Christopher Weeks said<br/>- It also probably doesn't help that I tend to shift my focus from hobbie to hobbie. If I don't like spending a lot of time in Word/Open Office/Photoshop, I'm probably trying my hand at video-game programming and art or working on music projects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347637/#Comment_347637" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T10:00:41+00:00" title="November  2, 2011 10:00AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm mainly talking about semi-large-scale projects here - things that may require months from start to finish.</blockquote>\nI'd like to focus on this.

Unless you have a narrow-drive and a lot of time to devote, it's tough to finish a large project by yourself. Having other people to work with is imperative. <br/><br/>The ability to come back to a project months later and reinvigorate your enthusiasm can also work too. Some of the larger projects that I've worked on (more than 100+ pages of content) were completed over the course of four or five stints.

The trick is to create your projects in such a way that the completion also represents a learning challenge. So, there's something about the printing, or promotion, or fulfillment, or marketing, that's also challenge. Maybe you're going to release it at a comic convention. Or you're going to do your first traditional print run.

Few people have enough raw willpower to persevere indefinitely without external validation.<br/>- You're asking for problems if you have tasks whose completion is contingent on things that are beyond your control or influence. Your momentum will be derailed, and you're likely to transfer your frustration with external people or things into unhappiness with the project itself.<br/>- There's a danger in committing yourself to doing tasks that you hate based on the belief that your desire to have the overall project completed will be strong enough to overcome your distaste for doing the task. A poison task is likely to sap your enthusiasm for the entire project, although you probably need to evaluate this concept in context to the overall project, poison is all about dosage.<br/>- It's a terrible idea to commit to overly aggressive schedules in an attempt to build support for the project. It will explode on you when you fail to do the impossible.<br/>- A lot of people do it, but it's a mistake to sandbag your schedule. When you give yourself permission to be lazy, you'll take it. Just like a gas expands to fill whatever container you put it in, a project expands to take all the time allotted to it.<br/>- If the project isn't getting done in the exact way you hoped, it's not a good idea to beat yourself up for being a fallible human being. Nobody's perfect, and if you're too hard on yourself you'll kill your morale.<br/>- If the project isn't getting done in the exact way you hoped, it's also not a good idea to make excuses for your failures or assign blame based on what makes you feel good. Being dishonest with yourself doesn't help you finish projects.<br/>- It's not a good idea to have no plan for how to get to completion. You need to know what completion looks like if you want to get there.<br/>- It's also not a good idea to have a plan that's so rigid that you can't adapt to the realities you learn about when actually working on the project.<br/>- Don't believe that planning is a good unto itself, i.e. don't believe that more planning is always better. Planning is really about saving time by making decisions up-front that will help you avoid rework for mistakes you would make if you tried to implement the project blind, but the more decisions you try to make up front the longer the planning will take -- at a certain point it's faster to start doing the work and making the mistakes rather than to attempting to figure everything out to the n-th degree ahead of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347762/#Comment_347762" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T12:16:30+00:00" title="November  3, 2011 12:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>NO<br/>- Being in doubt if you really want to make a game</blockquote>\nThat one strikes a strange chord with me this week.

Care to elaborate on "right level of granularity"?<br/>It's a bit of an art. You generally want the tasks to be in roughly the same order of magnitude with each other so that it won't seem silly to have them on the same list. You want them to be big enough that you'll feel a genuine sense of accomplishment when you can mark them completed (important for building momentum), and big enough that it's not a bookkeeping nightmare to keep track of all the tasks on the project, but not so big that the amount of work you can accomplish in a single focused effort (e.g. what you're capable of doing in a single workday, assuming no external disruptions) seems insignificant compared to the size of the task. Being able to easily describe the size of the tasks in terms of how many of those blocks of effort they're expected to take (e.g. how many work days) can also help with schedule tracking, if that's important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
