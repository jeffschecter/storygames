Dave Cleaver and I recently finished a game of Jonathan Walton's "KazeKami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan".  The thread of the actual game is <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=14&amp;page=1#Item_44" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>What I found really interesting about the game was how quickly it reset my expectations about what I was getting out of it.  As the Kahn, I had no ability to actually stop Kyoko.  Explicitly, she was able to deal with whatever I threw at her, and the Khan was going to die.  What this meant was that, in play, the focus shifted from trying to come up with things that would stop Kyoko (my first few posts were like this), to creating challenges that would expose more of the world and the characters.  I really enjoyed setting up great opportunities for Kyoko to really shine, while revealing more about the Khan and his life.  <br/><br/>I've played a couple of play-by-post games like this, where there are really no rules for conflict resolution, and conflict becomes a pretty secondary part of the game.  In play, the analogy that comes to mind is volleyball, where the players are setting up the ball for each other.  One player will float the ball gently in front of the net, for the other player to spike.  KKKKK gives great opportunities for this kind of play by enforcing the use of questions in the Khan's ritual phrase.  Because I'm always asking questions, Kyoko alwas has an "in", an answer to provide.<br/><br/>While I'm on the subject, Ritual Phrases! These are so cool! I think they really went a long way towards establishing tone for the game, and formalising the "gameplay" aspect.  Each post felt like a concrete "move" in the game, like sliding forward a chess piece or playing a card.  The joy of the game was in making a move, and then anticipating the other player's response.  <br/><br/>There were a few times that I felt like Dave and I weren't quite on the same page in terms of the tone of the game.  I think I was angling for a slightly darker, more serious game, and his replies often seemed to brush off those untertones in favour of lighter material.  That said, I think we came together really well for the end of the game.  One thing I'd tried to do was create a sense of building tension, using repetition as a device, introducing successively more powerful wives, and then reversing the trend with the last wife being physically weak, but sincerely devoted to the Khan.  I really liked how Dave dealt with that, taking the opportunity to move the game from the realm of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> Kyoko kills the Khan, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span> she does so.  This was where I really wanted the game to go as well.  It felt like a game that only explored the physical abilities of Kyoko could only end unsatisfyingly, with a conformation that yes, indeed, Kyoko is both a wind spirit and a ninja, and thus unstoppable.  Instead, what we revealed about the relationship between the Khan and Kyoko really felt like a story. <br/><br/>I'd love to play the game again as Kyoko, to see how that changes my experience, and I'd love to hear from Dave about his experience of the game.  I felt like I was really exploring the GM role in the game, as a guide to take the story in interesting directions, while the main character always wins.  I wonder what it's like playing Kyoko.<br/><br/>I thought that occurred to me after looking at the depth of history we'd created through the game was that KKKKK would make an amazing tool for world creation.  I'd love to play a more traditional RPG in a world that had a previous game of KKKKKK as a historical document, myth, or prophesy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100346/#Comment_100346" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T20:39:21+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not played the game.

(Cryptic but accurate.) And your Netrunner allusion is informative because the two players (a) are in direct opposition, and (b) represent different <i>types</i> of entities.<br/><br/>But, going further, I could see a fantasy game on the order of D&amp;D, where each character class had totally different sets of rules. Example, character "death": The fighter does one thing (e.g., dies when he runs out of hit points), and the cleric does something else (e.g., retires when his faith falters).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100401/#Comment_100401" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T06:34:08+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  6:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Or one class makes attacks with piles of coins from a resource pool only, while another class makes attacks by rolling dice. Just sort of "whaaaaa?" stuff like that. That idea is the New Hotness, but it's sitting out there on the volcanic caldera, waiting to cool so that others can handle it and do something with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100419/#Comment_100419" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T08:19:21+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  8:19AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 7:15AM by J_Walton.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave (er... I mean Simon!), I really enjoyed watching you two play the game.  Thanks so much!  I think it also showed me the kind of game advice that needs to be in the text when I revise it, things like "Showing off Kyoko's superpowers may not make for the most entertaining game in the long run."<br/><br/>The volleyball "set-spike" metaphor is exactly what I was thinking about when I wrote the game, so Im glad that showed up for you as well.<br/><br/>Having played <i>Kazekami Kyoko</i>, I'm really excited to see what you think of <i>Waiting/Tea</i>, which is like the AD&amp;D version of <i>Kazekami</i>, in that the rules are more complex but still follow the "players play by different rules" approach.<br/><br/>Justin, it's funny that you were thinking about this kind of thing for one of your personal design projects, because I've been leaning in this direction with the <i>Fingers on the Firmament</i> project that we're doing, with different players playing by different rules according to their role in the party.  I'd be really excited to see if we can make that work.  That would be another step along this road, even more sophisticated than <i>Waiting/Tea</i>.<br/><br/>My inspirations for this kind of thing were really <i>Polaris</i>, though the rotating player roles diminish the impact of having different players play by different rules, and Ian Millington's articles on pushing a play group towards more collaborative play.  Millington's approach is not the "everybody GMs" that tends to feature in most post-Forge GM-less games, but is very much about dividing traditional GM responsibilities among various players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100433/#Comment_100433" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T09:48:02+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  9:48AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 5:44PM by Valvorik.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, I've been looking for the KKKK rules since reading <i>Waiting/Tea</i> in Push.

I see that as a magnification to extremes of what is true about many games once the novelty of a particular imagined reality wears off (swing at the ogre, the ogre swings at you) ~ not sure if that was the intent.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101513/#Comment_101513" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T08:12:46+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  8:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been fascinated by this game since I was first introduced to it.

I didn't want to not divulge details, but I got tired of having <i>Indeed</i> at the beginning of almost every statement. Also there is mention in the rules that Kyoko or the Khan could start new narratives at any time, but I felt like I would be brushing off the Khan's last response if I did, so I never used it.<br/><br/>There were moments in the game where I remember thinking "Oh crap.

I think part of what makes KKKKK so interesting is that because play is so absolutely boiled-down, you can really see a lot of these behaviours more clearly -- stuff that could easily be overlooked in a game that was more complicated in terms of narrative OR in terms of mechanics. The simplicity and focus of the game makes it much easier to pay attention to these sort of ubiquitous, implicit social systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101614/#Comment_101614" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T04:41:25+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  4:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fair.
