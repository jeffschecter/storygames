Vincent\u2019s Otherkind dice and In A Wicked Age have been inspirational as well. I\u2019ve always wanted to try my hand at making an RPG, but it seemed like a huge process best left to the professionals. After seeing these oracle games, I realised it was possible to go from concept to completed game in a weekend, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.<br/><br/>The result is my first roleplaying game: ZILLA!<br/><br/>You play as a giant zilla (a.k.a. any giant monster you can imagine) on a city-smashing rampage. Zillas are powerful and hard to kill, but they are prone to becoming enamoured with humans. Will you fight another zilla, escape the city to a better place, smash the city to the ground, or even... find love?<br/><br/>I\u2019m not a rabid monster movie fan or anything, but I realised this was a cool niche and worked well with quick play and one-shot games. Smashing a city seemed fun, but when I added the 'likely to fall in love with a human' aspect, this idea really took off. I think the resolution mechanic allows for enough successes and failures to make things interesting in the one or two hours you\u2019ll probably be playing for. I\u2019ve play tested this with a single player and a group of four. The stories that resulted ranged from funny to tragic (sometimes both) and we all had a lot of fun with the game.<br/><br/>I\u2019m hosting the PDF at my website, so you can download it here: <a href="http://www.pyresofvam.com/downloads/zilla_100619.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyresofvam.com/downloads/zilla_100619.pdf</a><br/><br/>If anyone reads or plays it, I\u2019d love to hear what you think of it.

However, I'm not sure the Wildlings 'choose an adjective(s)' really works for zilla. What I was thinking of was more Apocalypse World style moves - one for each of the main things a zilla does (kidnap, crush [people &amp; buildings], spawn, fight [other zilla]). I think that might better reflect the collateral damage of a zilla if the player is always choosing what unintended side-effects result from the zilla's clumsy enormity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276878/#Comment_276878" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T03:11:48+00:00" title="June 19, 2010  3:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love it, especially the way conflict between players are resolved by choosing more copies of a single adjective. What I'd like to see is a way of personalising your monster within the existing game rules: I have an issue with games that let you 'play anything you like' by making it irrelevant to the game mechanics. Could players maybe  scratch one option off the list, so that their monster <i>never</i> does that and then pick another one to be their monster's strength, say by giving them 3 tokens to spend on that result at any time in the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard" title="Mockingbard"><img alt="Mockingbard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.pyresofvam.com/wp-content/themes/piano-black/img/fire32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard">Mockingbard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276906/#Comment_276906" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T18:58:48+00:00" title="June 19, 2010  6:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the kind words and suggestions, guys :) Glad you both like it.<br>\n<br>\nChris, I haven\u2019t read Apocalypse World, but people have been saying good things about it around here. I\u2019ll be sure to order a copy as soon as it\u2019s available \u2013 which, judging from Vincent\u2019s website should be very soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do like the idea of players choosing the collateral damage they inflict. Could you give me a bit more info about how the moves work? From what you\u2019re saying I think you mean that players choose consequences on failed rolls? How are the consequences decided?<br/>\n<br/>\nJames, I like your idea about personalising the monsters and I really like the way you suggested implementing it. I\u2019ll definitely have a think about that one. In our playtests it was the weaknesses and special powers that made the monsters different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had one that was just a massive blob of goo with a vulnerable nucleus inside. It couldn\u2019t smash things or run or even climb very well, but it could do something the others couldn\u2019t: \u2018engulf\u2019, which allowed it to roll over and consume most things in its path. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had a plant monster that had a seedling attack \u2013 it could hurl seedlings at an area and small versions of the zilla would root themselves to that position and thrash about, attacking anything in the area. Of course, the plant monster was vulnerable to fire, which complicated some things for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, these two zillas \u2013 while having the same outcomes to choose from \u2013 played very differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the idea of completely scratching one of the outcomes is great! I could see a very large zilla not being able to do anything Quickly, but having the ability to add Forcefully to some other rolls. You could maybe even link outcomes to special powers. So, you can\u2019t \u2018smash\u2019 Quickly, but you could spend a token to make any \u2018smash\u2019 roll Forceful. Your \u2018laser beams\u2019 are always Careful (as in, precise) or Quick, but never Thorough... or something like that. I\u2019ll ponder the possible ways this could work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone\u2019s interested, I thought I might write up the single player AP and the group AP from playtesting to give an idea of how things work. I\u2019ll see if I get a chance to do that this week.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276933/#Comment_276933" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T07:43:32+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  7:43AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 7:47AM by Sanglorian.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mockingbard</cite>Chris, I haven\u2019t read Apocalypse World, but people have been saying good things about it around here.
