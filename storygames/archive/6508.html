I'm very good at adjusting my perspective once a person details where they're coming from but I need those details otherwise I default to my rather particular world view.  <br/><br/>This thread is largely aimed at me trying to understand why Mike Holmes is unsatisfied with what we have for thematic-competative hybrid.  I think my lack of understanding is tied up in what I mean when I say competitive and thematic.<br/><br/>Let's start with thematic.  Theme, to me, is not something any single player DOES.  Theme is something that RESULTS from the intersection of player actions and the unpredictable spin the rules when those actions and rules are charged with Premise.  Theme is created from play and articulated in hindsight, not MADE to happen by anyone. (Note: if it IS made to happen by anyone then that's something else, perhaps not relevant to this discussion).<br/><br/>Competition, on the other hand, is about social status among the real players.  "I play this game better than you." (This includes the notion of a cooperative party of players trying to beat the GM's adventure). This, to me, is not the same as rules mastery or playing hard for character success.  Sorcerer, in my opinion, requires both rules mastery and driving hard for character success to function as intended.  However, it is not competitive because you are not trying to master the rules better than anyone else.<br/><br/>Now because Theme, to me, is a RESULT it's entirely possible to be playing an entirely competitive game and end up with a thematically charged story.  The game only becomes Story Now/Narrativism when the player's actions deliberately address Premise rather than doing so as a side effect of their competition.<br/><br/>So, first question to Mike Holmes: Do you mean what I mean given the above?<br/><br/>Now launching from this point let's talk about Mike's example from his original thread about going to run by the side of a fallen comrade mid-battle.  I'm sort of going to use Sorcerer's rules but I'm not going to break it out round by round.  I can if I need to but that's a lot of work.<br/><br/>So, let's say Arthur is in the middle of a duel with his rival Bradley on a raging battlefield.  At the end of the last round Arthur's best friend Conrad is cut down.  The GM calls for actions.<br/><br/>Arthur: "I rush to Conrad's side!"  Rolls Stamina.<br/>Bradley: "I attack Arthur with a swift slice of my sword."  Rolls Stamina<br/>GM: "I like the idea of the battlefield being a factor in this.  The battle itself is trying to cut Arthur down as he runs to Conrad."  Rolls three dice.<br/><br/>Now given my knowledge of Sorcerer rules here's the full range of outcomes.<br/><br/>Arthur is cut down and dies crawling arms out towards his fallen comrade.<br/>^<br/>|<br/>| --&gt; Lots of really subtle other outcomes in here.<br/>|<br/>v<br/>As Arthur is cradling his fallen comrade he whips out his sword and whirls to block the incoming blow of Bradley's sword, renewed hate in his eyes.<br/><br/>Here are the two key points of the example as I see them.<br/><br/>1) Notice the vast thematic gulf that exists between the two extreme possible outcomes.  This is what I mean when I say that theme is a RESULT and not MADE.  In Sorcerer there is nothing Arthur can do to MAKE any of these outcomes happen.  He has mechanical choices to make that will INFLUENCE which of these outcomes happen but he can't ever guarantee it.  That's why I love Sorcerer.<br/><br/>2) The degree of mechanical risk in Arthur's announced action is no more and no less than any other action he could have announced.  He could have flat out attacked Bradley and the mechanical dice manipulations and odds would have been about the same.  The only difference is what is on the line in terms of the range of fictional outcomes.  Again this is a feature of Sorcerer I really like.  You can announce any action AND play the rules well.<br/><br/>So second question to Mike: Why doesn't this work for you?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144297/#Comment_144297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T16:30:18+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  4:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I can butt in for a moment, I'd like to posit that competition DNE Step On Up.

That's that whole "unit of play" thing.  Just because we're competing right now, doesn't mean our game as a whole is competitive.  <br/><br/>Capes is another example that uses competition as a support beam for Story Now.  Largely because when people focus on acquiring the game resources as the point of play the SIS tends to suffer and it becomes HARDER to acquire those resources.  Only when the Conflicts have fictional emotional value to players does the competition become functional.<br/><br/>So, yes, to be super strict.  Competition is a Technique.  Competition as the focus of play is Step On Up.<br/><br/>Which is why I believe what Mike wants is (a) possible and (b) already exists.  I picked Sorcerer in my initial example because I know it best.  Capes is probably a BETTER example but I'm trying to sus out what *Mike* means by "thematic decisions" and "competition."  Because I suspect he means something rather specific that I'm not seeing and might very well NOT exist.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144315/#Comment_144315" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:29:57+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After thinking about it a little more I want to focus less on the "competition" part and more on the "thematic" part.  In the other thread Mike was pretty clear that he means "sound tactical play" for competition.  I'm good with that.  I think my confusion lies in what he means by "thematic decision."<br/><br/>So here's my third question to Mike: Are you bothered by the existence of the thematic gulf I point out in my example?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144415/#Comment_144415" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T09:39:55+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  9:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you can't see me nodding my head in acknowledgement, I thought I'd let you know that I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
