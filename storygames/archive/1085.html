<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jasper</cite>What do you think the effective difference between escalating and non-escalating (flat?) are? Is escalating always more interesting, or can the finality of a flat bid/trade have its own purpose?</blockquote>
Jasper asked this of most everybody (so join in) and I thought it probably deserved its own thread.<br/><br/>To me, I think escalating stakes is an improvement over flat stakes, but that's not exactly saying much.  Escalating stakes certainly avoids the grind-a-thon nature that defined most of my prior gaming, where every session was pretty much the same as the last, just with different window dressing.  However, I find purely escalating stakes to be more than a little exhausting, and only appropriate in short-run to medium-run games.  Dogs being a prime example, I can't even conceive of going for more than three or four towns (and the dice system starts to break down after six or so).<br/><br/>I think the optimal stakes frequency, if you will, is something more like a sine wave.  You need some ramping up to conflicts and whatnot, but you also need some settling down time that allows the players and characters to wind down, reflect, and maybe pursue kinds of character development that is only available in a less-pressured setting.  We have two approximations to the sine wave -- the flat line (non-escalating stakes) and the straight positive-slope line (escalating stakes).  The flat line approximates best over a long period of time and the positive-slope line approximates best in the short-term, but the flat line doesn't have the variation needed to maintain interest and the positive-slope line never lets up to give the characters and players time to unwind, relax, reflect, or develop outside of always-pounding conflict.<br/><br/>I think we'll see some new developments on the horizon for manipulating stakes in a fashion more amenable to long-term play.  I think PTA probably stands out here as a good precursor.  The television-series motif allows players to access mostly unconscious understanding of the ebb and flow of plot significance because they base it off of their long experience with television shows.  All we need to do now is figure out how to bottle it and start injecting it into our game designs.                </div>

                            Aaron asked a good question:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stack0v3rflow</cite>By escalating stakes do you mean the outcome of the conflict resolution or the resources used to get them (or consequences)?</blockquote>
At first I thought I meant "both" but on reflection (and post-edit) I mean only the stakes that you win or lose via the system, <em>not</em> the resources used to win those stakes and not the dire consequences that might occur if you lose.  A lot of "traditional gaming" (by which I mean D&amp;D and everything that tried to be D&amp;D) involved playing very similar stakes with ever-increasing resources and consequences:<br/><br/><strong>Non-Escalating Stakes, Escalating Resources, Escalating Consequences</strong><br/>1) Rescue a little girl kidnapped by kobolds or they'll eat her!<br/>2) Find a locket stolen by goblins and hidden in a series of crypts so that the town will be safe!<br/>3) Defeat a necromancer at the bottom of a dungeon and retreive his magic doohickey to save the kingdom!<br/>4) Kill the Evil God to forestall apocalypse!<br/><br/>The stakes -- survive and get a mcguffin -- don't really change, but the increasing power of the main characters and adversaries (and the consequent destruction weilded by the adversaries) change the experience.  When done well, this creates a pretty entertaining campaign.  When done poorly, this creates Power Creep.<br/><br/>However, right about now I'm not sure if I'm on the right track or just blowing hot air.  I'm pondering.  What do you folks think?                        </div>

                            I'm thinking the long-term repercussions of lack of player character intervention.  What will happen to the town if the Dogs don't show up?  That sort of thing.  Because you don't usually find "Save the Kingdom" as the declared stakes in any particular die roll; the kingdom being saved is a repercussion of, say, "Kill the Necromancer and take his doohickey".                        </div>

                            So in your D&amp;D example, the stakes are always "Do we beat this guy and take his stuff?", but the consequences of beating the guy and taking the stuff vary.<br/><br/>Whereas in Dogs, say, the stakes can vary widely and are expressed in terms of impact on the <i>characters</i>, rather than impact on the <i>situation</i>, which is what you are referring to as consequences.<br/><br/>Do I have that right?                        </div>

                            Hm. I'm confused. Joshua, it seems like you're talking about progression/escalation of tension over the long-term course of play. But wasn't Mike's post about escalation within a single conflict? Are you viewing these two kinds of escalation as essentially the same, or have I misread someone?                        </div>

                            Mike -- yes.<br/><br/>Jasper -- they are essentially the same to my eye, just easier to illustrate in the macroscopic scale.  Girl Eaten/Town Burned/Kingdom Falls is easier to lay out than Lose Advantage/Lose Hit Points/Knocked Out of Fight.<br/><br/>So while it's nice to have that episode in the middle of the season that doesn't push the season metaplot, but just lets the principal characters be who they are and do something that's not fucking earth-shattering for a change (the macroscopic), it's also nice to have big significant fight scenes followed by in-character conversation and a little humor (the mezzoscopic), and even after downing the first badguy in a long-form combat to chase the second badguy across the combat map before downing him (the microscopic).  Every stage of the game should not be "like what we just did, except <strong>more</strong>."<br/><br/>Or a different example from a different angle: you're the GM, right, and the PCs have hacked their way into the dungeon and just killed a Level 10 Hobgoblin.  If the next encounter is a Level 11 Hobgoblin, and the encounter after that is a Level 12 Hobgoblin, and then the Level 13 Hobgoblin... you get what I mean?  Exclusive escalation eventually dulls the benefit that escalation is supposed to provide you in the first place.<br/><br/><em>Disclaimer:</em> While I might sound like I'm all certain about this stuff, I'm totally unsure of half of what I'm saying.  I'm groping around for the lightswitch.                        </div>

                            How about With Great Power. . . for that sine wave?  Enrichment scenes alternate with conflict scenes, and the conflict scenes necessarily build up to a make-or-break conflict with the villain.                        </div>

                            Pacing has a big impact on these models you're describing. A sharp upward slope can be made into a gentle hill if the rising stakes are separated. For example; kill Level 11 Hobgoblin, go to town and rest. Kill Level 12 Hobgoblin, go to town and rest. The intensity of rising stakes is dulled.                        </div>

I went to a play-writing class where the teacher plotted "Tension" against "Story Time". The ideal graph, she suggested, was approximately a sine wave: tension goes up, then goes down to let the audience rest, then goes up again, then down, etc.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that your sine wave applies in other types of storytelling as well. And, by extension, the sine wave doesn't just let your players and characters wind down: it's a function of telling a good story.<br/><br/>Incidentally, her graph went up over time. So, at the start of the story, it went up a bit, and then came back down. Then it went up a bit more, then came back down, but didn't quite hit zero. And so on until, at the climax, the tension shot right up and then crashed down.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Marhault, I haven't seen WGP because I am a bad person.  What happens after the villain is toasted?<br/><br/>Russel, I agree in principle, but it also really depends on how much of "go to town to rest" you're actually playing.  If you spend half an hour killing the Level 10 Hobgoblin, then say "then you go to town and rest" and go right back into a half-hour combat with Hobgoblin 11, there's very little rest for the players, even if the characters are theoretically "rested."<br/><br/>Graham, oh yeah, this is actually very similar to classical three-act and five-act play structures.  And if you're going for a campaign of such a duration, all of what you've said is perfectly on-target.  For campaigns that extend beyond one plotline -- the classic years-long campaign -- I suspect even that upward trend must be reigned in occasionally.  Otherwise you get the problem you see occasionally on television serials where each season introduces an increasingly improbable big bad and the series drifts away from its core premise (Buffy, Stargate).  You've got to bring the characters back to a "real" conflict with individual people that they care about or else the characters lose any anchor the normalcy they had and become increasingly difficult for an audience to sympathize with.                        </div>

                            Trollbabe handles this by the concept of "scale" - you start out with conflicts/stakes that affect one or a few individuals and, between sessions, by player request, increase the scale (small group, town, country, world, from memory, but probably incorrect memory). But it's a specific rule that the scale only ever goes up, not down. The consequence, I imagine, is that once you've had a world-scale conflict, you stop - those particular characters, that particular story, are at their natural end.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think your suggestion (scale it back occasionally, reduce the consequences) is a better way to go.                        </div>

I think this may be pretty key to what I've been groping at in terms of escalating and not escalating things in play.  The escalation-ramp is for the crunch and hitting what's important.  The de-escalation-ramp is for reflecting, modifying, and prepping characters for later escalation.<br/><br/>Must think on this...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Trollbabe handles this by the concept of "scale" - you start out with conflicts/stakes that affect one or a few individuals and, between sessions, by player request, increase the scale (small group, town, country, world, from memory, but probably incorrect memory). But it's a specific rule that the scale only ever goes up, not down. The consequence, I imagine, is that once you've had a world-scale conflict, you stop - those particular characters, that particular story, are at their natural end.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think your suggestion (scale it back occasionally, reduce the consequences) is a better way to go.</blockquote>
I don't want to come off as a kneejerk Trollbabe defender, but the Scale mechanic in Trollbabe is set up like it is (you can, but are not required to, raise the Scale - you can never lower it) for a very specific reason.  In the context of the entire game, allowing you to scale things down would weaken the design.<br/><br/>But the point is that the escalation is set up this way for a reason.  A game that had different concerns/goals/etc. very well might be better off with some other kind of escalation mechanic.                        </div>

                            Joshua, check out With Great Power. . . the first chance you get.  The game is all about story structure as it applies to melodramatic superhero stories.  It's the only game I can think of that's deliberately built to use the rise and fall of action in the way that you describe.  There's a built in time limit to the game, sooner or later, the heroes will either defeat the villain, or lose to him.  Everything before that conflict rolls into it.  After the final conflict is wrapped and the fallout therefrom dealt with, the rules suggest a final enrichment scene, and then you do the letters column (where you talk about the game you just played), then the game is over.                        </div>
