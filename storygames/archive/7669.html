We were playing at the September meeting of WARGS, the Wellington RPG group.<br/><br/>Paul, our GM, had done some work to "Dresdenize" Wellington, and this worked really well for us.  Wellington's a very compact city, and so we were all familiar with the locations used in the game.  This helped a lot with visualizing scenes, and often suggested scene Aspects, NPCs, and so on.  Later that day, I walked past a spot on the waterfront where "in game" we'd discovered a dismembered body.  It was an interesting experience of seeing the same spot through different eyes.<br/><br/>Paul tends to run very "collaborative" games, making things up on the spot, and letting players determine the results of their successes.  While I generally really like this kind of play, I'm not sure it's the best fit for the Dresden Files rules, nor for the kind of investigative game we ended up playing.  A lot of the time it felt like "Roll until you succeed" - we were going to get the information one way or another - either we'd get Sanjeef the storeowner to talk, or we'd blow the roll, and we'd find out some other way.  It felt like the system wasn't quite supporting what we wanted to do.  It certainly wasn't hindering us.  I guess we ran into what you could call the "Call of Cthulhu" problem: Either you have a game where a failed roll can derail the game entirely, or you have a game where you can't fail.  I certainly felt like we couldn't fail in our game, and that the dice were just shaping the way in which we succeeded.  I think that's a fine way to run a game, but I felt like the rules, since they weren't determining success or failure, weren't doing a heck of a lot else, either.  I think a lot of these problems would be mitigated by a more deterministic approach to GMing, and a group that was more invested in the long-term outcomes of their actions.<br/><br/>I have to commend Paul for a fine job GMing for a difficult group, however.  We were all relative strangers, and one player was very reticent.  Paul did an excellent job of encouraging that player to get more involved, and to bring his character into a more central role in the fiction.  Paul was also really good about communicating his intentions as GM, telling us what was working, what wasn't, and what we could all try to make it work better.<br/><br/>On the whole, I had a pretty good time in the game.  I enjoyed the "Urban Fantasy" genre, and even though I'm not familiar with the source material, I enjoyed imagining this alternative, spooky Wellington.  I'd really like to see what the system, and the setting, could do, given a more dedicated group, with the time to really explore the setting.  I think that's where the game will really shine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170433/#Comment_170433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T21:19:51+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  9:19PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi ya<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul the gm of this game here<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was  great game, I had lots of fun running the game, as Simon said it was a fun game but there were issues with running it, it was the first time i have really run for  this system so I was learning a lot as I was running.<br/>\n<br/>\nafter a false start at our original venue and traveling to the new one I was feeling forced with time so the game was a little rushed, and with neither me or the players being skilled with the system we could have had the game work a better. I really want to show that it may not be the system at fault and more my style with running the game that made it feel forced,game also failed from me not having lots of time to prepare.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to reiterate, I had a great time, I had some neat players , we made a cool story and the outcome was a fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
