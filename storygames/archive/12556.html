My particular incarnation of it is the 2E DMG, but I suspect 1E has a lot of the same flaws. It's antagonistic and adversarial and is all about not letting players get what they want. Potentially it may have been in response to problematic players, but the origin of it is less important than the fact that I really think I became a better GM when I did the exact opposite of what it advised, and that if you keep withholding something from someone they want it more. Now there's the thought with that that D&amp;D created jerky players (I certainly know it made me more jerky than I needed to be, and it took a good time off to fix that), but it may not be true across the board. There's also the thought that maybe it attracts jerky players, or some other factors in there possibly making it random coincidence.<br/><br/>Here's where I get to the question part - do people who play a wide variety of games, say including CCGs, tabletop wargames, traditional RPGs and story games - do different types of people show up for different games, and do more unpleasant people show up for certain ones? I don't have much to draw from with tabletop games, but in the computer field, purely anecdotal, it seems that people who like JRPGs are usually pretty nice people I don't have any complaints about, and people who hate JRPGs and complain about them usually have at least a few negative geek stereotype qualities. On the flip side, people who don't like online FPS games are generally just those who don't like getting trash talked and insulted at every turn, while those who do like them are either the ones doing the trash talking or at least have a callous and can give back what they take.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281929/#Comment_281929" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T14:23:40+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  2:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the general wisdom around here goes something like this:<br/><br/>No set of rules can *solve* social problems with a game or an individual in a game.

It's very contextual.<br/><br/>For a short while a few years back I played with a group that was very into the whole trash-talk, competitive, in-your-face optimization/ass-kicking/powergaming thing. It wasn't the actual content of the gameplay that was a problem for us - I enjoy that sort of thing in some forms. No, it was the culture of (highly gendered) interpersonal aggression at the table. I think if anyone was the "jerk" at that table, it was me. These guys had a viable group, and I came into it with my teamwork-focused, highly abstract approach to the same kind of play and totally broke the vibe. They were barroom, I was boardroom.<br/><br/>But for whatever value of "Jerk" you care to name, some kinds of games will facilitate (and thus attract), hamper (and thus drive away or drive covert), or ignore (and thus <b>not discourage</b>) certain kinds of behavior.<br/><br/>I like best games that call out very specifically what their behavioral assumptions are, and fail quickly if those assumptions aren't valid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281948/#Comment_281948" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T15:17:23+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  3:17PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At conventions even though I don't like the Call of Cthulhu game system, I will often sign up for CoC events because my experience is they attract engaging, nice, and enthusiastic people. <br/><br/>I don't avoid D&amp;D games because they attract people that don't mesh well with my play style.

For example, I've never seen more emotionally abusive relationships between players than in the many LARP and IRC World of Darkness (WoD) games I've been in. Non-WoD LARPs don't seem to exhibit this problem, nor does tabletop WoD. Magic the Gathering has many friendly players, but the ones that engage in tournament play can be an obnoxious crowd. There seems to have to be a combination of elements to draw out the jerks.<br/><br/>On a side note, as a bookstore employee I know we stopped carrying roleplaying books because they were stolen more than anything else in the store, and that the same is often true for roleplaying books in libraries. This seems to be specific to roleplaying books, though, because the same people are voracious consumers of other books, and generally a bit easier to deal with than the psychiatric hospital outpatients that are the bulk of our regular customers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281954/#Comment_281954" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T15:49:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  3:49PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed that about stealing.

It doesn't get stolen, nor do the scandal-of-the-day books (e.g. The Shack), so no, I don't think fundamentalists are behind it at all, at least not around here.<br/><br/>Back on topic: jerks seem to be attracted to games with bureaucratic structures behind them, be they tournaments or formalized gaming groups like the Camarilla. These bureacratic structures then get used like armour, keeping the jerk in the group. Eventually, the jerks drive away the more pleasant people and become the core of the group.<br/><br/>The importance of insider knowledge (such as in-game slang or using first-person language when referrring to characters) to an activity doesn't necessarily attract jerks, but can create a social barrier between gamers and non-gamers. Furthermore, outsiders might see such gamers as jerks because they can't find a way to cross from outsider to insider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282147/#Comment_282147" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T11:49:27+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 11:49AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html" rel="nofollow">Geek Social Fallacies</a> seem relevant to this discussion, especially the part about using formalized social structures as 'armor'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282150/#Comment_282150" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T12:04:36+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 12:04PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2010 12:08PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theft: Consider the combination audience and necessity of reference text.

Functional rules of thumb for social interaction might look somewhat like the GSF, but would (very importantly) have 'exit clauses' coded in them for special cases. Ultimately if you interact with people you will be in a position where you might or might not judge their behavior; the GSF try to remove this judgement entirely, and that's one of the reasons that actually following their principles doesn't lead to functional social interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282201/#Comment_282201" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T14:31:22+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  2:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Where's the jerk that calls himself 'The Tick'?"<br/><br/>"<b>I</b> am that jerk."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282264/#Comment_282264" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T20:25:20+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  8:25PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Norris</cite>the GSF try to remove this judgement entirely, and that's one of the reasons that actually following their principles doesn't lead to functional social interaction.</blockquote>\nInteresting how that sounds like rules lawyering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
