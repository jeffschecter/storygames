I really enjoyed it and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m looking forward to more adventures in the Blue City.  Upon buying the book, I was a little annoyed to find that the rules are divided into color-coded sections, some of which are off limits to players!  What the\xe2\u20ac\xa6?!  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve paid for this book!  But in play, it worked out pretty neatly, in that since we didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know much about the setting as players, our characters didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know either.  Three highlights:  stumbling through the setting, figuring out what was what and who was who.  This was necessary because the GM started us on our characters\xe2\u20ac\u2122 first mission with some kind of insertion error that resulted in significant memory loss.  The heart-rate mechanic as a measure of health is very fine.  It seems a perfect mechanism for the setting, and helps reflect rising tension as the characters do more and get closer to some sort of resolution in a mission.  And the ability, through skills such as Access, to introduce elements into the setting.  I felt a lot of empowerment to influence the direction of the story, so long as my heart could take it.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve posted an audio excerpt of the game at <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a>.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try to get the complete game posted soon.<br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95260/#Comment_95260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T15:45:05+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Upon buying the book, I was a little annoyed to find that the rules are divided into color-coded sections, some of which are off limits to players!

So it's one of the few games that could get away with what it does.<br/><br/>(I also call it the Aristocrats joke for GMs -- no GM will run it the same way, and playing Lacuna with a GM gives you an idea of how that GM works.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95329/#Comment_95329" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T21:44:26+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's quite the opposite.
