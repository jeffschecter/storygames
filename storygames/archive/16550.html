We got some of he highlights on video and thought some of the footage might be of interest to folks here.<br/><br/>There's four clips in all, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa12OVuAzNc" rel="nofollow">this link is to the first one.</a>.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear feedback, I really want to try and do more of this sort of discussion at my store(s), and knowing what worked and didn't and will help us make futur presentations equally interesting and engaging.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Jim C.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
