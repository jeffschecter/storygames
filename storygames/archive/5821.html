Right now, those are:\n<blockquote>Nationality<br/>You may be American, British, French, German, Swiss, or Italian.<br/>American girls get some benefit when attempting rash, bold, or dangerous things<br/>British girls get some benefit in withstanding hardship or enduring duress<br/>French girls get some benefit in dissembling and social exchanges<br/>German girls get some benefit in physical exertion and weathering illness<br/>Swiss girls get some benefit in making and using mechanical equipment<br/>Italian girls get some benefit in languages and history<br/>This benefit shall be one additional mark in the appropriate circumstances</blockquote>\nWhat sorts of things could I add for Martian YLQs ( Hill, Canal, High, etc)?<br/><br/>What about girls of other nationalities or culture groups/backgrounds?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130374/#Comment_130374" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T20:11:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:11PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an excellent idea!<br/><br/>Canal Martian ladies might get a benefit when engaged in art or in cultural discourse (due to the stagnant, introverted and involved nature of their civilization).<br/>Hill Martian ladies might get a benefit when enduring privation (particularly thirst) or when handling animals (since most hill clans are nomads and live closely with one breed or other of Martian animal).<br/>There are no 'Ladies' among the High Martians, 'of Quality' or otherwise!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>...<br/>OK, if you insist, and merely for completeness; how about High Martian 'ladies' getting a benefit when using their claws to fight and when eating meat raw.  ::Gulp!::<br/><br/>Belgians and Japanese are nationalities featured prominently in the 1889 setting.  I'll have to think a bit to come up with suggestions for appropriate 'cultural stereotypes' for them.  You might include Venusian lizard-ladies of quality; but that's almost as far afield as High Martian ones...<br/><br/>Good luck with this, it sounds like it will be a blast!<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130384/#Comment_130384" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T21:02:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  9:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you like it! I admit, I'm currently doing a horrible disservice to the games tha are inspiring this, by crash building an uber-light system to use with it, rather than either of the native systems.<br/><br/>[To put this idea into context, I'm going to the local game con in a couple months and taking my 11 yera old daughter. Last year, she ended up in the kids room, playing what turned into an all-girls game of The Princes' Kingdom. I wanted to do something that would be fun, I'd enjoy running, and which would hopefully give Thren a chance to meet other gamer-girls around her age to hang out with over the weekend.]<br/><br/>As for the High Martians? Well, I admit, I found it a bit far-fetched, too. OTOH, maybe the sly WormPriests have convinced Hattabranx to send one of his many grand-daughters off as a spy. Time in the school would be perfect cover for learning more about the Red Men from Earth. And, if the grand-daughter happens to become too friendly, well, Hattabranx has many granchildren ( mwahahahahaha!). Sort of like Ming the Merciless' daughter crossed with a Slytherin student, I think.<br/><br/>I got nothin' for the lizard people, mostly because I'd been thinking of Mars, and it seems awfully dry for them. Maybe lizard folk have some different sort of gender ( maybe that's getting a wee bit Star Trek-y...)<br/><br/>Any thoughts on folks from the rest of Earth? Indians? Native Americans? CowGirls of Quality? <br/><br/>BTW- I think you really nailed the Martian types and I'll probably use those pretty much directly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
