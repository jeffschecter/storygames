                    Cross-posted from <a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org" rel="nofollow">mah blog:</a><br/><br/>Taking a few minutes away from the development of Ludolab, which now exists in a sort of raw form, I wanted to talk a bit about immersion.  I noticed that there was a fair amount of traffic on the subject a while back, and on Story Games, the topic continues to surface in various threads.
<p>Let’s take a second to define what we’re talking about.  Folks throw around Forgite terms, of course, but I prefer to work from sources outside gaming and work my way in.  And so, the <em>OED</em> has this to say about immersion (skipping the bits about baptism for a moment):<br/><br/></p><blockquote><p><em>immerse (v): </em><strong>2.</strong> <em>transf.</em> and <em>fig.</em> To plunge or sink into a (particular) state of body or mind; to involve deeply, to steep, absorb, in some action or activity. Chiefly <em>pass.</em> or <em>refl.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Since the players are the only autonomous entities in games, then we can assume that immersion involves the players.  But what are they ‘involved deeply’ in?</p>
Traditionally, immersion has meant a few different things: being immersed ‘in the game’, or being immersed in ‘your character’.  But these definitions are imprecise.  Let’s see if we can construct a better picture of immersion in the AGE Model.<br/><br/>In the ‘typical’ mode of gameplay, the players are equally conversant and involved with all four of the game spaces: the playspace (negotiating with or at least being cognizant of the influence of the other players), the empsace (the constructed reality of the game world), the gamespace (the rules of construction and interaction with the emspace and/or within the playspace), and the aspace (their personal aspirations and interpretations of the gameplay).<br/><br/>The idea of immersion would seem to indicate that immersive play does not follow this same pattern - that one space takes precedence over the others in the play of the immersed player.  Which space?  Well, all of them to some degree.<br/><br/>The Four Immersions:<br/><br/><em>e-immersion (emmersion?)</em>: Immersion of the player in the emspace.  Decisions are made mainly on the basis of the the player’s POV within the emspace - nominally this is the player’s character.  The player is engaged primarily in the negotiation of the emspace - whatever that entails.  In most RPGs, that would mean being ‘in character’, but certainly other forces that affect the emspace (diegetic or plotting concerns) wouldn’t be out of alignment.<br/><br/><em>p-immersion</em>: Immersion of the player in the playspace.  I’m not sure what the implications of this immersion are, frankly.  Perhaps deep forms of competitiveness or ‘zoning’ in team-game situations.<br/><br/><em>g-immersion</em>: Immersion of the player in the gamespace. The most direct example of this sort of play is in the ‘addiction’ of certain computer games (such as SimCity), where the rest of the world seems to melt away and the reality of the game is felt very keenly.  It’s differentiated from e-immersion in that there is no true emspace (only the aspace and the gamespace), and the player’s presence in the gamespace is diffused to the point where every part of the game is part of the player’s consciousness.<br/><br/><em>a-immersion</em>: Immersion of the player in the aspace.  Again, the most direct example that I can think of is in computer games, particularly evocative ones like <em>Rome: Total War</em>, where the play of the game suggests a metanarrative that the game is simply a crude reflection of.  The player moves into the metanarrative and sees the game through the lens of a wholly fabricated reality which only exists in their own mind.<br/><br/>To summarize: Immersion would (at least according to the AGE Model) appear to be a shift in priority and engagement on the part of the player to one or another of the spaces of the game.  This doesn’t necessarily mean that the other spaces aren’t present or that the player disregards their existence - simply that priority is given to the maintenance of the disequilibrium for their own enjoyment.  This is only dysfunctional if it makes engagement in the playspace untenable or unsustainable.                </div>

                            Hey dude, interesting.  I often feel that when I see one person flag-waving for "Immersion", and see another person waving the same flag, and then me waving the flag as well (because I like e/p immersion) that we're talking about different things...<br/><br/>The real question here, for Story Games, is "What next?"<br/><br/>That is, if we say, "OK, I like those definitions", what do they bring to the table? Other than new ways to classify individual/group interests for the whole Big Model thing?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: (ok, found a great pic just now in my collection). I'm interested in the practical aspects of this stuff, so that if nothing else someone doesn't just come along and say...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.robo-christ.com/gallery/streamimage.php?path=L3JhbmRvbSBhd2Vzb21lISEhLzExMjE1NTg4NjY3MTQuanBn"/><br/><br/>...oh yeah, I'm on a roll today.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Moved the pic frm Picassa to my site)                        </div>

                            Oooh--very cool, Kuma.  I have been mulling over immersion myself...I feel like we are on the tip of something big here, although I can't say exactly the tip of what.<br/><br/>I have been working Jung's typology hard lately (I think hard enough that I really don't want to quickly associate it with MBTI), and I see a lot of parallels with what you raised.  Parallel development--good sign!<br/><br/>Big things (and plenty, all perhaps, of this is just pointing my finger at what you already said): <br/>1. that immersion realy does happen in different and remarkably distinct ways<br/>2. that the word immersion crops up in relation to them all because those immersing in these different ways all feel their experience properly captured in the way they get *in* the game<br/>3. that you can get in the game differently but support each other's (different) getting in<br/><br/>And perhaps most important:<br/><br/>4. that each mode of getting in is defined by stable modes of getting in, that each have distinct objects that their mode organizes and respods to, as well as objects which they have a hard time organizing--that often seems confusing and jarring to an immersion.  It's like feeding someone a coded message without realizing they are using a different code.<br/><br/>Find the objects, define them, find ways to allow each person to interact with their objects in their preferred fashion...part of this may have to do with rhythm--giving each person a 'spotlight' immersion stretch, allowing them to 'rest' or 'get their breath' during someone else's immersion moment.  Identifying which modes of immersion can occur 'at the same time' and which require alternation.  A lot of this seems deeply practical--as in will vary in practice from person to person, but what about developing tools that can be carried off to those local, different practices?<br/><br/>PS--I only see a red X, too.                        </div>

                            Just to let folks know - I'm working on a response to this - I'm trying to figure out the forces involved with immersion, which will lead to the practical applications.                        </div>
