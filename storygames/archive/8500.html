That is, how we get to those points where everyone in the room is sort of golden, where we seem to share a vision of a different world, where we're throwing ideas and words into the air and catching them and spinning them.<br/><br/>It seems to me that to get there, we need a ritual. And I wonder if one of the things that keeps many of us in this hobby is that we are ritual-minded people. We somehow need the structure, the community, that we get from role-playing.<br/><br/>How does this fit in with, or compare to, other rituals? Do all people have the same need, desire, or potential for ritual action/interaction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188414/#Comment_188414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T00:43:04+00:00" title="January 15, 2009 12:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2009 12:44AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not much experience in this (or, rather, not much reflexions, as the following are things that came \u201cnaturally\u201d), but I find that clearly delimiting the start and the end of the game by ritual helps to have a good experience. This is ruined if you have unrespectful interference from the outside, as the game/notgame frontier gets blurred.<br/><br/>I've used ritual phrases (eg: Shadowrun: \u201cThe worlds has changed. Some say it has\u2026 awakened.\u201d at the start of the game, same at the end), theme music (eg: Shadowrun: Dawn Patrol by Megadeth) at game start and end or the whole game, candle lighting, light dimming (although I tend to rather use that in-game to indicate different moods/moments/ambiance expectations), incense, character presentation/descriptions.<br/><br/>There are somewhat automatic rituals in trad games : last session summary at the intro, experience and character advancement at the outtro.<br/><br/>I believe start-of-game and end-of-game rituals are more effective if everyone is an actor in them \u2014 for a few games, I asked the players to each say a distinctive quote or describe a distinctive attitude for their character to get a kind of credits effect; it worked rather well, I don't know why we stopped doing that \u2014 rather than a simple witness (of a game-leader act).

I mean it's hard to name any activity for which all people have the same need, desire, or potential, though, so maybe I am misunderstanding. As someone with (apparently) little interest or capacity for ritual, I am a bit skeptical about the connection between a 'need for ritual' and a desire to play roleplaying games, though. Of course if I accept that roleplaying games are rituals, then it might follow that I am wrong about my relation to ritual, and simply fail to recognize its varied appearance in my life. Another alternative is that I am right about my attitude towards all other rituals, but roleplaying is somehow exceptional. This makes sense to me if one assumes that one's capacity for any given ritual is largely produced by training, practice, social milieu, etc.<br/><br/>Does the fact that I can engage in the ritual of roleplaying mean I am pre-disposed to engaging with a Catholic mass? (Besides of course the 'well just /roleplay/ being Catholic' angle) How powerful would this predisposition have to be, to qualify as meaningful given all the other issues tied up with a Catholic mass? Are there any rituals that are de-natured of these other issues enough that we could see a clear relation between participation in them and in roleplaying games? It seems to me that other factors are overwhelmingly more important than any inherent (trained, born, or otherwise) lean towards ritual <i>in general</i>.<br/><br/>Or am I just playing roleplaying games in some way that sidesteps their ritual aspects, without even noticing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188438/#Comment_188438" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T05:35:51+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  5:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for misreading\u2026<br/><br/>I believe that most of us (human beings) need rituals. There are some among this majority that hate to think so. That may be an obstacle, but it is an obstacle for them towards the majority of activities, because most activities have a ritual component, which is more or less developed and more or less formal, which will create a more or less extreme reaction. I've known people who would have been interested in martial arts where it not for the opening and closing salutes. (Although it was never expressed as "I do not like rituals", but as an interpretation of the salute as a worship act, which was then rejected)<br/><br/>Maybe I should clarify what I consider ritual through examples (because I do not feel up to a formal definition): shaking hands or saluting, Christmas traditions (tree, shopping, family meetings, specific foods, decoration, carols,\u2026), coffee break with coworkers, Candlemas' pancakes, holidays, burials, inaugurations, hazing, goodbyes, Valentines, weddings, most public events (sport events, parades, \u2026), oaths, \u2026<br/><br/>IMhO ritual-adverse people do not seem like a very important concern in rpg except if you want to target them specifically. And I do not believe RPGers are a particularly ritual-loving bunch.<br/><br/>Now, the specific rituals we might use in rpg might add to the awkwardness of the gameplay. People fear to ridicule themselves by playing a rpg, ritual might add to this fear. I know that even after so many years of rpgaming, I still don't (like to) play in public (except if it's a gamer public, like at a con). Awkward ritual can aggravate this. But this feeling of awkwardness if one of the (or simply <i>the</i>)main reasons I find that I (we?) need a clear demarcation of game and out-of-game space. Through rituals.<br/><br/>IMhO, rituals are structure first, and may be color/flavor. They separate game from not-game, and may differentiate distinct phases in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188439/#Comment_188439" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T05:37:13+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  5:37AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, seems like you're talking about a fairly specific kind of ritual eperience, the one that gives that shared emotional glow, yeah?  Because, like, playing Monopoly is also a ritual, but I've never had a strong emotional reaction to playing Monopoly, except for this once where I was playing with my parents and brother at this beach cottage and it just felt *so right* for a short while, an experience that's hard to recreate.  Likewise, I don't usually feel that connection in roleplaying, just in specific instances of play with specific groups of people.  I think, if we want to really get at your topic here, we need to be a bit more specific about the kinds of rituals and the kinds of emotional engagement you're talking about.<br/><br/>I certainly think that there are games and forms of roleplaying that very deliberately attempt to get at that kind of highly emotional, connection-oriented ritual experience.  <i>A Flower for Mara</i> certainly seems to be one, as are many Jeep-influenced games.  However, I would also argue that some games that push for intensity or high drama -- such as Dogs in the Vineyard, Polaris, Burning Wheel, or the Riddle of Steel -- are aiming for it in an entirely different manner.  Even seemingly more laid-back games like, uh, <i>Sign in Stranger</i> and <i>Transantiago</i> (to name two games that aren't out yet, which is kinda cheating) attempt to create a social situation in which players have this intense creative flow between them, even if there is little of the tension that exists in Dogs or Burning Wheel or whatever.<br/><br/>Am I on the same page with you, yet?  If not, can you help me out?  I think there are shared traits in those seemingly diverse styles of play that relate to a certain approach to ritual experience, but I want to make sure that's what you want to talk about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188463/#Comment_188463" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T08:30:43+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  8:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Am I on the same page with you, yet?</blockquote>\nYes.

I'm glad you think I'm reading you right.<br/><br/>There's a few things that I can think of that help lead to the kind of emotional engagement with other people that you're talking about.  They're both things that are generally specific to a ritual environment, so I think you're right that ritual theory has some useful things to say here.<br/><br/>1. Roleplaying often creates the illusion that everyone is having the same or similar emotional experience, that you're actually feeling the emotions of others and so on.  I don't think this is actually the case, but rituals are really good (perhaps the best method we have) at perpetuating this feeling of sharedness.  It's like, "Hey, I'm having these really strong feelings and, unlike in 'real life' where that's a private thing, everybody else I'm playing with (at least) knows what I'm feeling and (at best) maybe even shares in it."<br/><br/>2. Roleplaying (like many other ritual forms) also forces players to deal with interpersonal tension, instead of avoiding it, dismissing it, or giving in to fight/flight responses like we monkeys normally do in 'real life.'  The GM-player split is the traditional way this happens, with the GM stomping all over your aspirations (as a player, not just a character) or at least providing resistance, even if that resistance is ultimately temporary or limited. In larp and more collaborative tabletop traditions of play, the other players provide this tension in a more dis-unified way that I would argue is actually <i>more effective</i> at pushing a player's buttons and facilitating <i>irresolvable tension</i>. That kind of tension is truly maddening in real life but creates an incredibly furtive creative and emotional environment as us monkeys look for every possible way to release tension and resolve the situation.  You know how you write better songs after a romantic breakup or if you have a massive crush on someone unattainable or have some pretty terrible things happen in your life?

They either reaffirm a (fictitious?) hold on reality of an individual or reaffirm his membership in a community. RPG can fill the member-of-a-community need for certain people at certain moments (ie adolescence, young adults), but I don't think this holds for older rpgamers.

In other words, I'm not really sure what the exact issue I'm trying to talk about is - I'm finding it hard to focus. I'm sorry, but this post will just be more rambling, attempting to define with words something that perhaps exists only as a metaphor.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>But you're saying that it's being able to resolve those instances, as they occur, that is a critical part of the feeling you want to talk about, not just the "oh crap what do I do with this" tension?

So yes, the ability to resolve those instances is probably key.<br/><br/>At the same time, though, the belief that role-playing is something we do together, that we're sharing this, like (a metaphor I've used before) we're creating a big, shining, golden ball between us, spinning it as we play along; that's important to me. <br/><br/>The act itself is the creation of events, people and things in the fiction; but that's only the focus of play, not its aim. The aim, for me, is that feeling of co-creation, of something that we're all contributing to, that couldn't exist if only one of us tried to do it, and that will disappear as soon as we stop feeding it. In my head, it looks a bit like <a href="http://www.whitegold.ca/images/earth-ball.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>, only that the ball is made up of our energies, it's shining, made of golden thread, and levitates between us; like <a href="http://case.jorune.net/jeux/rpg/jorune.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>, only bigger, not touching anybody.<br/><br/>What are the people in those two images engaging in?

No normal person fixes a flat tire as a symbolic act.  You fix it because you can't drive on it like that without the car's handling going to hell...not to mention screwing up your gas mileage, and also possibly damaging something.<br/><br/>You don't change a tire because it's June 30th, and lo, on that day your father and your father's father changed THEIR tire.  You don't change a tire to placate the all-knowing steel-belted spirit of Master Goodyear.  You don't change a tire for fun.  You don't change a tire so that you will be considered an adult by other drivers.  There's really no meaning hidden within the act at all: you just fix the damn tire because it's broken.<br/><br/>Any definition of ritual that is so weak as to include something as mundane as tire repair is probably too weak to be at all useful here.  It can't just be any set of actions we follow, or suddenly everything everyone does can be called a ritual, at which point no one can claim that anyone in the world ISN'T a ritual-minded person.  I inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide all day long, and always in that same order!  Oh no, I am a slave to ritual!  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><br/>Focusing the discussion on flow and how groups find a sort of shared emotional ground/sense of belonging/etc. definitely seems like a more productive direction for this thread to take.  I can totally accept how (a tighter definition of) ritual fits into that.<br/><br/>Although I wouldn't say that the online Harry Potter freeform players Matthijs mentioned earlier would be any less "ritual-minded" in that sense:  the flow of their interaction may not look like what happens at a gaming table, but I'm pretty sure they're aiming for the same general type of shared experience, and they almost certainly have their own little community processes and protocols that they follow in order to get there.  Whatever it is that drives some people to the keyboard to riff on Hogwart's instead of hunkering down at a table to roll dice, it ain't a lack of interest in ritual, I'm sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188592/#Comment_188592" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T02:32:00+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  2:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AfT, it sounds like, to you, a ritual has to be something you do with the specific conscious intention that you'll partake in a ritual; that it has to have a symbolic value outside of the practice itself; that it must be tied to tradition.

He's saying that roleplaying games are not "often thought to have symbolic value," and therefore they do not seem to be rituals to him. You seem to be sidestepping a major component of the definition you introduced.<br/><br/>Because I think we can point to actions <i>within</i> a roleplaying game that are often thought to have symbolic value (things people do with their dice, how certain phrases are used, etc.) but I don't see a lot of people claiming that roleplaying games themselves have a symbolic value.<br/><br/>For example, as far as I know people think there is a value to a Catholic Mass as a whole; it serves a ritual purpose, as part of Catholic worship. (This value is related to other individual rituals within the Mass which have their own symbolic content.) I welcome correction from more knowledgeable people than me, of course, but the key seems to be that the activity at large has a symbolic layer.<br/><br/>The roleplaying activity at large does not seem to have a comparable symbolic layer -- and I don't mean 'all of roleplaying' necessarily, I mean even 'any given session.' Or at least, I don't think it is <i>obvious</i> that it does; I am open to opinions otherwise. But it seems like until someone provides an argument for this higher level of symbolic value attached either to the activity at large or at least the most common scale on which the activity takes place, the idea of 'roleplaying as ritual' instead of 'roleplaying as an activity that involves some specific rituals' seems to be in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188599/#Comment_188599" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T02:57:47+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  2:57AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>you wouldn't happen to have an accessible working definition, even a simplified one?

For a primer on the discussion I suggest either the article "Ritual, Emotion and Sacred Symbols" by Alcorta &amp; Sosis (2004), which you can find online, or McCauley &amp; Lawson's book "Bringing Ritual to Mind" (2002), which is far more useful to layman readers.

It's more practical. For me, it's the same as saying roll a die and jump as many squares in snakes and ladders. Maybe you could get symbolism if you were saying the die is fate.<blockquote>"Eat this biscuit, it's Jesus' flesh"</blockquote>Here we have symbolism, but I have to say it is very tricky to analyse this, even more with no proper tool, even more because <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php" rel="nofollow">it is a sensitive subject</a>. Here something is attached to a completely unrelated but very specific object, and from this association you get an "effect" on the real world.<blockquote>"Reduce this number on your character sheet by one, your best friend is now dead".</blockquote>I find the order you present these two sentences disturbing, because they seem to imply a causal relationship between them where IMhO they are two tied consequences of something else, here unspecified, maybe another die roll. Its not symbolic at all for me, for the same reasons as above.<br/><br/>BUT, I do not have a working definition of symbol. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol" rel="nofollow">wikipedia definition</a> is once again too wide to be practical, as any act of language or representation is symbolic by this definition. Combine with wikipedia's definition of rituals and few things in human life are not rituals.<br/><br/>As we have no working definition, a quick google search revealed nothing useful, maybe we should be more specific and either define ritual (and maybe symbols) or debate about what are ritual's feature and how they apply in rpg. Or maybe we can work through some detailled examples to align our "gut definitions".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188603/#Comment_188603" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T04:40:16+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  4:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2009 4:45AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>but don't you think that when I roll a die and say "My elf killed the monster", that's a pretty clear symbolic layer attached to the practice?

At least not if you are a practicing Catholic. I mean they are literally eating Jesus' flesh, within the symbolism of the ritual in question. A symbol is not the same thing as imagining a relationship between two things, like metaphor, or even imagining a causal relationship between two things: when I say that X is a symbol for Y I mean that there is a literal transposition of the two objects. This bread is not /like/ Jesus' flesh, it does not cause me to imagine myself eating Jesus' flesh -- it <i>is</i> Jesus' flesh. The two objects are equivalent.<br/><br/>A roleplaying parallel, for example, might be that if I destroyed your character sheet your character was annihilated from the fiction. There are some games that play with that sort of relationship (see: Mist-Robed Gate, and Puppetland I think?) but even then I am not sure it's quite the same thing. Other things in the game usually control when the symbolism is active. Though I suppose that is probably true in rituals as well; I am not sure however if the wine can ever stop being His blood, once the transubstantiation has been performed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188604/#Comment_188604" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T05:10:17+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  5:10AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>those two statements are not equivalent.

I've partaken in the eating of the biscuit. I've never believed it was Jesus' flesh for real, though. And I still think I was partaking in a ritual.

And yes, for me, the co-creation and togetherness in the activity is important. When I GM, these days, I mostly take the role of, um, "keeper of the ritual" - I say what procedures we follow and when, and make sure we stick to them; I try to make sure things flow as they should, according to the traditions we've created. I also accept changes to the procedures, or initiate them.

To recognize that it may even play a role in role-playing games, even the most traditional ones, is close to obvious.<br/><br/>The golden question is; How?<br/><br/>How do we put ourselves into <i>the interactive flow</i> that characterize the very best of role-playing games? I find that it may be done in both classical and modern rpgs. I have been there more often in classical games myself, but have a fair share of experiences with "golden game-play" in modern games too.<br/><br/>So; in my experience there is several roads to this goal; several ways of organizing "the ritual of game-play".  I do believe that "ritual" (at some level, including symbolism) is active in any kind of role-playing game, and essential to our chance of making the great sessions. We happen upon it, mostly, but it is possible to reproduce these sessions (at least partially), so I believe there are some great design-tools to be discovered here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188614/#Comment_188614" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T06:17:50+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  6:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2009 6:18AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/Alcorta-Sosis2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">The article indicated by Tuomas</a> (thanks!) is quite easy to find, but as it is 53 pages long so I won't read that just now\u2026<br/><br/>There was an interesting \u201c<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4497" rel="nofollow">Ritual and gaming</a>\u201d thread about rituals here in October 2007, I took the liberty to copy here the passages that interest me most.<br/><br/>About formal/academical study of ritual in rpg:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Someting I looked at a lot in my anthropology thesis was the unconscious rituals that a lot of gaming groups use to re-enforce status, to signal in-game and out-of-game, to flag discomfort, and a lot of other things.<br/><br/>Food was frequently a focus of ritual.  Bringing snacks to the GM's house shows respect to the host, but it's also kind of a status signifier, saying "thanks for running the game".  It re-enforces the social roles of the players.  Conversely, the GM might serve food to the players, signifying a different kind of relationship.  Whatever the ritual was, it was usually repeated every game.  For example, in one group I observed, the players would always come to the GM's house first, and then everyone, including the GM, would go to the store for snacks.  There was a very different relationship between the players than in another group, where the GM never bought snacks.  The way food was shared, all in the middle of the table, or each to their own, was also significant.  The type of food was usually ritually defined as well.  It's weird if everyone's eating chocolate and chips, and one person brings apples.  The type of food eaten might signal the tone of the game.  For example, junk food often signals a relaxed, fun game, while more substantial food might signal a more serious tone.<br/><br/>The way people talk often has ritual significance.  For example, GMs I've played with often distinguish by their tone if they're doing "Dramatic Intro" - solid facts about the setting or scene, or just discussing ideas.  Information for the whole party is often spoken more forcefully, while information for a single player is spoken more conversationally.  Players who make a habit of speaking in character might distinguish between "important, character stuff" which is done in character, using accents and whatever, with less important stuff, which is communicated in a normal tone.  Usually other players recognise these ritualistic uses of tone and pick up on the extra layers of meaning.  For example, people are more reluctant to challenge GM narration if it's done in the declamatory style than if it's phrased more colloquially.<br/><br/>Out of character jokes are often used to defuse uncomfortable scenes, or to bring the spotlight away from players who are demanding too much attention.  In a lot of games I watched, out-of-character comments were used to discharge tension after important scenes.  Two players got into an in-character argument, which involved a lot of raised voices and eye contact.  Laughing afterwards and making jokes signaled the end of the conflict, but it also re-enforced the "in character/out of character" divide.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my (slightly over-informed) take on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: schlafmanko</cite>Simon, that's neat.  I've seen the sorts of things you're talking about, but especially with regard to food practices, it wouldn't have occurred to me to call them ritual.  Who did you use for theory of ritual in your thesis?  I'm asking because I come from a religious studies background, so I tend to get my theory from Catherine Bell, J. Z. Smith, and other people who see ritual as distinguishing itself from "everyday" ways of acting or paying attention.   I don't want to turn this thread into a pedantic argument about what counts as ritual -- probably it's more interesting to construe ritual broadly here -- but I am curious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>You're right that it's a pretty broad definition of ritual, and to be honest I'm an incredibly lazy academic, so I shied away from formally engaging with much established theory of ritual (because a lot of it is boring and crap).  I guess I used a definition pretty similar to Bell's, that "distinguished from everyday" thing.  However, in my thesis I was also using "ritual" in the much more colloquial sense "things we do regularly and the same way every time" or "action that has a meaning other than what is directly indicated".  I think that a lot of the rituals can be described as "distinguishing from the everyday", but focusing on that can sometimes lead to really unintuitive understandings of the rituals. Buying snacks, for example, can be seen as establishing the "play" atmosphere of the game as seperate from everyday interaction, but it's much more useful to look at what it says about the relationships between the players.</blockquote>\nSo we have some stabs at definitions here.<br/><br/>[continued\u2026]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188616/#Comment_188616" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T06:19:47+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  6:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [\u2026 continued]<br/><br/>A reaction more or less against ritualized games:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Of course I know that groups have rituals. I'm lamenting the current trend to hardwire them into games.<br/><br/>See, we've got our own ritual. In our Wednesday group, we get ourselves in the mood for gaming by playing a little game with Simon's daughter first, making a cup of tea and then settling down to play. That's our ritual.<br/><br/>But a few games want us to read a chunk of flavour text or light a candle or similar, too. And we don't really need that. We've got our own ritual. We don't need the one in the book.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd later:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>1. I find studying rituals in groups interesting, too.<br/>2. However, we shouldn't necessarily assume that we can produce the same effect by describing those rituals in a book. Just because our group cooks food during the first half of our game, then breaks to eat it, then continues over cheese and biscuits, doesn't mean that ritual will be useful if I describe it in a game.<br/>3. Things have a habit of becoming fads in indie RPGs: I'd argue Key Phrases and Fan Mail both went down this route. They're used unthinkingly, because they're interesting, rather than to produce a specific effect. I'm slightly worried rituals will be the next big thing.<br/><br/>For the third point, I'm probably mainly thinking about unpublished games in Game Chef.

Defining ritual narrowly, as it looks like people want to do in this thread, would seem to cut off many important avenues of discussion.  Indeed, even among scholars who study ritual, the definition is open for debate, <i>as it should be</i>, just as any definition of roleplaying is going to be found problematic.  That's why I was trying to get at what Matthijs was really interested in discussing, instead of focusing on big picture issues.  My preference, in regards to the big picture, is defining ritual as broadly as possible and then looking at specific areas or issues within it, because we shouldn't limit ourselves needlessly, but talking about things at the level of "real broad" leads to really vague statements that don't count for much.<br/><br/>The big picture for me looks like this:<br/>1. any action that is performed over and over again becomes ritualized; many, many elements of roleplaying are repeated in this fashion<br/>2. social interactions, over time, also become ritualized; this is what creates the social contract, which doesn't need to be intentionally or explicitly described by the participants <br/>3. rituals do not have to signify anything other than what they are.<br/><br/>I would go so far as to say that lighting the candle before beginning the first session of a Polaris game is only a ritual <i>in so far as candle-lighting and the behaviors that accompany it (such as reading aloud from texts) are already ritualized for participants, from their previous experiences.</i>  If I instructed players, in a game text, to drop their dice on the floor, that would not be ritualized, probably, until the third or fourth time they did it (or maybe more), because dropping dice is a normal, un-ritualized thing that already happens in roleplaying fairly regularly.  Now, if you recited some phrase when you dropped the dice ("Once again I cast the stones!"), then it becomes ritualized, not necessarily because it signifies anything, but because reciting phrases is already a ritualized behavior for most people, drawing on religious rituals and other ritual experiences.<br/><br/>I don't think roleplayers are ritual-minded or seek ritual anymore than other people.  Sure, in some cases, it may fulfill individuals' need for ritual that might otherwise be fulfilled in other ways: going to church, going bowling with your buddies, whatever.  But modern life, while it has changed the places in which people commonly go to find ritual, is not as devoid of ritual practices as one might suspect.  As I indicated above, anything that happens regularly becomes ritualized over time, especially if it is performed with the same people.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.  Matthijs is probably coming from somewhere different, as is everybody else.  Do we really have to agree on all this before we can begin to have a discussion?  I really hope not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryuuchiba" title="ryuuchiba"><img alt="ryuuchiba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryuuchiba">ryuuchiba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188728/#Comment_188728" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T16:47:05+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  4:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's the ritual in the idea of rites of passage from V.

If we go looking, we might miss the things that are right in front of us. Specific phrases, etc. are all good to consider, but the very basics are already ritualistic. We have ritual objects. The dice resolve things for us and are invoked in a very ritualistic manner. We have sacred texts which outline how we conduct our ritual. We have holy days when we attend ritual (oddly, our gaming group has one solid gaming day and it has always been sunday). We have ritual roles.

Folks who look at some of the acts or events mentioned and say, "nope, no ritual there!" are missing something, from my perspective--discounting an act because it's commpnplace, or has a practical purpose, or whatever. Of <i>course</i> ritual has a practical purpose. that's why humans use it so persistently and consistently. There can be direct practical value in the act itself (such as a ritual meal--people need to eat), but even in the absence of that there are emotional, role-dictating and social-bonding needs that rituals address.<br/><br/>For instance, changing a tire is TOTALLY a ritual in my upbringing, a male rite-of-passage that demonstrates one's competence in performing "manly" duties according to a societal norm. My Dad would v\\never have called it a "male rite-of-passage ritual" of course, and I didn't have that vocabulary to express it either, but when he said, "Son, let me show you how to change a tire," there was no doubt in my mind what was taking place. My dad made similar rituals out of chopping wood and playing competent basketball and football. (I failed each and every one of these manhood rituals, by the way.)<br/><br/>It seems obvious that roleplaying is particularly pregnant with ritual. The procedures themselves are ritualistic, and using them to create a Shared Imagined Space is about as ritual an act as I can fathom. I say, from behind my rune-emblazoned screen, "an Orc burst through the doorway and attacks!" I toss my die, consult it, and declare, "he hits!" And here's the key part: everyone at the table <i>totally buys that this "happens."</i> Nobody's going, "OK, dude, whatever. I'm grabbing a beer." At least, if people are disengaged in that way, you don't have functional roleplaying. instead, you've got folks goin, "Oh! Another hit like that and I'm a goner!" or "I'lI circle around and attack him from behind!" "or "is he vulnerable to Frost spells?" That can only happen in a ritual space. And yes, all games create ritual spaces of some kind.<br/><br/>I'm not too worried about this broad a definition of ritual rendering the term meaningless or useless. those who don't see or value the ritual in everyday things may not care, but given that <i>I care</i>, or Matthijs cares, what can we-who-care do with it? The way I see it, it's not identifying or creating some ultra-rare and elusive Ritual Moment that appears only When the Stars Are Right that's the point. It's rather, recognizing that <i>ritual is all around</i>, that we then focus on harnessing and directing that ritual force toward your particular ends, say, in a specific arrangement of game design. Which is what Matthijs is looking for, I think.<br/><br/>(Also, just 'cause you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen, or that it doesn't have it's effect. it just means that you don't notice--it's invisible, behind the scenes, and you're not able or interested in examining it. And that's fine! It still happens, and it works.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So--I'm not sure if I have any concrete suggestions for you, Matthijs. I think the idea of a specific act that signals, "enough chitchat, time for game" is appealing. But Graham's point, about every group developing their own instead of being prescribed one by a game text, resonates with me too.<br/><br/>The thing is that while gamers are ritual-minded, they're also fiercely individualistic. They often bristle at an attempt to control or even advise their behavior--"Ain't no rulebook/GM/fancy website gonna tell ME how to play!" And that's just regarding actual <i>game procedures</i>; something that's perceived as "out of game" or "just fluff" or "play advice" gets even less respect. So for every group that wholeheartedly embraces the Polaris Candle or the Beast Hunters Salute, there'll be another who bridles at the very suggestion, and may even be turned off to the whole game.<br/><br/>Perhaps stating firmly the need for <i>A</i> beginning ritual, to mark off the play time and space, would be good, while letting the group construct their own? You could provide some mood-appropriate suggestions, and let them take it from there.

You don't go to the football/icehockey/local sport games. You fail at the regular manhood rituals. Not a rare thing to hear in those kinds of circles. However, to affirm their identity and nature, to oneself and others, everyone needs rituals. There's lots in nerddom in general and as outlined, there's lots in role-playing. Just a thought - and I freely admit the over-generalization. There is overlap to role-playing and nerddom, but one is not the other, either.<br/><br/>More than that though I look at role-playing games as sort of modern mystery religions, vision-questing or even magick. We teach/learn/experience through ritual what is not immediately apparent to the uninitiated, but which requires (mutual and ritual) effort and imagination (intent) to contrive and reveal. What folks take out of the imagined lives of our characters (we are channeling archetypes here, right?), the symbols present in gaming, the divination tools that reveal the sacred lives of those characters (yeah, dice, dude), etc. varies from person to person and game to game, but it is clear that we get more out of it than simple on-the-spot enjoyment. We get a sense of community with our fellow gamers by spending time with them and engaging in ritualistic behaviour. By acting out stories, we get a sense of continuity and personal connection to our myths and history. We dip into insights into human nature and about ourselves. So, by exploring the Otherworld, we bring back the Elixir. We don't just imagine heroes, we become them.<br/><br/>- Joachim Buchert -                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189966/#Comment_189966" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T07:43:06+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  7:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2009 8:22AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &amp;ls;rant&gt;I do not search a formal nor an academic definition of rituals. But it seems obvious to me that we aren\u2019t on the same page about what rituals are, that is to say we do not agree on what we are talking about. That\u2019s why I was asking if there was an handy existing definition.

I don\u2019t care about an official definition, but I\u2019d like to know what the subject at hand is.&amp;ls;/rant&gt;<br/><br/>So\u2026 the article, as promised\u2026 <i>Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols: The Evolution of Religion as an Adaptive Complex</i>, Candace S. Alcorta and Richard Sosis, Dep. Of Antrhopology, U. of Connecticut. I\u2019ll just summarize the points that (IMhO) are of interest for this discussion. (Or generally interesting.) (There are other interesting things in there, e.g. if you want to create a religion for a setting.) (Bear in mind that most things are in the article only to carry their demonstration.) (Also, as I summarize I may accidentally deform, oversimplify or over generalize the information. Assume all errors are mine.)<br/><br/>Ritual is viewed in context of religion and as being built (evolved) from animal rituals roots. Rituals in this context are essentially teaching/conforming rituals and communal rituals, the later being close to the \u201cgoing golden\u201d phenomenon we discuss here.<br/><br/>The \u201csummary\u201d is quite long and I do not (yet) transpose it to rpg.<br/><br/><i>Animal rituals</i><br/><br/>The formality, patterning, repetition and rhythms of religious rituals have direct parallels in animal ritualized display. Some examples of those displays: courtship rituals, including courtship songs and nest constructions of male bowerbirds; friendship greetings rituals of baboons. <i>Those ritualized display are behavior whose sole and primary function is communication</i>, as opposed to behaviors that are incidentally informative. They have evolved to communicate within a species and with other species. Animal rituals can be fixed, context-insensitive, or can incorporate many variants and individually learned patterns and may be very malleable and may be very context dependant.<br/><br/>The signals used in innate rituals have, through evolution, emancipated from their original function from behaviors where communication was an incidental benefit, and been transferred to new contexts. The associated responses are still tied to the original function of the signal.<br/><br/>Elaborate rituals are \u201ccostly\u201d: one need time, energy and work to perform them. There probably was and is a ritual arm-race inside and between species, leading to the complication of rituals, which means increased cost. Increased cost means that the authentic ritual is more difficult to falsify and works as a selection mechanism: only those fit enough can correctly perform the ritualized display.<br/><br/>Rituals convey simultaneously behavioral intent and important information regarding the status and condition of the sender.<br/><br/>Performing rituals elicits neurophysiological changes: it alerts and focuses attention, enhances memory and promotes associational learning. Theses changes improve the ability of the receiver to assess both the signal and the sender\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d.<br/><br/>Performing a ritual prime both sender and receiver for action and elicits neuroendocrine responses that influence social behavior. The type of action that results is dependant both upon the receiver\u2019s assessment of the sender and upon the encoded \u201caction releasers\u201d embedded within the ritual.<br/><br/>Animal ritual functions to communicate social information and to coordinate social behaviors through the use of species\u2019 specific signals evolved to elicit neurophysiological responses.<br/><br/>[continued\u2026]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189967/#Comment_189967" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T07:43:58+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  7:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Religious ritual</i><br/><br/>Like animal ritualized display, human religious ritual is demarcated from ordinary behaviors and is composed of the same encoded elements: formality, patterning, sequencing and repetition. They also incorporate signals that serve as \u201caction releasers\u201d, signals of dominance and submission. As in animal ritual, such signals serve to elicit innate or learned neurophysiological responses in participants. <br/><br/>Religious ritual incorporates learned signals, for example masks, statues, other representations, icons,\u2026 They elicit attention and heighten emotion. Incorporation of evocative, grotesque and dissonant features intensifies such responses.<br/><br/>However, the fundamental elements of human rituals are abstract symbols without any innate or inherent meaning. This means that <i>the significance of abstract religious symbols must be created, both cognitively and emotionally</i>. Animal ritual elicits behavior through encoded signals, <i>religious ritual elicits behavior to encode signals. The creation of these symbols provides ritual tools for the shaping of social behaviors. Ritual participation generates belief</i>.<br/><br/>Religious ritual not only identifies that which is sacred, separates it from the profane, but also <i>creates the sacred</i>. (E.g. Holy water is transformed through ritual.) The critical distinction between the sacred and the profane being the emotional charging associated with sacred things (like \u201cawe\u201d, \u201cpurity\u201d, \u201cdanger\u201d). This distinction in emotional valence is created through participation in religious ritual.<br/><br/><i>Emotional charge (valence), learning</i><br/><br/>Emotions motivate behavior. They are evolved adaptations that weight decisions and influence actions. They are out of conscious control and difficult to fake, hence they are reliable communication signals, useful for rituals.<br/><br/>Emotions are elicited by internal or external sensory stimuli. The first processing of stimuli appears to be based on a positive/approach vs. negative/withdrawal division.<br/><br/>Positive stimuli activate the (dopaminergic) reward system. It creates positive motivation toward a goal. The repeated activation of this system reproduces the positive association from goal-intrinsic stimuli to associated stimuli, which were previously neutral. This is \u201cincentive learning\u201d.<br/><br/>Negative stimuli are critical in the rapid appraisal of potential danger or threats and elicit a greater response than positive ones. Negative stimuli activate a cascade of neuroendocrine events that prepare the organism to rapidly respond to threats and danger. These responses are hard wired into the nervous system. Neutral stimuli may also acquire negative valence by association. This kind of conditioning is hard to reverse.<br/><br/>Much emotional learning occurs on an unconscious level.<br/><br/>Religious rituals share a neurophysiological substrate with animal ritualized displays, as they both incorporate elements that evoke extensive autonomic and neuroendocrine changes in participants. But also, the uniquely human elements of religious ritual contribute to these neurophysiological effects.<br/><br/><i>Rhythm</i><br/><br/>Human ritual shares with animal one basic structural components of formality, pattern, sequence, and repetition. Human religious ritual further amplifies and intensifies these elements through the incorporation of rhythmic drivers.<br/><br/>Rhythmic drivers include music, chanting and dance. They have significant neurophysiological effects. They are a recurrent and important component of religious ritual worldwide.<br/><br/>Rhythmic drivers synchronize internal rhythms to external auditory ones. Affected biological system include respiration, brain wave patterns, pulse rate, blood pressure, muscles, skin, \u2026 Rhythmic drivers have emotion inducing effects, with varying intensity and valence. Musically induced changes appear to be very close to \u201cnatural\u201d ones.<br/><br/>Rhythmic drivers also instantiate the structure of ritual through their formality, repetition, sequence and pattern.<br/><br/>[continued\u2026]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189968/#Comment_189968" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T07:45:16+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  7:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Rhythmic drivers in rituals</i><br/><br/>Participation in religious ritual induce neurophysiological changes. These changes are a stimuli that kick off emotional processing in both positive and negative systems. Rhythmic drivers can intensify the neurophysiological effects of rituals and thus are a mean to create highly aroused and intense shared emotional states in participants.<br/><br/>The emotion rhythmic driver most often evokes is happiness, which, in its most intense version, may reach ecstasy, and is not unlike that attained through  the use of drugs. These positive emotions can then bind positive meanings to other stimuli. Negative emotions can also be used that way, using physical and mental ordeals, creating powerful and indelible neurophysiological substrate for the emotional conditioning of religious symbols. Here, rhythmic driver ease the learning.<br/><br/><i>Religious rituals create social cohesion.</i><b> Here we go golden</b><br/><br/>The ritually evoked emotions are quickly and easily perceived by members of the same culture. The use of rhythmic drivers in ritual to evoke and amplify emotions provides a mechanism for the ritual synchronization of motivational and physical states among participants (\u201ceffervescence\u201d or \u201ccommunitas\u201d). Empathy is contingent upon such shared states. Rhythmic drivers provides the associational context for the creation of <i>communally</i> sacred through the conditioned association of such states with symbolic words, objects and places. Subsequent use of such symbols to evoke conditionally associated emotions provides a mechanism for eliciting reliable empathetic experiences among adherents across time and space. Through the creation of emotionally charged communal symbols, religious ritual constructs the neurophysiologival scaffolding for empathy, trust, and cooperative group enterprises. Ritual creates social solidarity. Religious ritual contributes to intergroup alliances.<br/><br/><i>Group membership</i><br/>Religious symbols serve as signals of membership. The ability of religious symbols to evoke shared emotional responses in adherents outside the bounds of ritual provides a mechanism for motivating and coordinating individual behaviors.<br/><br/>Ritual further functions to decrease individual stress through the stabilization of social organization and provides a mean of facilitating both group fission/fusion and the coordination of group activities.<br/><br/><i>Symbols as ritual-generated portable rituals</i><br/><br/>While animal ritual encodes signals as neurophysiological primes for behavior, religious ritual encodes symbols created through the ritual process itself.<br/><br/>The use of ritual to create associations linking symbolic, social and affective systems provided social groups with a highly flexible tool for motivating individual behavior, forging inter-group alliances, and for discriminating between friends and enemies.<br/><br/>The use of rhythmic ritual to invest artifacts with symbolic, emotionally-valenced meaning provide dispersed groups with a tangible and motivational symbol of the abstract social relationships codified through ritual process. The symbols of religious rituals a mean of engendering congruent motivational states across space and time. Religious symbols thus provide tools for creating cooperative coalitions across time.<br/><br/>[The End]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190290/#Comment_190290" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T14:13:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  2:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thank you, everyone. very informative &amp; enjoyable. good point about the nerddom &amp; rituals of manhood.<br/><br/>Matthijs, help me here:<br/>are you looking at how we get to that place where we (you or i) feel as if everyone at the table with us is feeling what we are feeling?<br/>are you looking to be able to get there more reliably, and thinking that a ritual might serve as a path, a trail of bread crumbs?<br/>or are you looking to get to that place where, afterwards, everyone confirms that their minds were also being blown, that they too<br/>had the golden experience?<br/><br/>so, techniques then? /even really knowing and trusting and genuinely liking all the other people at the table, even more: hanging on their words,<br/>feeling like you're at a concert by your favorite band or a reading by your favorite poet-<br/>you (you lucky jerk) seem to be taking that as a given. i mean, damn, i play with some hot maker-uppers, but not all at once.<br/><br/>use your science! what was in place when you had that golden situation? <br/>for me, i had some gold when playing Don't Rest Your Head at night, one-on-one, quietly whispering almost as my too-thin-walled house slept around us.<br/>the space was created to make the quiet, desperate, lonely situation of the protagonist unfold.<br/><br/>if you are done with this thread i will start a new one, but first i wanted to ask you about your specificity.<br/>the structures you want- what are they more like, what are they less like? specific games, i mean. more like what, less like what.<br/>and if you and i were sitting at a table, how would we- strangers, but for the internet- get to a place where we can spin a yarn into gold?<br/>would the both of us enjoying some piece of art and discussing it casually (not facing one another, facing the art) help?<br/><br/>wanting to know,<br/>jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190307/#Comment_190307" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T15:19:52+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  3:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to everyone who's been posting.

I never write posts of this length, but this seems to be a more-or-less complete summing-up of where I am right now with respect to ritual, flow and group dynamics, and it's taken some years to get here... so I guess it needed to be this long. [/EDIT]<br/><br/>I've been reading a little bit in a book <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=183941" rel="nofollow">recommended by Jonathan</a>, called <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kVI8ZX2ma7sC&amp;dq=ritual+sincerity&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8m65hexgS&amp;sig=jYf40gIKVLkY-gA3--Wq0PcoE1w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7BuISYqwI4yT-gbWwujUBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" rel="nofollow">Ritual and Its Consequences</a>. If you read the first 26 pages, which are viewable online, and the Lehrich and Ericsson articles that Jituomas referenced above, you know as much as I do about ritual theory, I guess.<br/><br/>My position right now is that play itself is a ritual. When we participate in a role-playing session, we're performing a ritual. There's a specific point, often noticeable, when the leader/keeper of the ritual - often the GM, sometimes the host or someone else - says "the game starts now", and then we're in ritual time, so to speak. After that, conversation is structured according to certain rules, written and/or unwritten, that are different from everyday conversation*. <br/><br/>And <i>during this ritual</i>, we create the shining ball - we can "go golden". This happens, in my experience/opinion, when we perform well, when the challenges we meet are at the appropriate level - when all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#Components_of_flow" rel="nofollow">components of flow</a> are present. This requires that the group has reached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forming-storming-norming-performing" rel="nofollow">performing</a> stage of group development.<br/><br/>This means, again in my opinion and experience, that in order to "go golden", a group <i>must</i> (from the description of a "performing" group) "function as a unit (...) without inappropriate conflict or the need for external supervision. Team members have become interdependent. (...) The team members are now competent, autonomous and able to handle the decision-making process without supervision. Dissent is expected and allowed as long as it is channeled through means acceptable to the team. Supervisors of the team during this phase are almost always participative." In other words, it's probably necessary for the GM to be a participant - not just an arbiter, referee or facilitator. This indicates that there <i>are</i> certain ritual structures that may be better if the group wants to "go golden" - specifically, those that allow for the participants' autonomy and the supervisor's participation.<br/><br/>So when Melinglor says:\n<blockquote>And here's the key part: everyone at the table totally buys that this "happens." Nobody's going, "OK, dude, whatever. I'm grabbing a beer." At least, if people are disengaged in that way, you don't have functional roleplaying. instead, you've got folks goin, "Oh! Another hit like that and I'm a goner!" or "I'lI circle around and attack him from behind!" "or "is he vulnerable to Frost spells?" That can only happen in a ritual space.</blockquote>\n...I sort of agree. I think that dissent can be destructive in a group, but doesn't have to be. If the group has reached the "performing" stage, there is room for dissent - someone can say "no, that didn't happen" without breaking the game. However, it must be "channeled through means acceptable to the team": We have rules or procedures in place to handle it, whether this is done through Universalis' rules of coins and dice, or through Archipelago's ritual phrases.<br/><br/>(Continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190969/#Comment_190969" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T03:12:28+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  3:12AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (...continued from above)<br/><br/>Do I believe that everyone else is feeling what I'm feeling when we "go golden"?

We often have to go into discussions and reestablish a consensus reality, a shared agreement of the current state of the fiction, before we start the next session.<br/>- Yes, I believe that most of us are experiencing flow. I can't be entirely sure, but the look on people's faces and the way we seem to talk intently and interestedly seems to indicate this. I might post a questionnaire to my group about this, actually.<br/><br/>As Jackson mentions, "knowing and trusting and genuinely liking all the other people at the table" might also be a requirement. I feel this way towards my group.\n<blockquote>and if you and i were sitting at a table, how would we- strangers, but for the internet- get to a place where we can spin a yarn into gold?<br/>would the both of us enjoying some piece of art and discussing it casually (not facing one another, facing the art) help?</blockquote>\nI believe we would need to like each other - whether instantaneously, or as something that happened over time. I also believe we would need to practice for some time before getting to that place. In my experience, getting to know people in the group at the same time as the group is going through the first stages of group dynamics is a good thing. The exploratory and open mindset one has, makes both things extra cool and charged.<br/><br/>So what happens after? Joachim says,\n<blockquote>We get a sense of community with our fellow gamers by spending time with them and engaging in ritualistic behaviour. By acting out stories, we get a sense of continuity and personal connection to our myths and history. We dip into insights into human nature and about ourselves. So, by exploring the Otherworld, we bring back the Elixir. We don't just imagine heroes, we become them.</blockquote>\nThis is talking about the content, not the ritual structures or the group dynamic processes. I know that the rituals and processes used to "go golden" seem to support specific types of content, but I'm not sure what that means. After our last Archipelago session, we talked about what sort of characters we'd created, how some of us used them to "discuss" specific personal issues, and how different game systems helped in that "discussion". In Archipelago, there's a lot of room for giving and taking input on your character, and these suggestions from the group helped shaping the changes our characters went through. Since accepting the changes is always voluntary, the player is always in control of his/her character's development, and thus, the resolution of his/her "discussion". But not all players do this with their characters, it seems. Again, I'm not sure what that means.<br/><br/>(Ajax, I haven't read the article summary yet. Any chance you could digest it/sum it up for us?)<br/><br/>* During this, people may do things that seemingly break with ritual (like going out for a smoke, punching another player's arm when they say something silly, or make fun of the GM), but I don't think that's very important - these things happen at lots of rituals. For an example from a Jewish ceremony where the attendants challenge the rabbi with humorous comments, see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rabbis-Cat-2-Joann-Sfar/dp/0375425071" rel="nofollow">The Rabbi's Cat"</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190981/#Comment_190981" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T06:10:23+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  6:10AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2009 1:15PM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a lot to digest\u2026 I'll leave time for all that to sink.<br/><br/>About the article, I'd sum its most interesting points like this (beware, that's my take on it):<br/>* ritual exists in animals, it gives an evolutionary advantage, human ritual evolved from animal ritual<br/>* ritual, among other things, helps coordinating people, helps empathy, helps forming and maintaining coherent groups<br/>* ritual elicit emotional responses that neurophysically alter behaviors and prime participants for some relevant action<br/>[* in religious ritual, ritual also "teaches" by linking an emotional response to an abstract symbol, thereby transforming them in a kind of insta-portable-ritual]<br/>* empathy, feeling of togetherness, of ecstasy, sharing of emotions are greatly helped by the use of rhythmic drivers, ie music, chanting, dance.<br/><br/>However, I think the authors' definition of ritual is a bit different than yours. I am not sure they'd read RPG as ritual in the same way that you do.<br/><br/>And, er, I like <i>The Rabbi's Cat</i> very much ^_^<br/><br/>[edit: a good deal of typos]

If you and I are on our way to lunch together, and we meet a weird street person along the way, when we tell people about the incident afterwards we'll have different stories. You might go "met a weird guy today, then we had this great jellyfish pizza lunch!" I might go "I'm still freaked out from that guy we met, I think Willem was too, because afterwards he said some things that just changed my view of the world" - and not even remember what we had for lunch.<br/><br/>However, what happens (for me) in role-playing games - as separate from casual social interaction - is that we agree to converge on this one thing that we're co-experiencing. We have a feeling of community, of working on the same SiS. Our experiences will diverge, but not in the same way; we've got a ritual going on, we're creating an "as-if"-space, a consensus reality that we at least act and - when everything gels - <i>feel </i>like we share.<br/><br/>(I have a fairly fundamental belief that we can't know what somebody else experiences, and that we probably experience <i>everything </i>differently; that belief seeps through into this discussion.

Could it be an analogue of immersion in more sim-oriented play?]<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>This happens, in my experience/opinion, when we perform well, when the challenges we meet are at the appropriate level - when all the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#Components_of_flow" rel="nofollow">components of flow</a>are present. This requires that the group has reached theperformingstage of group development.<br/><br/>This means, again in my opinion and experience, that in order to "go golden", a group<i>must</i>(from the description of a "performing" group) "function as a unit (...) without inappropriate conflict or the need for external supervision. Team members have become interdependent. (...) The team members are now competent, autonomous and able to handle the decision-making process without supervision. Dissent is expected and allowed as long as it is channeled through means acceptable to the team. Supervisors of the team during this phase are almost always participative.".</blockquote>It struck me that "components of flow" [edit: at least] and "performing stage" [edit: maybe] are merely descriptive elements of when gold spontaneously happens. I believe these aren't necessary nor sufficient if one's goal is specifically to go golden instead of waiting for it to happen.<br/><br/>For me this golden feeling is akin to an altered state of consciousness (an hypothesis which is imho supported by your description and by your reference to flow theory; group dynamics seems unrelated), shared by the group. There are many ways to reach for that: different kind of meditations, rituals, music/chant/dancing, drugs, ... Of course, hitting the right state isn't evident, the more so for first timers who don't know what to reach for. It also seems that some experienced groups slowly and mostly unconsciously learn to reach towards that state.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>This indicates that there<i>are</i>certain ritual structures that may be better if the group wants to "go golden"</blockquote> I, also, believe one could design a gaming session to facilitate access to this kind of consciousness states.

However, I don't know of any other ones that I've tried.

What I mean by "participant" here is someone who contributes actively to the fiction/SiS, on more-or-less the same level as the others. That means the GM can't be completely detached, only running the processes (handling spotlight time, checking rules etc). Nor can he/she be the one everyone looks at to drive the game (have input on the fiction) - if so, he/she is pushing the ball uphill all alone, so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194047/#Comment_194047" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T00:27:21+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 12:27AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 12:54AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A longer than usual pause\u2026\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>This visual / perceptual analogy intrigues me.

So I guess it's a subconscious association of some sort. It doesn't feel like that in play.I understand what you describe. I believe the human mind is full of these kinds of synesthesia association. Mine is, at least.<br/><br/>Do you have any particular feeling while in play? (I don\u2019t think this is a potentially fruitful question, it\u2019s pure, unaltered, curiosity.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>are you playing in collaborative story mode when you have this golden ball phenomenon?

I've experienced it when playing Itras By as a GM, but that game has very heavy player authority. Sim, I don't know, hard to categorize.<br/>I am sorry, I do not understand your answer\u2026 I probably wasn\u2019t very clear. Let\u2019s try again. I suspect going golden is a kind of gaming ideal in collaborative story telling and I believe it feels like everything is natural, is happening by itself, the players are kind of channeling the story. I have near zero experience in this kind of play, so I may be very far out; please correct me when I am wrong. But I have much more experience with more traditional play where I have this ideal that feels like everything is happening naturally and we are channeling the characters \u2014 what is sometimes called immersion. I was asking if in your experience, the two feelings / ideals are akin. Is that clearer?<br/><br/><br/>About techniques deliberately aimed at reaching the golden state:<br/><br/>I am sure some players would be reticent, preferring the magic to simply happen, saying \u201cit\u2019s just a game\u201d, which means \u201cwhat you propose seems like work, I do not want to work in my leisure time\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too weird, I don\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s ridiculous / because I am not ready to make myself vulnerable in that way\u201d.<br/><br/>We might also, as others have undoubtedly already said elsewhere, benefit from improv techniques, and I am particularly thinking about warm-up exercises.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>That means the GM can't be completely detached, only running the processes (handling spotlight time, checking rules etc).</blockquote>I don\u2019t believe so. I think such a GM could help the other players going golden, but he won\u2019t get there himself. An \u201coutsider\u201d GM is leaving collaborative story creation himself, while facilitating it for others. Of course that might not be what you want, especially if you\u2019re the GM and want to go golden also. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Nor can he/she be the one everyone looks at to drive the game (have input on the fiction) - if so, he/she is pushing the ball uphill all alone, so to speak.</blockquote>Of course, because that would be, in practice, leaving collaborative story territory, which is necessary to reach (one of?) this territory\u2019s ideal.<br/><br/>I feel like I am at hairsplitting and going-to-tangents stage and not making any real contribution\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194048/#Comment_194048" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T00:43:53+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 12:43AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you're splitting hairs at all. I think we've just come to the stage where we understand what each other are saying, and agree to most points.<br/><br/>Now, "immersion" is a hard word - or rather, it's fluffy as a cloud. I wrote an article about it a few years ago - it's <a href="http://www.liveforum.dk/kp07book/lifelike_holter.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you'd like to read it; it's pretty short and to the point. Basically, when it comes to discussions like the one we're having, the word has so many different potential meanings that I think "immersion" needs to be defined for each discussion. Which you've done:\n<blockquote>it feels like everything is natural, is happening by itself, the players are kind of channeling the story. I have near zero experience in this kind of play, so I may be very far out; please correct me when I am wrong. But I have much more experience with more traditional play where I have this ideal that feels like everything is happening naturally and we are channeling the characters</blockquote>\nI know the feeling you're talking about when you're channeling the character. To me, it's slightly different from "going golden". When channeling a character, I feel like the character has his/her own life, and I'm just helping them speak through me. When "going golden", I don't quite feel like the story has its own life - that is, it has its own life, but I can see it in front of me, because the life it has comes from everyone contributing to it. It needs a breath of life from everyone, and is created in the space between us; it doesn't come fully-shaped from within.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8500/ritual-minded-people" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8500/ritual-minded-people" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8500/ritual-minded-people/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8500%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8500%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
