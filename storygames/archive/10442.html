When I got around to finishing the game and then remembered what happened, I was impressed to realize the memories I had did not involve the cards at all, but the characters and circumstances.<br/><br/>In my first game <i>my heart</i> was really easy to retreave.<br/><br/><b>Now I'm playing it for the second time:</b><br/><br/>This time it's become a lot more about experimentation for me; right now I'm trying to see what I can do with the ballroom.<br/><br/>Trying that has lead my to experiment a lot, I've already been to the bone yard (which was hard) and, right now, I'm trying to get a minor key back from the monster hoard stack... for which I'm trying to buy the lake (something tells me the lake is the way to get there) from the merchant king, who has it as an item for sale. My alternative is to bring the great wolf to him and see what happens then.<br/><br/><b>A little tip:</b><br/><br/>In order to "save my progress" I worked a little tick. I numbered the stacks on the game sheet (only the ones I have cards in) In that same order I stuffed the cards in said stacks into the book, one stack and then turn the page.<br/><br/>The rest of the deck I put in it's box, along with the out-of-game cards (jokers, the hollow lady and her heart) facing the oposite direction.<br/><br/>I hope I was clear... &gt;.&lt;<br/><br/><br/>You guys have to try this game, it's freaking awesome!</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232155/#Comment_232155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T22:26:34+00:00" title="September 13, 2009 10:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those of us who are not familiar with the game, what kind of a game is it?

This adds a tactical strategization element to the game, which is interesting.<br/><br/>You only read the card text when you draw the card, and even then certain sections are forbidden to read without having a certain companion or item by your side. As a result, you're constantly being introduced to that which is new, through play.<br/><br/>As a result... <b>[small spoiler in this paragraph]</b> I've heard mention of the wolf-blooded girl several times, but have yet to actually meet her, or learn anything about her, or to even read the "if the Wolf-Blooded Girl is your companion..." sections on those cards where I've seen her name appear. I'm super curious about who she is, what she'll do for me, and why she's ALL OVER THE FREAKIN' PLACE in these particular card descriptions. My next game, I'm going to be trying to locate her, as one of my top priorities.<br/><br/>It's fun. It's amazing how the game quickly trains you to build goals for yourself, in this weird fruitful void sort of way.<br/>That said, it's a playtest and there are issues. The "6" cards really frustrate me, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232482/#Comment_232482" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T12:30:42+00:00" title="September 15, 2009 12:30PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I REALLY need to find my copy of this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI picked it up at GPNW and while I know where the card deck is, I can't for the life of me locate the game.

I suppose there are some tricks to breaking those out, though.  Maybe buy a secret passage as an item and drop it in front of the hall or something.
