                    has anyone tried loosely scripting an rpg.  <br/>my friend and gm sometimes has players play traditional npcs, and gives us their motitations.  <br/>i was thinking about larry david's show  "curb your enthusiasm", in which he gives the actors an idex card sort of as a goal, it may have a line or two that needs to be said or some physical act that needs to happen, but they can take their time getting there, and surround it with much ad libbing.<br/>-nate                </div>

                            A lot of Amber play I've been involved in goes a lot like this.  Since there's a stable of characters who are generally very well known (within those who play) with a comparable degree of setting, it's not hard to do a game which entirely about handing out agendas and motivations and then just standing back.<br/><br/>In general, this is one of the best ways I know of to handle games over a certain size (such as living room LARPs, or even full scale LARPS), since it is probably the greatest return with the minimum amount of oversight.<br/><br/>It kicks ass.  <br/><br/>That said, a more structured version exists at a smaller scale with a lot of the more player-narration driven games.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            In Crime and Punishment you script out the key features of an episode of a procedural drama, and then get to go through and improv/act out the drama, using the scripted elements as goals and keys to moving the story forward.<br/><br/>Also, some of Luke's Burning Wheel demos do something like this, using beliefs and instincts in a tightly constructed situation to give players some pretty obvious goals to push on. The Sword, in particular, uses its combination of tight scripting and player interpretation to make some quickly explosive play.                        </div>

                            Nine Worlds Muses are precisely goals which must be fulfilled (or, possibly, lost). The act as motivations for all characters, PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/>For example, here is a suitable NPC goal (for Hecate, possibly): <br/><br/>Dethrone Artemis as Primarch of Luna.<br/><br/>Here's another: <br/><br/>Uncover the identity of the serial murderer haunting Venus Isle.                        </div>

                            For me it would kind of depend on how loose the script actually is; given a general description of what kind of person it is (ideally, one tailored to a character type I enjoy playing) and a general idea for what my "job" in the scene is going to be (e.g., "You want to get money and the promise of protection from the cop PC in exchange for telling him the location of the mobster's safe house"), I'm all set.  I'll have a blast, in fact.  We'll probably have insane amounts of fun with the conversation, and find excuses to pair that cop and that skeevy little stoolpigeon together again in the future.  That seems to be the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" approach you're talking about: there's a place that's already been decided we're going to go and all I have to do is steer my performance towards that place as entertainingly as possible.<br/><br/>But man, if you stick me with an overly-vague mandate or a poorly-matched NPC, I'm going to suck.  Just getting an index card with "You're greedy" on it isn't going to help me connect with the scene or the NPC: I'm going to end up splitting my efforts between figuring out where the scene should go and trying to play the NPC, and I'll probably fuck up both jobs royally.  And more to the point, if you want me to generate plans and long-term goals and the like, I'd just as soon do that for <i>my</i> character and leave the NPC wrangling to someone else.                        </div>
