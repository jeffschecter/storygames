I am working up a solo dungeon for folks to run through and us to all discuss. I need to find a damn scanner for the map.<br/><br/>1) Have you played in a dungeon crawl (this doesn't have to be underground) ?<br/>2) What aspects were fun for you?<br/>3) What aspects were not fun for you?<br/>4) Did your characters actions impact the the fiction in a meaningful way (no I am not going to define meaningful)?<br/>5) If it existed did the Setting/Color dictate the type of character you played, have any effect on Positioning and Currency within the game, and/or what the character could do? <br/><br/>Thanks!!!<br/><br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189855/#Comment_189855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T15:12:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  3:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Played in only a handful, ran hundreds<br/>2) We'll stick to the few times I've actually played. In those cases, I found the funnest parts to be finding creative solutions to problems, be they combat or otherwise. I find that I'd much rather be presented with a seemingly impossible challenge and have to find a way around it than just run through everything with no challenge.<br/>3) Repetition is bad. Entering another empty room with a few enemies who do nothing of particular interest then killing them and going to the next room thats a bit bigger with slightly different enemies, etc. is bad. <br/>4) Usually not, although I have ran through maybe two or three dungeons that were really cool in that when you did something in one room, the rest of the rooms reacted, which caused the entire scenario to shift, which I would call impacted the fiction, at least as far as dungeons go.<br/>5) All the times I've gone dungeoneering, it was basically "play whatever character then go into a dungeon and kill things" so nope, not at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189860/#Comment_189860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T16:49:46+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  4:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Answering for myself <br/><br/>1) Have you played in a dungeon crawl (this doesn't have to be underground) ? Yes<br/>2) What aspects were fun for you? Exploring arround, Fighting Interesting Fights, Discovering Fantastic Stuff, Completing Objectives<br/>3) What aspects were not fun for you? Tedious Bits (How long did it take to jog threw that 4.3 mile tunnel, having to set up SOP if the GM is the type to ding us for that, having to set up a SOP if the group is anal retentive like that, Incomplete or clashing content and colour, a crashed starship is appropiate if that is what the module is about, its not appropiate as per Indiana Jones 4, etc)<br/>4) Did your characters actions impact the the fiction in a meaningful way (no I am not going to define meaningful)? I think so, They may not have rewritten the universes history or slept with their mother or done some angsty brooding, but I play/run in games where the fiction is focused on the players. Going left or right matters, living or dying matters, etc. <br/>5) If it existed did the Setting/Color dictate the type of character you played, have any effect on Positioning and Currency within the game, and/or what the character could do? Yes, Little to None, and Little to none.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189874/#Comment_189874" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T21:37:35+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  9:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad that you're doing this.

Exploration, not knowing what's around the next corner, trying to anticipate what might be around the next corner<br/>3. Reptitive monster bashing<br/>4. Yes and no. For me, Keep on the Borderlands is the prototype. Rooms are largely self-contained, but with touchpoints where you arctions can ripple through the dungeon.<br/>5. Yes, very much. I always like to play a character who fits the setting, but has some contrasting elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189879/#Comment_189879" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T21:58:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  9:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br/><br/>  Cool.

Not very much, though.<br/><br/><b>2) What aspects were fun for you?</b><br/><br/>Not much. Depends on what we consider "dungeon crawling", but it's likely that the positive aspects in my dungeon crawl actual play experience have come from either running them or some aspect of the game that had nothing to do with the crawl itself.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, though, I'd say that it'd be cool to get to play a dungeon that felt real. There's some potential in the underground environment for a sort of pretentious horror fantasy atmosphere, but I've yet to see anything apart from routine monster-bashing emerge when I've played in other people's dungeons. Of course I think that my own efforts are much more entertaining.<br/><br/><b>3) What aspects were not fun for you?</b><br/><br/>Limits of the genre. Every time I've played dungeon crawls, I've felt terribly constrained by the hard-coded assumptions of how I'm supposed to do things. These can range from expecting that I engage all enemies in direct combat the moment the GM declares them to forbidding advance scouting due to the need to keep the party together. All sorts of annoying shit that seems to have nothing to do with an open-mindedly imagining the dungeon environment and playing with the fiction as opposed to rules.<br/><br/>Combat systems are also annoying, dungeon crawls always seem to run on some sort of D&amp;D clone systems with combat rounds, ablative defenses and little tactical opportunity. Boring.<br/><br/><b>4) Did your characters actions impact the the fiction in a meaningful way (no I am not going to define meaningful)?</b><br/><br/>I'd have to say no for the most part. Of course it might be that I've just played with boring GMs, but mostly it seems that the best I can do is keep my own character alive by being a horrible pain in the ass for everybody else involved.<br/><br/><b>5) If it existed did the Setting/Color dictate the type of character you played, have any effect on Positioning and Currency within the game, and/or what the character could do?</b><br/><br/>Not much. Very annoying, that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
