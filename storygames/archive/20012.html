The Coup, The Resistance, Nosferatu</i>, etc. and I've come up with this design.<br/><br/>It's different because roles are open, not secret: also, there are no eliminations until the very end of the game. I'm looking for feedback on the design, e.g. do you think the structure of the game and the balance of roles would work? I'm also happy to hear any more suggestions for roles that could be added.\ufeff<br/><br/>Get the Compound pdf <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1iTjRUomaBXa3ZKbVB6alRyR2M/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/><b>Update</b>: The game has been tweaked several times over the past 24 hours, to address specific issues and improve the playability, so check the link again to make sure you have the latest draft.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
