I have thoughts on these I'll get around to posting, and I'm sure you all have some thoughts on it too.<br/>\n<h2>Topic A: Fanmail</h2>\n<blockquote><cite>A1</cite>Spring flowers beckon<br/>Dice clatter on the tables,<br/>Camp Nerdly at last.<br/>- Tony LB</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A2</cite>I like the shape of Jason Morningstar's head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A3</cite>Talent show = Awesome. Jason Morningstar + Game = Better! Google for Game Designers = Fantastic! </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A4</cite>An official "Draw the Organizer" or art thing Contest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A5</cite>You guys did an awesome job. Thanks for letting us "outsiders" come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A6</cite>Remi was particularly awesome &amp; helpful, he was open, friendly, and available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A7</cite>Jason Morningstar is a dirty hippie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A8</cite>Okay, all kidding aside: Jason, Steve, Remi, Brand, Mo, Lisa, Erid, etc etc etc =&gt; awesome! For those who organized: Thank you for making such a fun, funny, playful, friendly event.You worked your asses off to make it great for all of us. And it was! Many, many new friends: De Leare (sp?) &amp; Kat, Kye, Mo, Brand. W00t!</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A9</cite>Overall a very positive experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>A10</cite>At the beginning, Jason Morningstar told everyone to bring the awesome, and they totally did. I'm worn out from all the sheer radness. Next Nerdly needs to be closer to Canada. This Rocked! -Anna</blockquote>\n<h2>Topic B: To Bring</h2>\n<blockquote><cite>B1</cite>A chainsaw</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B2</cite>Add to list of "bring your own" a bed sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B3</cite>Feedback box needs pen with string attached. And possibly a more attractive box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B4</cite>More Whiteboards (DY)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B5</cite>Don't forget the Whos in What Game Stuff </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B6</cite>DY note to self: bring a hatchet, matches/lighter, newspaper, and a bow saw to make fires &amp; wood easier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>B7</cite>Bring a Gong</blockquote>\n<h2>Topic C: Friday Evening</h2>\n<blockquote><cite>C1</cite>Somewhat more explicit instructions for what to do when you get to the park</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>C2</cite>First night first slot games should be pickup ice-breaking games only. Games should all be floating but announced beforehand (Mark C.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>C3</cite>Plan for a Friday 'Meet &amp; Greet' dinner, but slap Sunday lunch - most everyone is done by that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>C4</cite>Given varying levels of social adroitness in the campers, as well as varying degrees of previous association between them, it's no surprise that the population (most strikingly at meal times) might rapidly stratify into the more and less "popular" groups. So antithetical does this seem to the camp's purpose that there can be no effort spared towards its eradication. Perhaps we might start with having some kind of opening ceremonies mixer on Friday evening rather than leaping directly (in practice, gradually) into the gaming?</blockquote>\n...continued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67049/#Comment_67049" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T05:15:55+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  5:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2007 5:20AM by Dave Younce.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h2>Topic <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> Where organizers can do more</h2>\n<blockquote><cite>D1</cite>Communicate chore responsibilities more clearly &amp; define them, maybe have a time &amp; rally point.

(Make some longer?)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>E2</cite>I really hated the schedule &amp; time blocking as it led to scrambling &amp; folks leaving in the middle of games.

That means no kids please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F2</cite>Suggestion: If kids above carrying/toddling age (5-14 yrs?) participate in Nerdly, have a designated track of games/activities for them, with designated (volunteer?) adults willing to supervise. (Adult areas = ADULT AREAS). Maybe Fred Wolke could do the kids' program/supervision, since its important to him? NOT a personal attack on Fred W. - he could be good at it &amp; might feel more included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F3</cite>I love Camp Nerdly, but I wish it was either only for adults, or kids had their own space and were not allowed to play any of the adult games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F4</cite>I'd like the adult-only area to be more enforceable. I would like to suggest that either young toddlers or older (16+) kids be preferred. Grade school and tweenies not be preferred. </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F5</cite>I was very dissapointed by the lack of enforcement of _adult-only_ space. This was supposed to be (I thought) a grown-up vacation, but often I felt like the presence of children intruded on my play-space. If they could have their own kid-only activities that would help end the friction of younger kids always trying to intrude on adult games. Even if the parent gives them permission, I don't feel it is fair to those adults trying to run &amp;/or enjoy their games. I am not trying to be anti-kid, but their presence made me uncomfortable and it didn't seem like the right kind of event to bring kids to. I would _very much_ prefer this be an age 16+ event (or higher).</blockquote>\n<h2>Topic G: Future Swag</h2>\n<blockquote><cite>G1</cite>Playing Cards! Patches/Buttons!

Putting such a board in the Mess Hall where people could read it and post would help with pickup games and floating games, as well as camp announcements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSample scenario:  I see that I have a block of time on Saturday afternoon with no scheduled activity and decide I want to run a board game.  I tack an index card on the board (tearing the bottom half to provide tear-away player "tickets") and state where and when I'll run the game.

If someone volunteers to be a fun integration specialist at CN for a time-slot, we could give them a funny hat or badge, and tell them, "Hang out in the mess hall and engage people, and be ready to facilitate a fun activity for two to six people at any time."

I admit these "weaknesses" up front by way of saying that I am not concerned about them whatsoever.<br/><br/>Everyone would get a piece of paper with every person at nerdly on it.  Scores work as follows.<br/><br/>You get 1 point for every game you participated in where the game is one you've played before.<br/><br/>You get 3 points for every game you participated in where the game is NOT one you've played before.  (New experience bonus!)<br/><br/>You get 1 point for every game you organize and run (whether that's as the GM or facilitator or dude with the supplies -- whatever).  This is in addition to the point you get for participating in a game you've played before.<br/><br/>You get 1 point for every person who you've met before that you get to sit down with and game with/talk with at length.<br/><br/>You get 3 points for every person who you HAVEN'T met before (in person) that you get to sit down with and game with or talk with at length.  (New friends bonus!)<br/><br/>Note that the new game experience and new friend experience point system means that even if you're someone who's not an extrovert/reach-out-er, so long as several someone elses are, you'll still get the benefit of the conversation/gaming in terms of the points you score.  This also encourages folks to directly observe and learn the names of other folks at Nerdly -- something which I definitely need help with as well.  I like the idea of a game providing social incentive.  It's also weighted so that someone who's never made it to an event where they get to meet all the folks in the "scene" is way more likely to win than someone who's been around a while.  I like this.<br/><br/>At any rate, these scores would get tallied probably at breakfast on Sunday, with the highest scores yielding selections from a prize pool populated by donated materials, be it from attending publishers (like me -- I could easily toss a copy of an Evil Hat game into the pool) or some of the items still around from the trade bazaar, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67192/#Comment_67192" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T08:52:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  8:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a long time since I was at summer camp, but one of the things I remember a lot of was police whistles and shouting.  \n<blockquote>TWWWWWEEE! <br/><br/>Alright, listen up, owlbears!

Recess is only slightly larger than Nerdly (80 people) and it seems to work for that size group. Dreamation is quite a bit larger. We used to allow everyone to register for the entire day and it wasn't bad at all. We found registering multiple times allowed for more talking, more socializing, and more spontaneity. I don't think it would work past a certain number of people. And it may not be the best answer for Nerdly. I definitely advocate experimenting and I think either way will rock!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67228/#Comment_67228" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T09:49:19+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  9:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the ride up Terry, Alexander and I were slightly saddened by the lack of alcohol but by the end, we completely forgot about it.

I ended up brutally overbooked, never quite sure who was supposed to be in which game, and constantly having to decide between games that I wanted to be in that I thought were at different times but ended up being all run at the same time. (Part of this is my fault, as I was out of town and away from computers for the last week before, and thus didn't get to see the final schedule.) So many of the above ideas about how to fix that issue sound both good and necessary to me.<br/><br/>Also, as part of that, I'm very much a quality over quantity kinda guy. I'd like a system in which folks can plan games for how long they honestly think the game should run to get maximum impact, rather than trying to stuff games into preset time slots. I know it does add a slight layer of complexity and that it may end up with points at which we are not (gasp!) involved in a game every second of the day, but honest to God, I can't stand it when a game that was just starting to get good has to be called because the 3 hour block that the game never should have been in is now over and everyone has to run to their next game. <br/><br/>Finally, I'd be a meet-n-greet type dork.

Sure, I focused on longer games, cause that's me, but shorter games are good too. (Though its worth noting that the awesome Dead of Night game I was in was only about 2 hours long.) Its all about making the slot work for the game you're playing. If you want 6 hours you should be able to book 6 hours. If you want 1 and no more, you should be able to do 1 and no more. <br/><br/>For me its not about "what time makes the best game in all situations" and more about the fact that one size doesn't fit all. <br/><br/>Plus, if we have long games and short games the two together make nifty blocks to play the "construct schedules" game with. And your idea about 2 hour slots booked across sounds like a pretty easy way to make that go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67319/#Comment_67319" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T11:17:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 11:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two hour slots with the ability to book more than one is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67329/#Comment_67329" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T11:25:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 11:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2007 11:26AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Iskander</cite>What<i>"10pm quiet time"</i>rule?

Very smart.  I should have thought of that.<br/><br/>Quiet time: Ditto on the "crap, we had a quiet time rule?" thing.<br/><br/>3 hrs vs. 4 hours: Honestly, I'd like both, and I think it'd be pretty easy to do.  Structure each day as <br/>- breakfast (8-9), <br/>- 3 hour slot (9-12),<br/>- lunch (12-1), <br/>- 4 hour slot (1-5), <br/>- dinner (at 5pm instead of 4pm; I found 4pm to be *freakishly* early in the day to be having the last meal of it -- at home a 7pm dinner is early, for me, so I don't feel like I'm pushing this very far)<br/>- 3 hour slot (6pm-9pm)<br/>- flex hour slot (9:30pm until whenever).<br/><br/>Folks who don't want 4 hours of gaming can make sure they put 3 hour games in the 4-hour slot, and then can be available to start dinner prep early!  The 3-hour slots are there to keep the evening slot at a reasonable time, but still making sure folks can see as many games as possible in a day.<br/><br/>I do think 4 hour slots are friendlier to games that have a setup phase (i.e., series creation, setting creation, character creation) followed by play, but 3 hour slots are good for swing-for-the-fences, play-right-now games.  Mine was more the former, so I felt a little trapped by the 3 hour structure.  Willing to accommodate it -- just trapped. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Finally - One thing I would have liked to know about beforehand (and it's possible I didn't read enough to have caught it) is that there are only two damn showers per gender, hot water is scarce, and shower curtains few and far between.

No doubt about it. And, of course, addressing that at future events is a must-do. But, two things: <br/>1) What Krista's describing shouldn't have happened - if you just sat down at that table on a whim, and somebody comes along who says they signed up for the spot, the proper thing to do is give them your spot. <br/>2) If you're running an event, and you know there's a page on the internet that tells you who is interested in your event, it's in your interest to print that page out yourself or at least have a pretty good mental list of who you should connect with about that event.  Camp Nerdly isn't a con, its a self-organized event with some facilitators, and the ultimately responsible party for your fun is you. <br/><br/>So there was clearly a communication gap between what I thought: "As somebody who can fearlessly edit the wiki, I'll put a draft schedule together for everyone's use and benefit, and people will be responsible for administering their own events, including knowing who is in them", and what several (or maybe all) attendees thought: "Oh, the organizers put together a schedule, so its just like a con; I can expect that the organizers will provide me a list of who is in my game."  <br/><br/>I guess that communication gap was about 80% my fault for not stating my point of view, and about 20% everyone else's fault for never asking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67469/#Comment_67469" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T20:42:06+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  8:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I noticed during the event was that many people missed the "bring your own plate, cup, and utensils" bit, or just plain forgot their mess kit back at the cabin.

Cry me a river, Kitkowski.  Here's the deal:  We checked the seasonal round and picked a good date and NPS arbitrarily moved us a week earlier.  Honestly, it's going to be hit and miss any time of the year.  Want to do it in late August?  Either 110 degress with plagues of mosquitoes, or a hurricane. \n<blockquote>I was much impressed with the folding bowls I saw in evidence at camp.</blockquote>\nThey are the bees knees.  The bowl is most practical, the cup least practical.  You can use them as cutting boards, too.  I've had mine for a year, use the bowl every day, and it hasn't failed yet.\n<blockquote>Boo hoo, I didn't know who was supposed to be in my game</blockquote>\nYeah, this bit me, too.  I'm not sure what I thought was going to happen, but we didn't communicate our expectations very well and this was a piece of organization that nobody did.  That's a self-organizing event for you!
