<p>So like I've been thinking about a certain behavior pattern I've been observing with gamers. It's pretty visible in forums like RPGnet, and I spent a few years watching it at my college gaming club, too.</p>
<p>Namely, there are games we like a lot - like my friend J and old D&amp;D (I have forgotten the edition), or myself and Weapons of the Gods, or Jonathan and Nobilis.</p>
<p>But of course, there are parts we don't like, and react to really negatively. Almost violently. Like, every time I hit a mention of "Kung Fu Marvels" in WotG I have to stop myself from closing the book in disgust. I've come close to crossing bits out of the book and pasting in Post-its with less distasteful text. (Jon, I'm totally curious about your gripes, we should discuss them some time.)</p>
<p>What's up with that?</p>
<p>Somehow it seems diffused in the design community, though.</p>
<p>What's up with <em>that?</em></p>

                            Well, what do you mean by disgust up there?  What part of the Kung Fu Marvels does that to you?<br/><br/>As for me... ... Not so much. I tried to think of something I didn't like and had a "bad reaction to" in a book I otherwise liked, but couldn't think of anything.  And if I had a lukewarm or no reaction to the game, I quickly sold it on eBay or RPGNet.<br/><br/>So I'm trying to understand the negativity- Is it because they're written poorly, or because they're something sexist/racist in there, or what?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>It's because I can't use them, Andy - they're part of the kung fu / optimisation minigame, and basically the entire mechanic is "Make up a mechanical effect and ask the GM how difficult it is (a skill roll and chi expenditure) to do it, stretching the skills you have in some kung fu style."</p>
<p>That is just so violently incompatible with the kung fu that I find it utterly unpalatable. In theory, the only thing preventing a Blizzard Fist user from setting someone on fire with his ice breath is my fiat, and I don't want to be made to use fiat when we already have a framework of what the styles do and look like that the system <em>completely fails to use.</em></p>
<p>It boils dows to two things in my case, a strong distaste for fiat in optimisation games, and complete stupefaction at the design choice that happened there.</p>

                            Yeah, I think it happens because I get such a stong sense of what certain games are trying to do, and want to see them succeed, but then I come across things that make me ask "What the heck is THAT doing there?" or "Why isn't that mechanic like 20X stronger and underlined 5 times?"  It's like I have some sort of weird design dissonance with the author, when they seem, from my perspective, to be shooting a really awesome game in the foot, turning it into merely a really good game.  Like "Hello, Motivation mechanics from <i>Exalted 2</i>?  Why don't you have any teeth?  Hello, <i>Nobilis</i> Bonds system?  Why does everyone ignore you?  Hello lots of things about <i>Continuum</i>?  Why are you so impossible to run?"<br/><br/>You love the game, but you are frustrated with bits of them that just don't fly.                        </div>

<p>Let me point out, however, that I've also seen this syndrome with people who are absolutely, 100% totally sure that they know what a game is trying to do ... and they are absolutely, 100% wrong.</p>
<p>Like, for the longest time I battered my head against <em>Champions</em> because I was totally, 100% certain that the game was trying to lead up to the moment when all of a hero's moral issues come together and give him power that he could never otherwise access.  And so I'd sit there and rail that the Psychological Limitations rules were too unsubtle, and that the Pushing rules were hobbled, and all of that was because I was <em>dead wrong</em> about what the system was doing.  But I couldn't see that.</p>
<p>Not saying that's your issue (indeed, I have the same question as you about the Nobilis <em>Bonds</em> system) just pointing out that this type of thing can evolve in different ways.</p>

<i>and complete stupefaction at the design choice that happened there.</i><br/><br/>In my head, I just imagine that the designer ran out of steam.  I see them working and working, and then they just can't quite go anymore, but they still feel driven to address one last issue.  So, they wave their hands vigorously as to how they might, kinda sorta, start to address it with the mechanics so far and call it a day.<br/><br/><i>Somehow it seems diffused in the design community, though.</i><br/><br/>I suspect because that people who actually produce stuff are more keenly aware of the 'real' sweat that goes into a project, as well as the temptations and necessities that demand somethings just not quite be done as well.  And, of course, because designers see gaps in design as challenges that they can solve.  When you don't have a fix-it mentality, a hole is just something that lets all the rain in.<br/><br/><i>Let me point out, however, that I've also seen this syndrome with people who are absolutely, 100% totally sure that they know what a game is trying to do ... and they are absolutely, 100% wrong.</i><br/><br/>Which probably has something to do with the designer-user conflict--as a user, we just want the game to do what we want.  As a designer, we are willing to concede that we might need to make the system that does what we want.<br/><br/>I suspect that game hacking is so common among gamers because of the frustration with what the rules don't do, of how they fail to meet the expectations we (rightly or wrongly) put upon them.                        </div>

                            I see this as a Book versus Game issue.  We read the book and we are inspired by parts of it to play a game.  Maybe we play that game, based on the parts we like.  Maybe we play it for a month or two.  And then we go back and reread the book and we wonder what the hell <em>this</em> part is doing here, since the game that we have in our heads and the game that we've so enjoyed playing has absolutely nothing to do with <em>this</em>.<br/><br/>In the end, I think it's a moot point.  Did you have fun playing the game?  Then why do you care that there's a section in the book that you did not use?                        </div>
