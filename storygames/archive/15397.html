Upon looking for resources to help in my game design process, I've decided to come to SG!. I have been lurking these boards for years though!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the game I'm creating I want to encourage a different style of play. I want my game to mimic the novels I read or the movies I watch. I want epic stories where the characters are there for a reason. I will have two levels to my game. One level allows players to collaboratively develop the setting and plot (and develop them throughout play). The other level allows the players to roleplay a character in this story. Im hoping to develop a deeper connection between the characters themselves and the characters and the setting/plot they are in. More focused on the overall story than the individual battles within. I have liberally borrowed mechanics from other games, but I have no intentions of publishing for commercial use. The primary goal of the entire game is Simplicity. It should be on the level of Microlite d20. Its no Risus, but its no Rolemaster either!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rules:<br/>\n<br/>\nStory<br/>\nAUTHORITY<br/>\nEach player begins with 25 story points and gains 5 after each encounter. Story points are used for bidding or purchasing.<br/>\n\u2022 Bidding:<br/>\nStep 1: Players secretly wager a number of points. <br/>\nStep 2: Player\u2019s bids are revealed.<br/>\nStep 3: Winner loses wagered story points, but gains authority over creating one plot element, framing the upcoming scene, or winning the challenge.<br/>\n\u2022 Purchasing:<br/>\nStep 1: Following scene framing, players take turns introducing components or facts into the scene one at a time, each component or fact costing one story point.<br/>\nStep 2: Once the table is content with the scene and all its components and facts, play recurs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPLOT CARDS<br/>\nTo construct the main plot, players bid for authority to create elements (situation, goal, opponent, and disaster). Each element is bid on separately. To construct a personal plot or side quest, the player introducing the plot creates all elements and requires no expenditure of story points. A character may have up to two personal plots at a time and may create these at any time. Side quests may be created at any time, but cost 3 Story Points to introduce. Side Quests are associated with an extra, event, or location that grants them.<br/>\n<br/>\nElements: [Character/s] is in [Situation] and must accomplish [Goal]. Can [Character/s] defeat [Opponent] when [Disaster] happens?<br/>\n\u2022 Situation (The change, event, trouble, danger that forces protagonist to act) <br/>\n\u2022 Goal (The specific thing that the protagonist/s sets out to achieve) <br/>\n\u2022 Opponent (What stands between the protagonist/s and the goal) <br/>\n\u2022 Disaster (The consequences of failure)<br/>\n<br/>\nMilestones: <br/>\nEach encounter that concludes favorably and progresses towards the achievement of a Plot Card is considered a milestone; representing gaining a clue, having a revelation, or completing part of a process. Milestones may be removed in the occurrence of a scene ending in a drawback or failure; representing losing progress, missing opportunities, or discovering a plot twist. The target number of milestones must be met or exceeded for the goal to be resolved. Main Plots have 7 milestones, Personal Plots have 5, and Side Quests have 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSCENE FRAMING<br/>\nTo construct a scene, players bid for authority. Authority allows four choices:<br/>\n1. Scene Type: Encounter or Exploration;<br/>\n2. Scene setting (establish location and set the time);<br/>\n3. If Encounter scene, which plot card to advance;<br/>\n4. If Encounter scene, scene\u2019s objective: possession or relief from:  allies, adversaries, events, locations, or items and information. Once the scene\u2019s objective is met, the scene ends. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers may then take turns purchasing components and facts or adding color. Components include characters, items, and conditions. Facts include story change devices (discoveries and revelations) that will be exposed during the scene, events (political or natural) occurring during the scene, and potential contests. Color is any descriptive feature added to the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nCosts: Heroes (1), Companions (2), Followers (3 for group of 5), Villain (3), Henchman (2), Minions (1 for group of 5), Gear (equals purchase difficulty), Conditions (equals difficulty), all Facts (equals difficulty), Color (free)<br/>\n<br/>\nChallenges: Disputing the introduction of a component or fact. All players may pool story points in order to support an introduced component or fact or to challenge the introduction. Whichever side wins the bid, decides whether or not the component or fact is actually introduced. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUCTURED PLOT MODEL<br/>\n1. Endanger the Characters<br/>\n2. Reveal the True Danger<br/>\n3. The Pursuit Encounters Complications<br/>\n4. Certain Doom<br/>\n5. The Twist<br/>\n6. Final Showdown<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions:<br/>\nAuthority<br/>\n1. How many points should Antagonists get compared to Protagonists (Since there is an Unequal Number on each side, I believe there should be an Unequal Power to compensate)?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlot Cards<br/>\n2. Am I missing anything else that should be considered when framing a plot, in terms of elements?<br/>\n3. In general, how what are your impressions of plot cards (main, personal, and side) and milestones?<br/>\n<br/>\nScene Framing<br/>\n4. Am I missing anything else that should be considered when framing a scene?<br/>\n5. Does the suggested story point cost for introducing conditions (environmental hazards, etc), plot revelations, and events (political or natural events) seem fair (purchasing cost equal to difficulty for characters in scene to overcome; which may be out of place for plot revelations...thoughts?)?<br/>\n6. How do you feel about this Challenge system?:<br/>\n<br/>\nChallenges: Disputing the introduction of a component or fact. All players may pool story points in order to support an introduced component or fact or to challenge the introduction. Whichever side wins the bid, decides whether or not the component or fact is actually introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nStructured Plot Model<br/>\n7. I need to expand the structured plot model by adding one more scene type for the seven milestones of the main plot. What should I add and where?<br/>\n8. Which scenes from the structured model should be used for personal plots (need 5 scenes) and the side quests (need 3 scenes). My proposal:<br/>\nPersonal Plots: scenes 1,2,3,4,6<br/>\nSide Quests: scenes 1, 4, 6 <br/>\n<br/>\nAny other questions, comments?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
