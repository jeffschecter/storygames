I interpret this in a few ways, and can't figure out how to actually use this move 'correctly'.<br/><br/>Option 1:<br/>A dangerous area would be one that might have a trap, (or even something trap-like, like falling boulders in a gorge for instance)... and would usually be a place you could survey in the immediate sense ie. search a room, a stretch of corridor, an ominous doorway or painting.... <br/>Since the move is only triggered in a dangerous area, that means that if you search for traps and there isn't any, then there is no need to roll, the GM says, 'nope you found none', whereas if there is traps, you would roll and on a 6- you triggered it (or something like that) and 7+ you spend hold.<br/><br/>Option 2:<br/>A dangerous area specifically refers to the entire dungeon, swamp, evil necromancers castle etc.... and basically it allows you to roll in advance of searching for traps to generate hold that you then spend as you wander around the dungeon/place....  Basically this means that a 6- would generate ad hoc dangers, such as a trap etc, and this means that the act of searching for the trap might in fact create more traps.  <br/><br/>Option 3<br/>Something else completely.....<br/><br/>So i guess my question is what does DWorld mean when it says 'dangerous area'?  Can you roll in advance and wander around with the hold to spend as you see fit, or is an area more like a stretch of tunnel, and lastly, if the area is a stretch of tunnel does that mean that a safe area (trap's wise) would automatically mean not to roll?<br/><br/>thanks for your help.  If i'm way off, just let me know.  I'm familiar with the system, but my hang up is with the wording, and also how it relates to discern realities as well, since in theory you could find a trap using that move too (although if you go with option 1, the trap expert move is better)<br/><br/>Thanks for any and all Dworld wisdom.<br/><br/>Oliver.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435227/#Comment_435227" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T12:49:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2014 12:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 2:29PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use option 3, which is sorta like option 2.

A Location.<br/><br/>It sounds like maybe you are assuming the map exists before the game.  It doesn't have to.  The trap doesn't necessarily exist in the fiction until the fiction demands it.  This could be due to a hard move, for instance.  Think like a movie or TV show about dungeon crawlers: the writers of such scripts never bother to draw a map.  So why should we?

Yet the answer you're looking for is in three of the principles for me:<br/><br/>-Draw maps, leave blanks<br/>-Be a fan of the characters<br/>-Think dangerous<br/><br/>So, describe the dungeon, if players think there is a trap, make them roll, add a trap there and let the trap expert do his work. If not, describe how something from that places looks off for the player and let her decide if she uses her trap expert move or something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435235/#Comment_435235" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T13:26:25+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  1:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose you could run it as a Schroedinger's Trap thing, but the questions suggest otherwise. "Is there a trap here?" is literally the first question. I think it's honestly something you have to decide on the spot when the player starts looking, and you decide based on whether it makes sense in the situation. And probably sway your results towards the positive if there's doubt. <br/><br/>Or you could pre-plan it to a degree. "Play to find out" is 100% compatible with a certain amount of structure. You build up things you know to be there, and then find out what happens to them. Draw those maps, and know that there's some places set up with traps. Be open for players to ask about things you didn't think of, though.<br/><br/>If you search for traps in a dangerous area with no traps, then it's on you to ask the first question. The move grants you reassurance in that case: you can be guaranteed that not only do you not notice any traps, but that's because you looked well enough to rule out traps. That reassurance isn't just a whiff; it's a guarantee of safety. (Very important in trap-heavy dungeons! Imagine being able to ask "Is there a trap here? If so, what activates it?" in Tomb of Horrors!)<br/><br/>And don't forget the third question: "What else is hidden here?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435236/#Comment_435236" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T13:49:23+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  1:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 1:54PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your replies that was fast!!!!<br/><br/>You are all saying different things... Not nescessarily completely contradictory things, but things that are very different for sure.<br/><br/>My questions:<br/><br/>-ASIF, I am not saying that i draw the whole dungeon beforehand, what i am asking is how do you know if there is a trap there?  Do what the fiction demands?  How do you apply this principal in this case, in laymens terms?   <br/><br/>- further to the above... Why search for a trap that can only exist if you search?  That isn't how players are typically programmed, other than the spend which grants you 'what else is here' you have no reason to search for traps if there can be no trap that exists before the player rolls.  Moves like spout lore and discern realities give you an insentive to roll, not so for trap expert... you are searching for an existant trap, if not, why roll to create one?<br/><br/>-The key phrase to me is 'dangeour area', why write this?  It occurred to me that the idea was to avoid the dumb situation where the theif has to roll every ten feet down the corridor.  If there is nothing there you say there is nothing there (do what prep demands, do what fiction demands) don't waste their time....  this makes it more useful than discern realities, the risk is that you are walking into a trap if you fail the roll.<br/><br/>-Warrior monk says that the area becomes dangerous due to a 6- on discern realities, i haven't read that anywhere, and i was wondering if that was a suggestion, a way to do it, or the way to do it.  Using this method, the incentive is that a 10+ is rolled on discern realities, a 6- then prompts the theif to try to undo the last roll.  Is that what you meant when you wrote this?<br/><br/>I don't mean to disagree i am questioning these posts more to question myself, becuase i am pretty confused with this. <br/><br/>Oliver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435238/#Comment_435238" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T13:59:37+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  1:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you search for traps in a dangerous area with no traps, then it's on you to ask the first question.

On a success, as CarpeGuitarrem says. On a failure, they have probably wasted some time, and you can make a hard move related to that.<br/><br/>In response to the option 1 or option 2 question, I think others have stated before that in DW moves are quite flexible in terms of "zoom" (time and distance). You can say a particular hack &amp; slash roll represents 10 seconds, minutes of trading blows, or perhaps even more, so similarly you could say a roll of discern realities/trap expert covers a whole castle/dungeon. I guess it depends on how much time do you/the players want to devote to that part of the story.<br/>But it's not a roll in advance. The roll covers the entire castle because and if the character is actively looking for traps while he goes through it. If he gets wounded on room 4 and can't continue to search for them, he shouldn't be able to spend the hold anymore (similar to defend: if you stop defending that guy/girl, you lose the hold).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435239/#Comment_435239" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T14:02:20+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  2:02PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 2:12PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">@cupbearer11</a> - I think the fact that our answers are slightly different has a lot to do with the flexibility of the game.  You will see different MCs' personal styles show up in play.  <br/><br/>To your question: "how do you know if there is a trap there?"  Again, it depends.  Sometimes you might just have an area on a pre-drawn map that says "Dangerous!"  You can figure out exactly <i>why</i> when you get there.  Sometimes it's a custom move you made up for the dungeon itself - in that case you wait til a good Hard Move and play it.  Sometimes I even create small random tables similar to "wandering monster tables" and make a Dungeon Move called "Roll on the Table".  And such a table might include the word "trap" (or specific sorts of traps).<br/><br/>And, as <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a> implies, sometimes you actually might have a specific idea for a very cool trap in a particular place.  As long as you're not too railroady about it, there's nothing "wrong" with knowing that ahead of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435240/#Comment_435240" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T14:09:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  2:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CarpeGuitarrem:<br/><br/>Fair enough.

You control that principle by doing the sort of prep, and the amount of prep, that you want (or have time for) <i>for this particular session</i>.  <br/><br/>That last italicized bit is important.  Your prep (and the amount of it) may differ greatly from session to session.  Mine certainly does.  Like I said, sometimes I have a random table.  But sometimes I don't.  Sometimes I have a one-page dungeon I downloaded, hey why not?

There are lots of sorts of danger.  So that sides with option 2.  But sometimes you actually might have a trap you know is there or you might write "Here there be traps" on a pre-drawn map, which sides with option 1. <br/><br/>I keep saying words like "necessarily" and "sometimes".  That's not tactical indecision.  It's situational flexibility.  It depends on your prep and your style.<br/><br/>1 sub 1: Because sometimes the PCs know the danger is a trap, but sometimes they only know it's dangerous, and sometimes they don't know at all.  Only the MC knows, and even that is a <i>maybe</i>.<br/>1 sub 2: I define the area smaller.<br/>1 sub 3: How could that happen?  If they aren't checking, why would they roll?<br/><br/>2 sub 1: Narrative Arc.<br/>2 sub 2: "Show signs of an approaching threat"\ufeff.  Say things like "well, in the last ten minutes you've found nothing... <i>and nothing has found you.</i>" I.e., Build the suspense and paranoia, making it seem difficult and risky to stop every ten feet.  If they <i>do</i> stop every ten feet to make a roll, they're probably gonna generate some fails, which means you get to stack up your moves and play em!  The PCs will learn pretty quick to differentiate between <i>discerning</i> and <i>searching.</i><br/><br/>From the RAW:<br/><b>Exploit your prep:</b> "At times you\u2019ll know something the players don\u2019t yet know. You can use that knowledge to help you make moves." - notice this doesn't assume how much prep you did.  Because it varies.  It just says "at times".<br/><b>Begin and end with the fiction.</b> - this means don't just say "no."  Make them see, hear, smell and feel the scary situation they're in.<br/><b>Think offscreen too.</b> - <i>What is that weird sound?

Only the MC knows, and even that is a maybe."</b><br/>Roll when you survey a dangerous area.  To me that means if they get to roll at all they are learning something (it is dangerous here in this area).  In your interpretation the area is limited, and i would agree.  But this creates an interesting problem:<br/>  EX.  Thief opens door, empty room, he decides to survey it.  Whether there is a trap or not, we know this room is dangerou otherwise he wouldn't roll.  We can't say now that there are orcs there or tax accountants, i just described to him that the room was empty.  and yet if he searches for traps and finds none what are we left with?  Do you see what i am saying now?<br/><br/><b>-"1 sub 3: How could that happen? If they aren't checking, why would they roll?"</b><br/>it could happen becuase they choose not to spend hold on finding the trap....  youre not forced to ask if there is a trap after you roll trap expert (strangely) However, this wouldn't be an issue if you define danger as being many things and not specifically a trap.<br/><br/>-What would a reasonable 6- result be on a trap expert move?  would you simply put a trap there after all or would you make some other bad thing happen?  further, can you save this bad thing for later?  Lastly, do you relate the 6- to the actual intended action?  I prefer this, but it becomes constrained in situations like this. <br/><br/>The problem with saying that a 6- means they spring the trap is that its not any worse than the character just walking through the room without checking, after all if a character walks through and springs the trap, it'll probably be a soft move (unless you think that this is a case of it being a golden opportunity i guess), which is basically the same thing as checking with trap expert since failure on trap expert hits you with a hard move.  Furthermore, if there was actually no traps there before they rolled now you are actually worse off by searching!!!  Mechanically , it hardly seems much benefit to be a trap expert does it?<br/><br/>So with that in mind, do you hit people with hard moves if they don't check for traps?  if not, why bother searching for traps?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435251/#Comment_435251" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T15:33:07+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  3:33PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 3:41PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The move doesn't have to be directly related to the act that failed.<br/>I save the fails (like Hold!) and play them later (but still pretty soon).

I believe it's both/either.  So rolling does not necessarily mean that the area actually <i>is</i> dangerous - only that the player <i>believes</i> it is.  You don't name your move, right?  Similarly, I don't say "you are now in an area officially designated as dangerous."<br/><br/>Saving up moves  - you found it.   Let's say the party fails three rolls in a minute.  If it makes sense at the moment to pile three different moves on them all at once, I'll do it, but more often that's crazy overkill, so I use one, save two, and use them if/when a good moment arises.

The book says that you should start by looking for the obvious result of what they were doing, can that be ignored when saving the move?  I ask this becuase it makes life a heck of a lot easier.<br/><br/>Regarding the phrase 'dangerous place' I can't agree with you on the subjective interpretation -- To interpret this subjectively you would have to say that 'surveying a dangerous area' means that the character suspects its dangerous, first off that isn't strictly whats written, and secondly (and more importantly) no one would ever search a room if they didn't suspect it contained traps, so that means the statement is redundant.  Unless the Dworld writers added extraneous verbage accidentally which didn't get edited out when the book was published, you're left with a statement that serves as a condition that is always met no matter what...and therefore doesn't need to be there... that doesn't make any sense.  I know it may seem like im fixated on this more than i need to be, but i feel like the move starts with those words for a reason.  I wonder if i should email the creators in order to figure out what they meant by this, because it really bothers me. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435258/#Comment_435258" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T16:35:55+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  4:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 4:40PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Q1: Do I relate the hard move to what they did?

(Whether that's sloppy game design or brilliant game design, I'm not sure.)<br/><br/>I read it as:<br/><br/>We must all agree that the area being surveyed is <i>dangerous</i>, definitely. If you think it isn't, ask, "Why?" ("Why do you think your own bedroom is a dangerous place right now?") You'll get a good answer. If that doesn't inspire you with some good responses, I think it's OK to say, "No, you search and find it to be safe. No need to roll here." But chances are that it will.<br/><br/>So: "dangerous"? Yes. Does it mean that there ARE necessarily traps? No. Could be just an area they have good reason to be worried about, and will be very relieved to hear that, no, there are no traps when they ask that particular question.<br/><br/>For what "area" means, use your sense of dramatic judgement: it's probably some separate area that the character has immediate access to right now, but if the Thief is handling a McGuffin Time Bomb, the roll might just apply to the object in their hands right now. Just ask, "Which area are you searching?"<br/><br/>It's self-balancing, because they'll want to focus on the area they're interested in and want to know. <br/><br/>As for what happens on a 6-, yeah, I'd say it should be bad. DW characters, especially those using moves they're good at, succeed far more often than they fail. And it's better to get a 7-9 than to get a soft move in response to not rolling at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435267/#Comment_435267" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T17:07:07+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  5:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The note about "holding back" hard moves is misleading, I think.

Perhaps this stretches the move a bit, but why couldn't a trap be a non-obvious threat like a precarious boulder? Based on the move, I would define a trap as "a specific bad thing (hard move) that has a specific, actionable trigger".<br/><br/>Now let's go back to the fiction.<br/><br/>A dangerous area is one that could potentially hurt the Thief or someone else. The Thief doesn't have to know this, and if they don't search the dangerous area, Trap Expert never triggers. (Back to "the moves trigger when you do what they say".) The Thief prepares to move carefully through the area (note that the move rolls +Dex), and as they carefully move through it to avoid setting off the traps, they're able to gain more information about how the traps are triggered, and thus how to avoid them.<br/><br/>When that Thief enters the dangerous area, they're uncertain. Is it trapped? If so, what traps are there? Can I disarm them? Is there anything else hidden there? It's pretty straightforward. If they ask whether it's trapped, then a "no" tells them that the danger is more obvious, if there is any. Trap Expert is about cutting away that uncertainty and giving the Thief a cold guarantee.<br/><br/>What is a dangerous area? One that the GM knows is dangerous to people. The Thief doesn't have to know this--and it doesn't matter, because if they don't search, the move never comes up. All they have to say is "this area smells funny" and do a search.<br/><br/>Given that, I'm likely to hew closest to your Option 2, but use a time delay as a hard move. Or maybe "you alert them to your presence". "Grim Portents" would be a great hard move here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435272/#Comment_435272" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T17:24:54+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  5:24PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            what if the 6- result is less associated with springing the trap as with not having any way to disarm it.  this would lessen the direness of the fail therefore making it better than just walking through without checking (since that would result in damage if the roll was a miss).  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435273/#Comment_435273" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T17:27:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  5:27PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a><br/>If the danger is more obvious then why didn't the thief notice it right away?

I'm not pushing simulation, i'm pushing realism.  There's a difference.  I don't ask for mechanics to reflect physics, i ask for the story to flow logically, becuase we've all been to the movies and lost interest because the story doesn't follow logical expectations.  The fighter has his signature weapon, that weapon gives him mechanical benefits (peirce, damage bonus etc) to reflect that the logical expectation is that a warrior will kick ass.  If the trap expert is better off putting on a blindfold and walking through the 'dangerous area' then what the heck is that?<br/>This is not about being super optimized tactical players, its just about playing to the niche/archetypes that you would expect.  If the thief sits there looking at his sheet and realizes "fuck its really dumb to look for traps," he won't do it.

The GM should always make a soft move,sure, but always show signs of an approaching threat?  Not always.  You could walk into a room that looks perfectly normal, but oh wait, "there's a pressure plate you stepped on, now arrows are flying towards you, what do you do?"  thats a perfectly reasonable soft move.  People get suprised right?  I agree that you should use a soft move, but the type of soft move varies.  Therefore my point is still valid, because again, the guy who walks through the room and hopes he can defy danger out of it, is more than likely just as competent as the thief who is a supposed 'expert on traps'.  <br/><br/>Weirdness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435279/#Comment_435279" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T18:31:47+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  6:31PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/khimus">@khimus</a><br/>I agree.

He does so knowing that he was better off not searching.  weirdness.</blockquote>\nLet's see:<br/>A PC opens the door to room 6. The GM says "the room is <i>too </i>quiet", shows signs of an approaching threat, whether he/she is a thief or not. The soft move is for everybody, and will probably be in the description of the room. Then, the player may:<br/>a) enter the room cautiously, probably rolling +DEX. But sometimes mere caution is not enough (it will depend on how the trap triggers), and in that case I'd go for a soft (defy danger or be hit) or hard move (deal damage), depending again on the trap.<br/>b) just enter the room, as if it weren't dangerous. Golden opportunity, hard move (that means no defy danger, unless the trap is reeeally rusty/slow).<br/>c) roll for trap expert. If he fails he COULD trigger the trap, but that doesn't need to happen every time he fails: the GM has plenty of other moves to use. This option, or discern realities, lets the player position his character for a less dire failure consequence: he's not walking into the room, he might be surveying it with the famous 10' pole, throw rocks at certain spots, drop water on the floor, whatever. A clever player will describe his PC's action in a way that doesn't excludes the possibility of stepping on the plate, being hit by the blades, whatever. Remember, moves should begin and end with fiction, you can't always say "you were hit by the trap".<br/><br/>I think the benefits of checking for traps are pretty clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435280/#Comment_435280" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T18:37:23+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  6:37PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 6:38PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember that I interpret "dangerous area" both locally and subjectively.  That said...<br/><br/>A trap expert who <b><i>never</i></b> searches for traps...  I'd say that would be kinda like color, not really harmful to the story, it would just become ancillary.  I'm sure they have other moves and skills that will also not be used in this session, after all.  But then again I can't honestly picture a player <i>never</i> doing it, just as I can't picture myself making it 100% useless.  There's a balance, and it has to do with your prep, your style, and the story.  Sometimes the entire story is <i>about</i> searching this massive dungeon, so I get more detailed and the players get more searchy.  Sometimes the dungeon is just one step in a broader story, or a transition from one important place to another (say from the city sewers to the King's Hall), so I move things along more quickly and typically, so will the players.<br/><br/>It also has to do with other player moves, such as <i>discern realities,</i> which doesn't ever tell you flat-out "there is a trap here" but it may let you notice something that MIGHT indicate one.  The bricks line up in a weird way, the floor is slightly sunken in the middle of the hallway, etc.  But hey, maybe it's just some sunken bricks.  Maybe it means this is an earthquake zone.  Lots of possible contexts.  That's why I enjoy the flexibility, and use the emerging narrative arc as my guide.<br/><br/>If they search a few times and find nothing, that doesn't mean traps don't exist <i>in the world</i>.  They still do.  So they describe the act of searching for the trap, and I describe what they sense.  Make it real.  The slimy granite, the sputtering torches, the smell of rotting offal wafting through the halls, I barf forth medievalica.  If they're starting to get boring or needlessly anal about it (searching every ten feet, for instance) and I want them to move along faster, I will start saying things like "...and nothing finds you!"  Another good thing to ask is "How long will you continue searching if you find nothing?"  This hints that time is of the essence, and maybe they should get a move on.<br/><br/>Also, if they happen to roll 6-, something happens, moves, or escalates.  Could be a trap.  Maybe even this one (if it exists).  Could be something else.  Note: Just because something else moves doesn't mean the trap is necessarily gone, either.  That depends on your prep.<br/><br/>A failed Trap Expert roll can trigger an event elsewhere in the dungeon.  Likewise, a failed roll on some other move can trigger the existence of a trap right here.  It's okay for a story element - even a trap - to spring forth from something the players do (or fail to do).  That's exactly how the game works.  It doesn't have to be put there by the GM ahead of time, even though sometimes it is.  It can be "put there" by the players too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435281/#Comment_435281" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T18:43:05+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  6:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 6:49PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so the key to remember is that the flow of the conversation here is all about establishing fictional details and then resolving them. On a good roll, or an excellent idea from the player (absent a roll), things will generally resolve as positively as possible. On a bad roll, or reckless/stupid action from the player, they will resolve as poorly as possible (not every single time, but as a general principle).<br/><br/>So if I walk into a room, and the MC has decreed there is a danger, what do I do? I can try to do careful fictional things and hope that I don't trigger a trap. Or, if I'm a trap expert, I can roll.<br/><br/>But the important part is that the game works best if the moves don't happen in a vacuum. Either way, the MC should describe your circumstances, and you should describe what you're doing, and then something will logically flow from that.<br/><br/>Just because you're rolling a move doesn't mean that <i>you aren't doing something else</i> - it's just that the move allows you to make a roll under circumstances where your buddy doesn't get to roll at all.<br/><br/>So, it really depends on the circumstances, every time (at least if you're doing it right). Walking through the trapped room blindfolded, in my view, is like voluntarily accepting a 6- on the Trap Expert roll. <br/><br/>It's very hard to explain this kind of thing "in a vacuum", without an example. Generally, as soon as you know a) the fictional situation, and b) what the character is doing, it's pretty easy to resolve how things go.<br/><br/>It's all about those two things, here, much more so than the move itself. What's the situation? And: what is the character <i>actually doing</i>?<br/><br/>For instance, let's say your Thief wanders into a small room, and then the door locks behind him. The MC knows that there's a statue with a big diamond in the middle of the room, and, if the diamond is disturbed, the room will start flooding with water.<br/><br/>Now, what is the character doing?<br/><br/>1. Just looking around cautiously?<br/><br/>Without a roll, there probably won't be any particularly dangerous consequences: maybe some time is lost, or weird noises are heard, or the character feels disoriented, or picks up a clue (the sound of water flowing in the walls).<br/><br/>On a failed Trap Expert roll? The same thing.<br/><br/>Either way, the MC is making a move in response to what the player said, based on the character's actions. <br/><br/>2. Poking and prodding at everything, touching things and looking for moving parts?<br/><br/>Without a roll, the character sets off the trap, or gets a "softer" outcome, like being *about to* set off the trap. (Kind of MC's call here, but the easiest way to decide is to keep asking more details about what the character is doing.)<br/><br/>What about a failed Trap Expert roll? Well, same thing.<br/><br/>Either way, the MC is making the most believable, logical move arising from this combination of her prep/ideas and the PC's actions.<br/><br/>This second option suggests pretty strongly that the character WOULD touch the diamond and set off the trap, so that's (quite likely; you can ask more questions to make sure) probably what happens.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As for making a situation dangerous when it wasn't before - that's well in the territory of "ask provocative questions" (is that a Principle or Move in DW? I don't remember). <br/><br/>So the player walks into his bedroom and says he wants to search a dangerous area for traps.<br/><br/>What? How is this dangerous? The MC asks the player just that.<br/><br/>The player responds with something that's on their mind and is logical to them ("Because I've been out of town for two days, and I know my rivals are keen to infiltrate my bedroom and lay a trap!"). Remember: they're only doing this because they already think that this event is likely and believable!<br/><br/>If you also think it's likely, quickly come up with something, and then have them roll. All good!<br/><br/>If you DON'T think the danger exists (the problematic case here), do one of the following:<br/><br/>1. "That's a good thought, but a little search shows there's nothing to fear. No roll needed; it's safe."<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>2. Have them roll. On a good outcome, answer their questions - maybe they'll find a way to get something good out of this. On a miss, make a move, but make a gentle, soft one that is believable to you. Maybe there are no traps, but they find some scratches on the window near the lock: looks like someone was *trying* to get in recently! (And, if the character does nothing about it, now you have something to throw at them the next time they're here.)<br/><br/>(I like number two whenever possible, personally.)<br/><br/>So, yes, you'll be making a move in response. But it doesn't have to be a life-or-death, danger-defying move. Just make <i>as hard a move as you think is reasonable and believable</i>, in accordance to what you know about the situation. (Maybe if there's absolutely no danger AT ALL, their rummaging about makes noise and angers their next-door neighbour. Or they find a peephole looking into their room from the room above. Why is it here? What does it mean? Was someone spying earlier? All these moves do is set you up to make harder moves in the future, having established circumstances for them.)<br/><br/>But remember to ask exactly what the character is doing (so you know whether, for instance, finding a peephole or making a bunch of noise or finding scratches on the window is more likely).<br/><br/>(Cross-posted with at least two of the posts, above.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435283/#Comment_435283" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T19:07:23+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  7:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a><br/>Thanks for taking the time to type...

Fighter enters room 41, still cozy, still heavily laden with traps.  He walks cautiously as you say, he steps on the trap, the blades whir out, because he didn't roll a 6- its a soft move, so i say, "what do you do?" he says, "i duck so the blades fly over my head".

I think he even made character sheets with the details of the moves removed.<br/><br/>Because then the players just say what their characters do. (And most of the problems involved in *World games start when people stop doing that and just say they want to make a certain move, instead.)<br/><br/>That only works, of course, until the players familiarize themselves with the moves.

As in a soft move - ie. a chance to react to whats happening?  Or softer as in not as harsh, less negative consequences but no roll.  <br/>If its the former then you are allowing him to re-roll the roll in a way, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435333/#Comment_435333" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T15:10:26+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  3:10PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cupbearer11,<br/><br/>So, the key here is that it has nothing to do with the move itself. It's just that, when he fails, it's your turn to make a move. And which move you choose depends on what the character was just doing.<br/><br/>The Warrior who was rolling Defy Danger? He probably already set off the trap and is fighting for his life: a dangerous outcome (e.g. damage) is quite appropriate here.<br/><br/>The Thief's "trap expert" move, though, was probably triggered by something safer (like poking ahead with a stick, as khimus suggests). So it's likely you'll choose a "softer" move, like the stick getting chewed up.<br/><br/>(Again, it depends on the specifics in the fiction. What kind of trap is it? Is it the ceiling falling on you? If so, it makes no difference if you're poking around with a stick or not - they're both equally screwed. But if it's a pressure plate which sets off a poisoned dart, it'll probably just whiz by safely if you're poking ahead with a long stick, right? So you might pick a different move, like the torch going out.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435334/#Comment_435334" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T15:26:02+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  3:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2014 3:26PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Pault_T">@Pault_T</a><br/>Yes, that is what i thought you meant.

Look at the fiction, pick a move which sounds interesting and believable, follow your Principles and Agenda.<br/><br/>I think I gave a few examples above.<br/><br/>As with any such question, it really depends on the situation. Give me an example (with sufficient detail) and I can tell you how *I* would think about it; but it won't be a "rules" answer.<br/><br/>The framework of "moves" in a game like Dungeon World (anything based on AW) is less of a formal structure and more of an artistic palette. You have *these* tools at your disposal, and your goal is *that* kind of game: you use the right tools in the right spots to give you the kind of experience you want. <br/><br/>Sometimes that means not making a move where another group would. Sometimes it means using a move in an unexpected place. (Once, in a Monsterhearts game, one PC dropped her glasses onto the sidewalk. Another character - someone she had a crush on, but who was himself very emotionally closed off, and often affected by uncontrollable anger - instead of helping her, stepped on the glasses, breaking them. It was just like a slap in the face. So we used the "shut someone down" move, even though that's usually for pushing someone away in a conversation.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435348/#Comment_435348" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T17:31:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  5:31PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/paul_t">@paul_t</a><br/>that's so cool (the glasses bit).  <br/>And yeah i totally get that, but typically the move that follows should relate to whats happening, a guy searching for traps rolls a 6, other than the trap exploding, i wonder what relatable things could go wrong, I suppose you can sound alarm, have people rush in and whatever but thats not a relatable thing nescessarily to the actions.<br/>its a neat game, i have to say, i'm struggling but i like it.

Say what seems natural to you - it'll still be surprising to the other players, but also flow naturally from what's happening. It's really powerful.<br/><br/>Don't try to stretch to some strange thing: don't have ninjas jump through the door, in other words. Say what comes naturally to you.<br/><br/>Generally, something will come to mind. (After all, you're searching a "dangerous place"... right?)<br/><br/>If nothing comes to mind, then fine, just mention a future problem. "All's good, but if you stay here much longer you'll run out of food. What do you do?" That's a totally valid MC move.<br/><br/>Here, look:\n<blockquote><br/>Reveal an unwelcome truth<br/>Show signs of an approaching threat<br/>Give an opportunity that fits a class\u2019 abilities<br/>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost<br/>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</blockquote>\nAll these MC moves aren't exactly horrible, death-defying stuff!\n<blockquote><br/>Reveal an unwelcome truth - "This trap you're looking at... it has runes on it marking it as Dwarven craftsmanship." -"But that would mean that... oh, shit!"<br/>Show signs of an approaching threat - "While you've been looking around the tower, you can see thunderclouds forming in the distance. Did you say you left all those books uncovered back at the camp?"<br/>Give an opportunity that fits a class\u2019 abilities - "The runes on the trap... someone with arcane knowledge might be able to decipher them, given enough time."<br/>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost - "If someone was willing to climb down into the mud, you could probably pry this whole mechanism out of the chamber. Do you want to?"<br/>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask - etc, etc.</blockquote>\nIf the situation is such that really, honestly, nothing bad or dangerous or scary can happen, then great! It means the players have maneuvered themselves into a position where they're "winning": they're safe, they have the upper hand, they have control of the situation. Let them enjoy it! They earned a break.<br/><br/>Probably time to start setting up future trouble, though. (Or else the game will get boring.)<br/><br/>When someone rolls a 6- in a *World game, that's what the rules say:<br/><br/>"MC, it's your turn to say what happens next. Make a move!"<br/><br/>So, given your vision of the current situation, what's a thing that could believably happen? Say that.<br/><br/>You can often (but shouldn't always) think of it as: given the current situation, what's a reasonably way things could go wrong?<br/><br/>In a fight with a giant, that could mean getting your head caved in. When you're eating soup at the King's manor, it might just mean you spill some on your shirt. <br/><br/>It's your job to set up a bunch of threats the players have to worry about. When they miss rolls, you can bring them to bear. If the players have managed to be clever enough to neutralize all these threats ("Nope, remember, we said we draped tarps over the books!"), then, good, they should reap the rewards and face smaller problems.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435354/#Comment_435354" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T19:27:29+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  7:27PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2014 7:28PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nice.  thanks for the advice.
