This creates an Angie-Bob pool (starting at one die).  Angie is the most recent contributor, and as such she can neither <i>contribute</i> nor <i>take the pool</i>.  Bob is not the most recent contributor.  As such, he may choose to take all the dice in the pool and add them to one of his rolls.  OR, at some later point, he may choose to contribute another die to the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Bob contributes another die then he becomes the most recent contributor ... and now Angie is the one who has the opportunity to take all the dice in the pool and add them to one of her rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can easily see social situations where neither side would want to take the dice from the pool:  Angie wouldn't want to <i>deprive Bob</i> in order to benefit herself ... even if Bob was telling her in the most definite terms to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume, for the sake of argument, that Angie's roll cannot ever, directly or indirectly, come back to benefit Bob as well.  It's for her, and her alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'd be an interesting little dynamic.  I wonder how it would turn out in play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101976/#Comment_101976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:22:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What sort of game would you be looking to play with it?<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101991/#Comment_101991" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:54:34+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.

Each "Panel" (sort of a round), you regenerate stones into your pool depending on how injured you are.<br/><br/>I had a "Drama Pool" of free stones anyone could take - one for the villains and a smaller one for the heroes. There were various things that could replenish the heroes' drama pool (getting injured, etc.) but also villains' spending out of their Drama Pool went into the heroes'.<br/><br/>Anyone could take as much out as they wanted at any time.

This way, when the group comes to a consensus that one particular member would make the best contribution at a critical moment an ally chucks in a directed die and that member rolls the whole thing.<br><br>If there is a slow refresh rate for dice contributions this keeps the pool sizes down, since people will wait a long time to get that benefit again. Aside from that, the main concern would be that once people hit on this strategy it's basically not much different than having any other sort of communal pool. This could be avoided by templating dice so that they don't work in the same way all the time. If a die is a Magic die or a Violent Die or a Hope die and plus into other resources in specific ways this mandates multiple strategies instead of just the best one.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102172/#Comment_102172" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T05:22:51+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  5:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm:  I'm guessing that you missed this bit:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Assume, for the sake of argument, that Angie's roll cannot ever, directly or indirectly, come back to benefit Bob as well.

As a system, your statement about not benefiting Bob can obvious be worked around by simply bouncing the pool back to him and not using it. The players make a deal hat this will happen and there you go.<br/><br/>You might also say that Angie can never use this to use an ability that affects Bob wit another system. No Cure Wounds for Bob. This becomes increasingly difficult to enforce the more abstract it gets. Can Angie stab Fred, who is threatening Bob, with the pool? Can Angie stab Fred Fred with those dice because Bob wants him to die? If there's a table conversation that ends in a rough consensus of Fred-stabbing, is Bob merely pleased after the fact, or is Bob "benefiting?"<br/><br/>Anyway, let's take players A, B and C. Each of them have 4 dice. This leads to the following permutations in sequence using the first three dice:<br/><br/>ABC (C may use or kick to A or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/><br/>BCA (A may use or kick to B o C)<br/>CAB (B may use or kick to A or C)<br/><br/>One participant has 3 dice or provides one of two others with 4.<br/><br/>Now you can control this by, for example, demanding that dice maneuvers always happen in the turn before use and then reducing turn granularity (one roll for an entire scene, for instance). That means I can't gather intelligence telling me that B, who is best at Orc stabbing, should get the pool because we have to stab some orcs. Whoever has it either stabs orcs *now* or kicks the pool over, and nobody can use it until next turn.<br/><br/>The disadvantage to this is that we must consider what the system for gathering intelligence about a turn's circumstances is.<br/><br/>Stuff like that.<br/><br/>Oh, also people should be altruistic and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102193/#Comment_102193" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T07:07:39+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  7:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm:  Rather than trying to understand what I'm saying, you're arguing that I can't be saying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with that.

It should be easy for you to point out precisely where I'm misunderstanding you given that I've actually posted a model. <br/><br/>There is a level where you can talk about sentimental effect and a level where it really is all about the cruel math. It seems to me that you want this tit for tat with multiple ways of using it. Good, multiple ways of doing it are about rational strategies. One of the know factors in games with tit for tat elements (like successive Prisoners Dilemma) is the increasing role of trust and cooperation through multiple iterations.<br/><br/>Let's look at A and B (no C, here)<br/>A gives a die to B. B can spend the die or kick it back. The rational thing for B to do is to spend the die *unless* B can trust A to either kick the pool back or spend the higher amount on something that benefits B. The dice pool can *only* rationally escalate when one party trusts the other to act for mutual benefit. If this is the case, it isn't important who has the pool, only that it is maxed out as much as possible. If this isn't the case, there is no reason to even use the system. If there is a penalty for contributing this lowers the maximum to dice - some minimum competence, but the maximum is still desirable. If there is no trust, then any participation is even more undesireable.<br/><br/>Now you can say, "But people aren't rational!" and you'd be right, but it's not necessarily a statement that you can hang a system on.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102200/#Comment_102200" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T07:40:41+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  7:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To some degree, everything that happens in my current play group is for mutual benefit because everyone is so strongly committed to the idea of "the team".

If I give you a die, I obviously don't expect you to use it to kick me in the nads. This removes antagonism. Now you can use it to kick somebody I don't care about either way in the nads, but this means that I am not inclined to give you a die again unless I like you. Me liking you and expressing it is just a way for me to maximize *my* utility(+1). But if I lose something, I also lose utility(-1), leaving me with no rational reason to use the system (0, but better than betrayal, which is -2 if we equate dice and utility units, which makes sense since I cannot see the butterflies in your soul or anything and have nothing else to go on).<br/><br/>If, on the other hand I give you a die (-1 for me) and you're doing something I want (+1) *and* I like you (+1 utility), then it's all good (-1+1+1=1).

With something like Escape or Die, you would simply never do it unless you liked the person for no particular reason. If that's not allowed, you might do it for non-system reasons. Expecting a non-system motivated response to continue the cycle doesn't make much sense from the perspective of designing a game system, per se. There's nothing wrong with allowing irrational options, of course, but there will be a compelling reason to get around this as much as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102229/#Comment_102229" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T09:25:40+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  9:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony - thanks for the example, I've never seen it or played it or played anything like that, so I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. <br/><br/>That said, if I understand the suggestion correctly, I don't agree that a decision to help someone else win is necessarily irrational.

I think that people have motives other than selfish ones.  Sometimes you decide that it's more important to you to help someone else than to empower yourself.<br/><br/>I find the <i>deadlock</i> situation, where you want to help someone but they refuse to accept your help (possibly because they want to help YOU instead) to be a fascinating one ... and I'm pleased that it can be formulated in rules-terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102446/#Comment_102446" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T09:59:59+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  9:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2007 10:07AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Tony's found the flaw in the math, which is that the value of helping others, if it can be +1, can be more than +1. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of this comes down to what the goal of the game is for the participant. If, for example, it's to show themselves tactically superior to the other players, then the -1 is actually probably higher than -1, and people won't use this. If, on the other hand, the goal of the game is to make value statements to each other, then the value of helping others could be quite high for the individual. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the problem here, Tony, you haven't given a context for the mechanic. Basically it'll totally depend on that context as to what the values are, and whether or not it'll work to produce the behaviors that you're looking for. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's to say nothing of the range of players who may be playing. For instance, if the game is about value statements, some players may want to make a statement about selfishness, in which case the value for giving is very low. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the "pariah cookie" effect... it doesn't happen to some of us (and JD, how "Feeling" of you). I almost always eat the last piece of pizza. I see it siting there, I estimate if everyone has had their fill, and, if so, I ask if I can have it (I have, apparently, an infinite capacity to consume pizza). The "pariah" effect comes about because of a very specific reason... people believe that they will be resented for taking the last item. Worse, they believe that if they ask if they can have the last piece, that other people, not wanting to be resented themselves for being selfish, will tell you that it's OK for you to take that last piece, even if they don't mean it. In which case you're putting stress on them by making them lie to seem nice. So people don't ask, beacuse they don't want to put that stress on the other person, in case they do want it, forcing them either to contest you for the piece or to lie. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just think that the negative utility to those people is simply far less than the positive of my own satisfaction for eating that piece of pizza. After all... they might actually not want it. So I ask, assume people are being honest, and take the piece if they say so. And if they do want it, I don't fear working that out between us... maybe we can split it. <br/>\n<br/>\nCall this Mike's Pizza Version of Pascal's Gamble. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of the dice pool, we can't split the die, but like Malcolm points out, we might trade off on iterative instances. I'll take the benefit this time, understanding that it's your turn next time. (Nash may have been crazy at times, but he was a genius, too, to have been on the Rand team that discovered the difference between single and iterative plays of games).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting that this phenomenon is sorta the reverse of the Tragedy of the Commons. The Pariah Cookie could be called The Tragedy of the Rejected Commons, where nobody gets to use the commons, not because they get used up by one participant, but because nobody wants to deny anybody else the effect of the Commons. The game Republic of Rome reinforces this sort of thing by having there be a negative outcome for the player if they do perpetrate a Tragedy of the Commons (that tragedy being that the game wins, and all players loose, including the perpetrating player). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be interesting to have a second mechanic whereby players were rewarded for helping each other out, such that this other mechanic creates a direct incentive not to steal the dice from the other players. <br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of the context problem, there really still is an open question about the mechanic: is the goal of the mechanic really to strip dice from the players? And, if so, why are we leaving an option to go against the mechanic? Why not just force it? If there's an option, it has to exist to make the gameplay more interesting in a thematic or tactical way as a choice. Else why have the choice? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what's the context, and what's the goal of the mechanic within it? If you don't answer these, then we can't actually predict at all whether or not the mechanic is a worthwhile idea. I'm sure it can be implemented into something interesting. It'll just vary in nature by the individual implementation. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102456/#Comment_102456" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T10:26:28+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>So what's the context, and what's the goal of the mechanic within it?</blockquote>I put this in the "Little Ideas" category on purpose.

People can also want to leave the last cookie for other people because they want those other people to be happy and to enjoy a cookie.<br/><br/>There's this <i>real fine line</i> that folks who like utility theory tend to walk ... it's oh so very easy to conflate the following:<br/><br/>(a) "To fit altruism into utility theory, we say 'Person B's happiness' has a measurable value to Person A.  Then our equations still work out."<br/>(b) "Person A values Person B's happiness only because of some measurable value that it delivers back to them.  The equations prove it!"<br/><br/>I'm seeing, frankly, a <b>lot</b> of such conflation in the responses of those trying to push utility-theory mathematics in this thread.  I think y'all are letting the numbers get you tangled ... and I say this as a rigorously trained mathematician.<br/><br/>So:  Does the happiness of Jen enjoying the last cookie have value to me?  Yes.  Must that value be something that directly impacts me, like "She won't resent me for taking the last cookie" or "Next time we have cookies she'll let me have the last one"?  No.  I can (and do) value things outside of myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102466/#Comment_102466" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T10:46:47+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me rephrase.

In fact, I pointed out in my post right before yours that the altruism itself might be a more potent factor, agreeing with your math. So by "folks" you mean Malcolm? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just don't see that as the Pariah Case. That's the "Everybody's Being Altruistic" case. The Pariah Case involves, as described above, people not taking the cookie not because they don't want it, but because they're afraid of being a Pariah if they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth the Pariah situation and the Altruism case will come up in play, I'd guess. They'll have the same effect, but for different reasons. My point is that while a player like myself might be subject to the Altruism case, I'm not to the Pariah case (I don't fear Pariah-dom). So for some players it's going to work to incentivize certain behaviors at different times than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

If not, it has no real standing. We all like altruism, but the fact is that this system could simulate the pleasure an insane or immoral person gets from killing a tortured animal. Each pass represents another round of torture. The animal's pain increases the pleasure of the final killer with each pass, but delays murderous gratification for everyone else.<br/><br/>Somehow, I think if this thread was called "Harnessing torture-murder," the enthusiasm for its value would be . . . muted.<br/><br/>But of course, in any iterative use where I am charmed by these sentimental appeals, we achieve pretty much the same results, as follows:<br/>A gets utility from passing to B<br/>B gets utility from passing to A<br/>They run out of dice. Since A and B both expect pleasure from passing dice, it is in either one's interest to spend the dice and resume the passing phase.<br/><br/>Thus, we get pretty much the same result: max out and spend. It doesn't matter if the utility is equal or unequal since each pass if good for either party, unless one party isn't altruistic, in which case that party spends -- it doesn't matter when.<br/><br/>Again, the rate at which we can refresh dice matters because it influences our expectations of being able to do whatever it is we enjoy. There's a difference between eating the last cookie when you don't know if there will be more and when you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102625/#Comment_102625" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T05:39:43+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:39AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tony, do you know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_game" rel="nofollow">Centipede Game</a>?

But Tony's "sentimental" nature is actually good enough. The game in question, if it requires high altruism to work, may just be for highly altruistic players. It doesn't have to work for everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr the level to which it works can actually be a test of the player's altruism. Or any number of things. But, yes, for certain individuals the number can be higher than +1. This is a known and accepted variable in Game Theory. The Centipede Game that Simon points out is one such game meant to test the extent to which altruism varies in individuals, but it's part of a long series of investigations into the phenomenon of how altruism affects the Game Theory math. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm not mistaken, this was first hypothesized and observed by the Rand guys again, about the same time as they were noting the variance in iterative games versus single plays. Game Theory is not always so straightforward. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd further I agree with your assessment for what I'll call rationalist altruists like me (and I think you), where the Pariah effect doesn't occur. But, again, the pariah effect does occur for some people and, for those, the value of allowing the pool to be available to the other player is greater than that of taking it for yourself at any time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, again, context, context, context. I think that, in practice what actually varies is a lot is the negative figure. That is, in some cases the need to draw on those dice may become relatively higher and lower. In fact this is obviously the case... you don't take the dice if there's no roll to make. You don't take the dice if the roll is trivial. There's some threshold that the negative figure in this case is smaller than the positive figure that we haven't put into the math of opportunity cost. Will I, or anyone else, need those dice more later? The point being that there's always increasing and decreasing value to the incentive to take the dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm seeing as interesting with the mechanic is not so much the effect that Tony is interested in... I see that as only one of several behaviors that can emerge from such a mechanic. I'm interested in that I think that they will, in fact, produce this range of behaviors at different times. Balanced correctly (and this may be difficult), you may tend to see both the behavior that you're expecting, the behavior that Tony is expecting, and other behaviors as well. I find this fascinating, because like other such mechanics, these behaviors make statements about the importance of what's happening in the game to the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis happens with many mechanisms in games. But in this case, the statement is all the stronger, I think, because the player at some point is saying, "This is so important to me that I'm going to damage everybody else somewhat to say so." <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related tangent, it may be interesting to note that, in fact, Tony's game is actually somewhat pessimistic, as compared to many modern biologists views on the nature of altruism as a winning game strategy. That is, in real life survival, it turns out that altruism may well be highly incentivized, given that, well, we've evolved into social animals. Here's a couple of interesting links:<br/>\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/<br/>\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/<br/>\nhttp://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/ethics-biology.html<br/>\nhttp://www.sysc.pdx.edu/download/papers/jtb_2006_09.html<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of this theory was started by this guy: <br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those following who may not get Malcolm's Tit-for-Tat reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat<br/>\nhttp://www.gametheory.net/News/Items/026.html<br/>\n<br/>\nThese guys have a strong bias, obviously, but the reading is still good: http://www.altruists.org/downloads/by_subject/others/game_theory/<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, these all tend to emphasize "reciporical altruism" which is what Malcolm is siting. For ideas about high levels of altruism that do not require the reciporical part to function, see:<br/>\nhttp://ideas.repec.org/p/pit/wpaper/309.html<br/>\nhttp://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/sydnec/99-12.html<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point of some of the evolutionary argumets is simply that, as we've evolved to become beings where altruism is embedded in us because of it's benefits, inevitably some of us vary in the height of our altruism to where, in fact, it's higher in terms of emotional return than it is in any rational terms of utility provided. For these individuals, yes, the value here for the altruistic act is higher than +1. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, as people say, it's all about having "fun," right? For these individuals the emotional return is less from maximizing some other benefit than it is from maximizing their emotional investment through something like altruism. I think this is going to be especially true in RPGs, where there are no actual physical benefits, only fictional ones for characters. Yes, if the play is about proving your superiority as a specimen in tactical terms, that might militate against this. But Tony is talking about games where, specifically, the goal of play is to prove how cool you are by intelligently discussing your values. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, I think he's got a strong case for there being many people who'd play the game and get some of the effects he's talking about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to be posting a related thread on this subject elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102654/#Comment_102654" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T07:36:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  7:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I should make it clear that I'm not talking about altruism in the theoretical sense (genuinely giving without personal satisfaction), but as a label for a thing that provides utility to the altruist.<br/><br/>I think that if there's a mix of altruists and non-altruists, then it looks very much like you'd get more interesting results. The non-altruist wonders when the train ride ends -- how many dice can he score? Thanks for bringing that up, Mike.<br/><br/>I'd predict, though, that over multiple iterations, when the non-altruists spend the dice all the time and get identified, they'd stop getting dice if the altruists started feeling punitive.<br/><br/>The last cookie effect is something I think would really get altered by iterations of expenditure. If the last cookie is the last cookie on a tray in a bakery, I'd eat that sucker. Then I can fill the tray and more cookies for everybody!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102656/#Comment_102656" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T07:54:04+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  7:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>On a related tangent, it may be interesting to note that, in fact, Tony's game is actually somewhat pessimistic, as compared to many modern biologists views on the nature of altruism as a winning game strategy.</blockquote>Depends on what you think of as pessimism, I suppose.  I think the idea that altruism occurs even when it <i>cannot be</i> the winning strategy on the individual scale is a pretty optimistic notion.  Faith in human nature, people looking out for others, and all that jazz.<br/><br/>In fact I've been pretty seriously tempted by this discussion to make a game where reciprocal altruism isn't a working strategy.  Goes something like this:<br/><br/>Characters start with a certain amount of Sadness.  Nothing a character can do for themselves ever makes the Sadness go away.<br/>Players may get their characters into Trouble, in proportion to their Sadness.<br/>The more Trouble your character is in, the more Help they may offer another character.<br/>If you choose to accept someone's Help then you radically reduce both your character's Trouble and Sadness.<br/>Absent Help from someone else, Trouble eventually resolves to added Sadness.<br/><br/>The best selfish-for-the-character strategy here is to con somebody into helping you, then ditch them.  My player-values strategy would probably be to aim to help somebody to happiness, and then be content that my character, sad though he is, had acted from love and had made a difference.  Sad, but satisfying.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the Game theory analysis of what would be optimaxed strategy, I'll just point out that two players cannot successfully pursue my preferred strategy on each other:  If they are both aiming to bring happiness to each other, and neither is willing to abandon that plan by accepting help, then they're actually in a wierd sort of conflict.

There's also pie in the sky totally selfless altruism that makes the rounds in converstion, but IME almost all thought experiments are about the altruist getting something and immediately rejecting total selflessness as an incoherent position.
