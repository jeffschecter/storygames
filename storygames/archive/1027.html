                            Meg, I'm really interested in this, but I don't know much about it. How similar is it to the "1000 Nights" rules on the website? Did it change much during playtest?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Heya Graham,<br/><br/>I played 1001 Nights with Meg this last weekend, and I have some reflections on it <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/jiffycon-1-after-action-report/" rel="nofollow">in this blog post</a>. <br/><br/>Some relevant comments:
<blockquote>The game has a nice structure to it that combines with the included setting elements (like the fact that thereâ€™s a menu in the text, and that part of character creation is choosing what your character wears) to create a very poetic atmosphere, and I think we grooved on that well. I wrote down the titles that I made up in my head for the stories we told:<br/><br/>Megâ€™s character, a palace gardener, told The Story Of Yasmina And Mahmoud As They Struggled Up The Mountain.<br/><br/>My character, the dwarf entertainer, told The Story Of The Boy Of The Earth As He Travelled To The Clouds (And Back Again).<br/><br/>Brennanâ€™s second character, an assistant Astrologer, told The Story Of The Magician And The Herbalist As They Healed The Sultanâ€™s Neice And Nephew Of Illnesses Of The Flesh And Spirit.<br/><br/>Structurally, itâ€™s a rotating GM game where, when youâ€™re GMing, you have your character tell a story with representational figures that map to the other characters being played, because itâ€™s the only way to do things like express dissent or complain or say the forbidden in the Sultans palace without incurring his displeasure. Itâ€™s a fun game, and I would totally play it again some evening when I feel lazy and happy and imaginative.</blockquote>
I hope some of that is helpful!                        </div>

                            There are changes, most notably that each player starts with only three gems, and after the Story GM has recieved the 8th gem, that Story has to wrap up. No winning the game in one Story. The rules for interupts and meddling with other Courtier's Ambitions are new and/or better now, too.                        </div>

                            Ok, here are the answers. It's still hot and sticky, by the way. Take it as a sign of my dedication that I'm down here at the computer instead of up in my air-conditioned bedroom <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Q: Why the Arabian Nights theme? Did you choose it because it supported the storytelling, or on a whim, or because you've always liked it, or why?<br/>A: I love it, I've always loved it, and it was what I thought of from the very begining. The idea of telling stories to pass the time, stories that are as dramatic and engaging as any RP session could ask for, seemed a natural fit. I write about this in the preface of the game, too, about the need for fantastical tales from places not our own.<br/><br/>Q: How did you go about getting it ready for publishing? <br/>A: Mostly I tried not to write it (really), then I wrote it on two different computers. A very large part of the text was typed with one hand, using the lap-top while the baby was napping next to me. Then I spent some very late nights with Vincent and Adobe InDesign doing lay-out. The book looks so close to how I'd imagined it's kind of freaky. I also have a well-estabilished relationship with our printers from being the main person to deal with Dogs printing, so that was a non-issue.<br/><br/><br/>Q: What's the art like? <br/>A: Oh, the ART! I *love* the art. It's all beautiful black ink illustrations that were made by H.J. Ford a hundred years ago for Andrew Lang - I had nearly all the Rainbow Fairy Books as a child, and this game grew straight out of them. When I was a kid, Mom didn't buy us coloring books, so once I reached about 10, I took my colored pencils to the Rainbow Fairy Books, with Mom's blessing. Shading all those pictures taught me a ton about drawing and draping. I thought about doing the same thing in Photoshop with the ones I use  in the book, but I decided against it.<br/> <br/>Q: How did you choose the fonts and the front cover? - it looks as though a lot of thought went into the style generally.<br/>A: Absolutely. I knew I wanted a sunset that was really rich in color, and that I wanted arches. I fiddled with gradients in Photoshop untill I was happy, and I free-hand drew the arch in Photoshop, then scanned a sheet from a Dover 'stained glass' coloring book for the rosettes. There was a brief time when the first piece of art in the book was on the cover, but it didn't hold up under examination. <br/><br/>The cover font is Calif - I wanted something with a very soft, curving shape. I considered doing hand-caligraphy, but my 'hand' for this style is lousy, and the font was fine.<br/><br/>Q: Are you doing demos at GenCon? <br/>A: Yes! I also expect to do at least one after-hours game.<br/><br/>Q: What are they like?<br/>A: I'll bring a selection of nearly-complete characters to the table, you'll choose one and finish it up, and we'll play through a Story, or at least enough of one for me to be sure everyone's getting the 'declare interests' bit. <br/><br/>Q: So, what about the story-in-a-story thing, does it do that?<br/>A: Well, the basic game has our characters telling Stories, so it's already a story-in-a-story, so the simple answer is yes. To make deeper levels, all it would take would be for someone's Story character to start a Story-within, and see how it went. As far as mechanics, I'll have to think about it. I think it's possible to go down at least two levels, so Court, Story, Story-Within. I'd suggest having different GMs for the two Story levels. And you can definitly do linked Stories already, sharing characters or setting or whatever.                        </div>
