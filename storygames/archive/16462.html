Champions of ZED weaves together the scattered rules and intentions of original game authors Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax, including revisions drawn from the long lost Beyond This Point Be Dragons manuscript.<br/>\nCoZ is built from the ground up for sanbox play, following the methods of the original game. It hearkens to a time when players built their fantasy worlds together, one hex at a time, when vanilla settings from far off publishing houses simply did not exist; when a handful of dice and creative minds crafted and conquered worlds of their own.<br/>\nPlease visit my Kickstarter page and become a patron of this project: <br/>\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/280000504/champions-of-zed-zero-edition-dungeoneering                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer" title="geordie racer"><img alt="geordie racer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer">geordie racer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376666/#Comment_376666" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T00:27:15+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 12:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Daniel, looks like the kickstarter's off to a good start, good luck with it. I've a few questions if that's alright - <br/><br/>- How does much does COZ differ to Dragons at Dawn ?<br/><br/>- Have you played the rules - does anything emerge from play that differs from OD&amp;D ?<br/><br/>- What's the pagecount for CoZ so far ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DHBoggs" title="DHBoggs"><img alt="DHBoggs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379844/#Comment_379844" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T04:52:50+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  4:52AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Geordi,<br/>\n<br/>\nTook me a while to get back to this board....<br/>\n<br/>\n1. There are a few points of crossover between D@D and CoZ - the rules for getting lost frex, but for the most part the games are quite distinct.  D@D as you know focuses on the uniques aspects of play going on in Blackmoor.  CoZ is very much OD&amp;D, fleshed out with the information left us by both Gygax and Arneson.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Only in the combat system, which is the offspring of my "OD&amp;D with CHAINMAIL" write up.  CHAINMAIL is, of course not OGL material firstly, and secondly has to be substantially houseruled to make work with OD&amp;D anyway.  Anyone familiar with CM will feel right at home when running one of the three combat methods given in CoZ.  I use the "Fighting Capability" statistic and break it down between "Fantastic" and "Mundane" opponents as seen in CM and as Gygax instructed in the Strategic Review FAQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.
