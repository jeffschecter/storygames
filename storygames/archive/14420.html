I missed Sunday, so maybe things went horribly downhill after I left, but Friday and Saturday were one-hundred-percent, uninterrupted, across-the-board fun. The games were great, of course, and the space itself was fantastic, but it was the mix of people that really made it for me: friends from other places, folks that I'd met before but finally had a chance to really spend time with, brand new folks that turned out to be amazing, people who knew story games backwards and forwards, other people who'd never played any kind of RPG at all before. I'll probably post about specific stuff later today, but it was really special. Many thanks to Grace, Jackson, Ross, and all of the volunteers that made it possible.<br/><br/>Also, did a quote board ever get put up? I saw folks jotting things down during games, but don't know if they were ever collected anywhere. If not, I'll start:<br/><br/>"You guys built A CHURCH before you built A SHOVEL!" -Joe McDaldno, incredulous at the misplaced priorities of our post-apocalyptic village of feral children in The Quiet Year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327933/#Comment_327933" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T06:47:54+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  6:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 6:51AM by jdfristrom.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, consistent awesome.<br/><br/>This guy stood over us as we played Seid:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://gamedevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c462853ef01538efcd242970b-pi"/><br/><br/>The Princess (Amnesiack) promises the King (John Powell) "If the Earl asks me to marry him, I will say yes" and then goes about studying the magic to still the Earl's tongue.

Good thing, because I was being blamed for murder and I really, really wanted the victim to be alive...<br/><br/><br/>And Carl also ran Lacuna in the jungle safari room the next morning:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://gamedevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c462853ef01538efcd1f5970b-pi"/><br/><br/>Oh MAN. I wish I could have my memories of Lacuna removed so I could play it again for the first time. That's all I'll say - if you haven't played Lacuna, find someone to run it for you. And if anyone tries to explain it to you first plug your ears and sing "I'm not listening to you mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb"<br/><br/><br/>Finally, Planet Algol by Johnstone in the outer space theater. (Home of the space bear.)  I think that is the first time I've loved a game for its setting. Usually I'm all "*I* want to participate in the setting creation, screw your pre-made setting" but this time I was like, "Yeah, this place is awesome." It was also fun to use the "Autarch's Hand" spell to seize a blade-demons glowing heart by force ... and inadvertently take it into my own body. Can just imagine the countdown clock on that one.<br/><br/><br/>So yeah, thanks Ross, Jackson and crowd!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327974/#Comment_327974" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T09:37:56+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  9:37AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get jealous often.<br/>I am now jealous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327991/#Comment_327991" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:41:36+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was an amazing convention. The wonderful organizers took all the awesomeness of the Go Play NW model, removed the pre-scheduled games, and then tossed us into beautiful and inspiring art installations. Lesley and I were there all day Friday and for the first two sessions on Saturday, but then we had to leave early, much to our sadness. Still, I got in six games, all of which were great: Microscope, Perfect Unrevised, Fiasco, Love In The Time of Seid, 7 Wonders, and Monsterhearts. This is now definitely the other "must attend" yearly convention for me alongside GPNW.<br/><br/>I took a bunch of pictures that I will hopefully post once I've gotten them all off my phone.

Also, I got to game with two of the artists in each of the spaces they'd created- the Human Organ and the Dark Forest, which was really interesting. <br/><br/>Two important thing I feel the art installations (and the organizers) did as a whole:<br/>-Create an overall atmosphere of (for lack of a better word) <b>wonder,</b> that, for me, was pervasive throughout the weekend.<br/>-Instantly and creatively created these cozy and unique little gaming areas inside this super large space- so even with a lot of games running at once, I never felt crowded, or that it was too loud- each game felt insulated and intimate, which was rad.<br/><br/>Moving on to further gushing:<br/>Met a ton of really amazing people, the majority of which I only knew from the interweird. I feel like I might have a whole new second gaming group in Seattle now! <br/><br/>Played (mostly) games I've never played before: Inspecters, The Quiet Year, The Dreaming Crucible, Kategematsu, Fiasco, Capes, Monster Hearts.<br/><br/>Had lots of great food and gaming conversation with folks throughout the weekend (so much that my voice is near gone today).

I've got quite a few pictures of the incredible space, which I'll try to get posted soon.<br/><br/>To answer your first question, Jason, it's hard for me to separate the physical environment from the emotional one. The fact that people had put so much effort and creativity into creating a gaming space was visually amazing, but it also lent a distinct current of welcome and support that ran under everything we played. At other cons, even intimate house cons, there's always a feeling that you're borrowing the place to do something that really doesn't belong there. Obviously that was true of the Procession of the Species studio too, but it didn't feel that way: it felt like it was meant, at least for this weekend, just for gaming with these new and old friends.<br/><br/>As for organization, there were slots set out in advance but nothing actually scheduled. (I think the forum could potentially have been used for that, but I don't think it saw much activity--that may change next time!) It was just the standard gather-and-pitch session, with Ross or Jackson calling everyone over from atop a giant mushroom forest. Facilitators pitched their games, players gravitated to them, and the Mushroom King made sure no one was left behind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean" title="rian_bean"><img alt="rian_bean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/311/nCMERNOS5J27N.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean">rian_bean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328040/#Comment_328040" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T13:58:27+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  1:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically, at the beginning of each session (3-4 sessions per day:, 10 am, 2 pm, 7 pm, and sometimes 11 or midnight) we would all gather round the "mushroom throne". <br/><br/>Jackson or Ross would ask facilitators to step forward and pitch the games they were willing to run, after which, all the players just migrated towards the game they were interested in.<br/><br/>It was really casual and friendly.

Every day had the following:<br/><br/>Slot 1: 10am-1pm<br/>Slot 2: 2pm-6pm<br/>Slot 3: 7pm-10pm<br/>Slot 4: 10pm-2am<br/><br/>The last two slots tended to be a little fuzzier in practice, with people often playing a game that started at 7 and went a little long, etc.<br/><br/>Games were organized at the beginning of each session by Ross or Jackson sitting up on the toadstool platform and calling for GMs/facilitators. The volunteers would then give 30 second game pitches and whoever was interested in playing with them would walk over and stand next to them. Once everyone was sorted into a game, groups broke off and found a space to play. Rinse and repeat. Occasionally, a group would organize something in advance, and then just jump right in once the slot rolled around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328042/#Comment_328042" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T14:08:24+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  2:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Tori and Brendan covered the influence of the installations pretty well. There was definitely a strong sense of "This is a place for telling cool stories in a variety of mediums" that permeated the entire con, and the art was a big part of that. The art areas also served a very practical purpose as physical dividers that helped groups separate from one another and diminished the noise factor. Whether or not the art informed the games themselves really depended on the game and installation combo. For instance, the amazingly cool Multi-Dimensional Chamber Of Light was fun to play in, but it didn't really have any thematic effect on our Fiasco game that I could perceive. However, the Dark Woods definitely influenced the picture I had in my head of our surroundings as I played Love In The Time of Seid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328043/#Comment_328043" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T14:10:32+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  2:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Triple cross-post and your stories match!

You were mean too!) and I lose my character-defining sense of snow. Then again that fucker hit my pregnant sister, so screw him.<br/><br/>Johnzo responds by confronting a murderous military coup of inexperienced knights with their own gullibility, watching them murder each other while trying to decide what to do, then <i>disinterring his ex-lover in order to wear his face as a mask</i> while walking through the city, raising the previously-murdered ruling class from the dead.<br/><br/><br/><b>Kagematsu</b>, Saturday afternoon.<br/>A village struggling to survive on the tourist trade surrounding a holy shrine is beset by sinister shadow creatures, who seem intent on the shrine and have a rather deletirious effect on the local economy. Kagematsu, a fabled "shadow boxer" and samurai, has come to the village to read a lot of scrolls -- and I do mean a lot of scrolls -- and is our only hope, both for saving the village and love/lovin'. Kagematsu is really tall, has intense grey eyes, rarely speaks, and has long black hair. He is in his 50s, and is played by Grace, who also constructed the giant human heart in which we are playing the game.<br/><br/>I play "Moonlight", the innocent daughter of the innkeeper who loves listening to visitors' stories, covets her mother's beautiful wedding dress, and really wants to get out of this goddamn town. I am fascinated by the shadows and manage to impress Kagematsu with my unsurpassed physical beauty, bountiful curiousity, and ability to quote apposite classical haiku -- and also that part where I rescued a crying child from the well, after a shadow's kidnapping attempt interrupted my attempt to introduce myself.. But even though I scolded and begged and threatened Kagematsu -- and even secured a tearful, romantic declaration of love! -- I could not convince him to save the town, and it turned out he didn't even love me best! <br/><br/>Tori plays my mother, "Lady Sparrow (?)", a widow of convenience who can only manage to love one of her daughters -- my stupid sister, who can sing prettily but can't be bothered to do any chores -- and uses the rest as slave labour in the tavern, refusing to even buy them nice dresses! She foolishly believes that her experience, charm, and proximity to Kagematsu's age will somehow allow her to win his heart, instead of just interfering with her eldest daughter's one chance for love -- but even flashing Kagematsu on the stairs is not enough to get him to touch her. She does however manage to save the town in the end, by chasing him out of the tavern and towards the final confrontation with a kitchen knife. She still never gave me that dress.<br/><br/>Joel plays a woman so disgraced that I won't even bother telling you her name*  -- she works with us at the inn. She got pregnant by a visiting stranger and then lost the baby, but that's probably for the best because it would have had a tail anyways -- at least that's what my mother said! The whole town is ashamed of her, but that only seems to make her prouder. Which is really frustrating, because she keeps distracting Kagematsu and trying to talk about her feelings (summary: she's upset) -- but even though he keeps putting up with her, sharing moments and smiling and saying nice things, it turns out Kagematsu really doesn't care about feelings (like mine, for example!) and just wants to get back to reading scrolls.<br/><br/>(* Actually I forgot her name. Sorry Joel!)<br/><br/>Harry plays "Lady Cherry Blossom," the village laundress. She is such a goody two-shoes, but also kind of pretty and desperate and sad. But who wouldn't be sad when Kagematsu keeps snubbing them, barely managing to offer a compliment even when she offers to cook him meals. Not only that, she snuck into the inn -- my home territory! -- and got into his room just long enough to mop his weary brow and take all her clothes off. I guess Kagematsu was interested in <i>those</i> scrolls because it turned out in the end that he loved Lady Cherry Blossom most of all -- something which he probably should have considered telling her, like when she begged him to save the village? Maybe then she wouldn't have killed herself during the shadow attack! Honestly, at first I thought that whole "doesn't talk much" thing was kind of mysterious, but maybe in the end it's not really the way to go!<br/><br/>Kagematsu did save the village though (just, just barely), it turned out the shadows were feeding on the water from the spring thaw, and so we drained all the hot springs and he did like fifteen hours of tai chi in a row and banished the shadow.<br/><br/>In the end I went off to become a shadow boxer myself (and hopefully find a sexy, considerate, younger Kagematsu look-alike who will be more interested in complimenting me and less interested in reading scrolls.) My mother took my insufferable sisters off to another town, and the Disgraced Lady took over our inn. Hopefully that'll work out for her.<br/><br/>A quote, after some particularly steamy scene-frame involving Kagematsu and the hot springs:<br/><br/>"Don't worry, Joel, we can ogle him in our minds..."<br/><i>[Dreamily]</i> "Yeah, it's our shared imagined space..."<br/><i>[Not-so-dreamily]</i> "... and it's getting HOT in there."<br/><br/><br/><b>Fuck Youth</b>, Sunday morning. When Jackson pitched this game I misheard it as "Fuck You" -- which persisted all the way until the end of the game. Fuck You would be a fine title regardless. This game was amazing, my highlight of the con, which I lack the energy to even summarize right now. Two of the four players had never played a story game before and so naturally their contributions, characters, and dialogue were the best, with me and Jackson struggling to keep up -- and forced to resort to the old standby, the Incredibly Awkward Teenage Seduction scene. The makeouts were brief but impactful.<br/><br/><b>Ribbon Drive</b>, Sunday afternoon. After some premeditation to secure McDaldno and Jacksno, I managed to ensure that I could play my favourite game at least once, and use up some of my mix backlog in the process. Alex and Angeline(?) joined us in the apocalypse cafe and after considerable deliberation (Alex ended up selecting my 'advanced Ribbon Drive' mix, which was then drawn -- it's <a href="RAbfwif1pcw" rel="nofollow">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLrnkK2YEcE" rel="nofollow">weird</a>) we told the story of an ad-hoc family of blood relatives, girlfriends and neighbours escaping the big city to try and start their lives over on an inherited farm. <br/><br/>The trip was enlivened by the endless fantasies of the world's most delusionally horny 12 year old (who had the Future: "I will lose my virginity to [my older brother's girlfriend, another PC, aged 22]"), squabbling between the perky, Internet-addicted optimistic and my third-world-problems-obsessed pre-med, and Holly (the girlfriend mentioned -- the brother in question was not on the trip) performing her amateur magic tricks. Things kind of went sideways, however, when two women at a rest stop recognized the 12-year old from a 'Missing' poster they had seen at a nearby restaurant, and it was subsequently revealed that his brother was not his legal guardian at all, and we were basically all engaged in a protracted form of child kidnapping. Mr. Kirk, the one-legged Iranian man who was the secret ingredient in our perfect storm of family, reconfirmed his commitment to his newly-adopted relatives and (I like to think) eventually led us safely past the police and into the promised chestnut glade.<br/><br/>Due to the slow start this game didn't quite manage to reach proper fruition, but the scenes of Holly (played by Alex) freaking out as she started to realize that she might be accidentally involved in a family kidnapping were particularly affecting, and as usual the game delivered that perfect mix of slow-paced road conversation, sudden drama, and listening-to-awesome-music that I have come to expect. <br/><br/>Plus afterwards Joe put on his unused mix and we had a 15 minute dance party in the apocalypse room, enthusing/scaring the occasional onlooker -- though I do believe we got a few people to join in by the end.<br/><br/><b>Sea MFing Dracula</b>, Sunday Night Gala. The post-Ribbon-Drive dance party turned out to be only a taste of things to come, a warm-up for the inevitable lawyerly triumph of Boss-A-Lot Ocelot in his quest to prove that it is Art itself -- rather than arsonists, tea candles, or Tupac -- that sets things on fire. But honestly I think that game needs its own thread, because holy shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean" title="rian_bean"><img alt="rian_bean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/311/nCMERNOS5J27N.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean">rian_bean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328072/#Comment_328072" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T15:40:48+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  3:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/><br/>A quote, after some particularly steamy scene-frame involving Kagematsu and the hot springs:<br/><br/>"Don't worry, Joel, we can ogle him in our minds..."<br/><i>[Dreamily]</i>"Yeah, it's our shared imagined space..."<br/><i>[Not-so-dreamily]</i>"... and it's getting HOT in there."<br/><br/></blockquote>\n<b>Yes!,</b> and<br/><br/>"Kagematsu is <i>sooo</i> dreamy"<br/>"I know, right?

Not much happens here -- unless you count barfights at The Winner's Circle Bar &amp; Grill -- but when you're a teenager, 'not much' is almost indistinguishable from 'the most important thing ever.'<br/><br/>I played Kansas, the teenage witch. (Yes, her parents named her that. No, not for good reasons.) For Kansas, things really have changed over the summer -- things like her mom going all psychotic on her philandering father, leading to divorce, kitchen knife attacks, restraining orders in all directions, and Kansas living at home with her nearly-catatonic mother. Little surprise then that she has abandoned her previously upstanding, preppy A+ ways and become the talk of the teenage town, a volatile mix of angst, anger, and sinister arcane power. Her pretend boyfriend dropped her -- "I just don't think we'd be able to get into the same <i>college</i>, anymore, you know?" -- and everything is just, like, fucked! okay?<br/><br/>I am sorry to admit that I cannot remember the name of the guy who played Robin, the Fey (if you're out there, sorry! I remember your face!) Robin was a true outcast, a trailer home kid to a single mom waitress whose nighttime wanderings had led him into the faerie kingdom, where he was adopted by the Fey. Almost all his friends were imaginary -- except for Sean, founding co-president and only other member of the Chess Club -- and he spent a lot of time being stuffed into lockers. Which probably explained how he figured out that his locker was actually a portal to The Abyss (making for convenient at-school gazing!) But now that it's senior year, Robin is trying to turn over a new leaf, and become more social -- which is totally going to work!<br/><br/>Candy played Eva Rose, the Vampire. Many ages old, smokin' hot, and way, way too cool for this town, Eva Rose was hiding from some very unfortunate people -- and what better place to hide than a shitty nobody town in Oregon? -- along with her extensive, fashionably retro wardrobe. As for the burning, age-old question of questions -- why, oh god why, would a 300 year old vampire want to attend high school? Well, <i>you'd</i> attend high school too if the music teacher, Mr. Kane, was hotter than a thousand fiery suns.<br/><br/>Jamie played James Chen, the "Quarterback". I mean, Infernal. James wanted a lot of things -- like, really really wanted them -- but unlike most teenagers he had the seemingly all-powerful 'Grandfather' in his corner, willing to provide them, no questions asked! Last year James really, really wanted to be good at football, and suddenly he was first team quarterback, with the social standing, letterman's jacket, and Cheerleader Girlfriend to prove it. Too bad Max, the ex-first-team-quarterback, is so jealous -- he really, really needs to just get out of the way.<br/><br/>This game was pretty awesome, with Hot rolls absolutely dominating the proceedings -- Candy's Vampire, despite moving through the school in a Mr.-Kane-obsessed haze, managed to parlay her highlighted +3 Hot into a truly stupendous amount of experience (I don't know if Carl kept track but it felt like it was 20+; by comparison, I managed to pick up my 5th right at the end of the game.) Her slow-motion, new-girl hallway walk-in started the first day of school off with a hormonal bang that just seemed to pick up more and more momentum as things continued.<br/><br/>It took Kansas all of half a day to break her promise to herself that she wouldn't freak out at school, cursing out some near-strangers in the cafeteria after browbeating Robin's 'friend' Sean into apologizing for an earlier Eva-Rose-jealousy-inspired lunchtray dump into Robin's lap. She immediately fled the scene to smoke outside, chewing herself out for confirming all the horrible summertime gossip that had spread about her and her family. Her outburst got James' attention, though, and when he came outside to talk to her it turned out that maybe he didn't really, really want that Cheerleader Girlfriend quite as much as he should -- the 7-9 results on 'Turn someone on' are really quite a piece of art. Some genuine concern followed by a well-timed "smoldering glance" resulted in a sudden, Kansas-initiated kiss -- right at the exact moment that the Cheerleader Girlfriend walks out the door. James' excuse? "<i>She</i> kissed <i>me!</i>" Kansas was too stunned by her own actions to bother making excuses.<br/><br/>This lead to the following exchange (paraphrased):<br/><br/>Carl (MC): "So Kansas, when you get back to your locker later, it seems like somebody has written something on it..."<br/>Me (Kansas): "Oh. Was it... 'beautiful, strong young girl?'"<br/>Carl (MC): "Well, yes, but for some reason they spelled it 'S', 'L', 'U', 'T'."<br/>Me (Kansas): "Isn't that a shame for them..."<br/><br/>Finally, a chance for some dark magic vengeance! (Sean had caved too easily earlier, and therefore escaped the doom.)<br/><br/>But first, she had to go smoke under the bleachers while that jerk James, who totally <i>tricked</i> her into kissing him somehow, used the football tryouts to get out some aggression -- on the ex-quarterback, Max, who had taken what should have been his seat in Math class earlier in the day. A +volatile roll later and Max is bleeding from the nose and probably concussed -- and who better to escort him to the school nurse than the new student, Eva Rose! Unfortunately for Max, Eva Rose gets confused: instead of taking him to the school nurse, she takes him to the locker room; and instead of stopping the bleeding with a kleenex, she stops it by removing all the blood from his young, sweaty body! But before Eva can cover for her accidental overfeeding, she hears footsteps and has to make a break for it.<br/><br/>This leaves James -- sent to the showers early, it's not like <i>he's</i> going to get cut from the team -- to discover (in the handicap stall of the boys' locker room washroom) the pale, bloodless corpse of the teammate he just smashed to the ground in a moment of who's-the-quarterback-now aggression. James freaks out, for obvious reasons overlooking any bite marks, and runs out to call the coach -- "Max is dead, Max is dead!" Soon the entire team, plus cheerleaders, are assembled in the locker room, surrounding the coach, who is resolutely but not optimistically administering CPR.<br/><br/>Things are not looking good for James, and much worse for Max. But this is not what James needs right now. And, after quite a bit of description of the scene and Max being dead, Jamie (James' player) suddenly looks up from reading his moves and says: "James really, really doesn't <i>want</i> Max to be dead." A string and a successful roll later, and Max suddenly sputters to life, all thanks to 'Grandfather'. Relief and confusion everywhere, and Max looks around, bewildered, before he seems to remember something. "That <i>bitch!</i>" Cut scene.<br/><br/>Some proper hexing followed -- a trip into Kansas' abyss, which consists of a memory-palace version of her family home, with her mother blankly watching TV and smoking in every single room, reveals that the Cheerleaders are a bunch of amateur-hour witches, carving the 'SLUT' into her locker with some sort of ritual dagger. Seriously? Losers. No amount of witchcraft is going to help Samantha recover from having all her hair fall out in the middle of the cafeteria. <br/><br/>Unfortunately play stopped at that point, because I am quite sure absolutely none of that would have turned out well. I left out quite a bit of play between Robin and Eva Rose and the jazz-playing, smoldering Mr. Kane, but suffice to say that had its moments as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328091/#Comment_328091" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T17:40:50+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  5:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 5:44PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Johnzo responds by confronting a murderous military coup of inexperienced knights with their own gullibility, watching them murder each other while trying to decide what to do, then<i>disinterring his ex-lover in order to wear his face as a mask</i>while walking through the city, raising the previously-murdered ruling class from the dead.</blockquote>\nLoved that Polaris game. So juicy.<br/><br/>And to be clear, that's Corvus (Johnzo's protagonist) raising the city elders who were slaughtered by the rebellious knights who thought they were doing his bidding, but who were really just betraying their oaths meaninglessly and undermining the values of their entire society -- which their would-be idol Corvus brutally pointed out to them, throwing them into near suicidal despair, in a beautifully liberal interpretation of "get things under control." The desperate-for-redemption knights were locked out of the city by the terrified People, and Corvus walked the streets alone, raising the murdered councilors, even though we had established in conflict that bringing the dead back to life <i>was the most horrible abomination the People could imagine.</i> Oh yeah.<br/><br/>Johnzo's answer to the whole "you're the only knight in the town, walking around doing necromancy in public as horrified citizens peek out at you from the windows" dilemma was: "well they saw what happened the last time someone crossed the knights" (pats his starlight sword) Dayyyyuum!<br/><br/>Eight experience checks in that final scene.

Daniel?<br/><br/>Maybe part of why I was creeped out was because we were in the candlelit dark forest with evil white mask guy behind us.<br/><br/>Interesting that the Chinese racism thing came up in the other thread, because I went out of my comfort zone to play James Chen, thinking about Robert Bohl's Misspent Youth advice. I know I said one thing that could definitely be taken the wrong way and cringed inwardly and hoped nobody noticed and quickly moved on, but might have made other mis-steps without even realizing. Mostly I deliberately tried to avoid stereotypes.<br/><br/>I was also guilty of stereotyping Candy. She did not look like a gamer but she was great.<br/><br/>I was also a whiny complainer about a couple calls Carl made--I've never had a GM play *that* hard on me before, and if I had been GM I would have backed down to a player like me--but Carl didn't back down and, in hindsight, he was so right, the game was so much better his way.<br/><br/>I've heard Monsterhearts pitched as being "like Twilight" but it was more like Carrie.

Kind of like the classical 'memory palace' technique for remembering lots of stuff. The problem was that along with all of that, every room* also contained her mother, sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the TV and chain smoking. I believe Carl asked me if her dad was anywhere in the house, and I said that sometimes she heard him talking in another room, but he was never there when she went in.<br/><br/>* I really do mean every room.

Candy here! (Eva Rose from Monsterhearts)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first post, this weekend was the first time I played a story game. I have been only playing 'real' board games for about a year w Frank's monthly Danger Room game day. Other than that I do pretty well at Scrabble, w avg scores of 400+ and an online rating of about 1850.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only found out about the convention a couple of days before when Frank sent out an email. I was very excited! I love the Species studio and was thrilled to see that installations were being set up. For better or worse I did no research other than checking out the Fabricated Realities website.<br/>\n<br/>\njdfristrom wrote: I was also guilty of stereotyping Candy. She did not look like a gamer but she was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the compliment - that makes me feel great! I do not look like a gamer - 48 and not so hip looking any more - but I have to say I felt very welcome by all who I interacted w. I was a tiny bit nervous coming into a situation where I did not know anyone! Or even much about the culture I was visiting. Everyone was great though! Ben and Ross were most welcoming as were Brendan and Seth who I joined in playing Galaxy Trucker and Dominion w when our game of Microscope did not work out. Also thanks to David, I think, who gave me a ride home! I had a great time - it was really good to get out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to jd for admitting the stereotyping....I am a bit used to being judged  - just by being a woman who was hot by society's standards and then when I did the whole punk rock thing....in 1981 I was the only punk in my high school... and then a major scenester in my time in NY...now I am disabled w chronic pain and in some ways have become invisible....and a bit used to being put in a different box - even by my 12 year old daughter -  who does not know me as a 'cool' person, just mom! She is constantly surprised at my stories but not that impressed by my namedropping....she thinks I don't know how to use makeup! ha ha!<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring this up a bit because I think it relates a lot to Monsterhearts. Once I got home I immediately went online to make sense of the experience and the materials for Monsterhearts stress the need for teenagers to come to terms w their bodies, for skins to pass as mortals as a metaphor for the alienation and confusion all teens feel as they experience very powerful emotions for the first time, both about and w/in their own bodies and about others (and their bodies). So I think that this was an interesting point that came up. "Passing" is a theme for the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that during the game I was a bit confused as to the "purpose." What was our goal? How did we determine a winner? Were we supposed to kill all the other players? I did not really have much strategy as I did not understand some of these points. Yet in my ignorance I did accumulate way more experience than other players! jd WAS right about that! <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to just go w the flow and be creative. The four+ hours pretty much flew by! We were barely getting to some really good action when midnight came. Alas, I had to go, my ride was patient as we finished up but I was a bit anxious to not make him wait as he was going to Seattle....so I have a bit of a sense of everything left hanging.  I can see how this could easily be continued at another session and kind of wish I had that opportunity. I left the building happy and energized but a bit confused as to what just happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not until I read the rules and had some time to think about things that the impact really began to hit me....and I began to 'get it.' It is also interesting to read what others have to say about the game. Was the creator at the conference?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really did have a great piece of fiction going! Like a good book or tv series, I was left hanging, I REALLY want to know what happened next....had I not had to leave I think I could have easily played another 2 hours....we really were just getting to the meatier parts of the story w Eva alone w Robin, who had just discovered her secret and is desperate to experience Eva feeding on him. They were in Sean's cool wheels on their way to see Mr. Kane at the Winner's Circle [love that name!]. Mr. Kane was then confronting Eva....what would have happened? Oh! (BTW Mr. Kane was based on a crush I had for awhile on David Kane - I always joked about marrying him so I could fulfill my stripper name as Mrs. Candy Kane. And he does have a cool jazzy lounge act called Them Jazzbeards, they are awesome, doing soundtracks for your drinking - search online...I was lost at coming up w names! I blanked! Eva is my cat's name - Eva Catgoria after the famous actress. Rose is my daughter's middle name.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, re the above, I had pictured Eva being thinner, not super thin but 'normal' - now I wish I had made her be heavier and still have the HOT factor that was attracting all the guys esp James....I am disappointed Eva never got to get closer to James and Kansas for that matter....I think had she been heavier and was still casting this spell, the other girls in the story, esp Samantha, Jame's head cheerleader girlfriend would have been further riled up and incited to doing bad things to Eva. How could he/they be attracted to a FAT girl over me? Kansas and Eva had some sort of moment before our action started where Kansas offered herself to Eva as part of the backstory. I think they could have had a complex relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved the way Brian played Robin! He was very sweet! And jd was great as Jamie - a couple of times I brought up the idea of racism against his character but we did not seem to need to go there. I think he did play him against type. ice cream emperor was a fine Kansas and Carl was good at provoking things, coming up w some good twists. I would be happy to story play w any of you again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder, had I read the rules ahead of time, how that would have impacted my play? I am not sure. I think it would have helped to have had more context into what we were supposed to be doingl....some sort of written tutorial on the goals and structure of the activity would have helped me make sense of it and perhaps play stronger. You may want to consider this for the future for us RPG stars in embryo....maybe expand on the description that is already on the website and in the book. (BTW - very cool to have the book!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe space was fabulous! I love spending time at the Species studio, working on our costumes and we go there for other reasons too like when we worked on the Olympia Rafah Mural Project (name drop - my daughter has a leaf on it and we worked a bit on the first phases). It is comfortable for me there, at home, but it was nice to see the installations and I would love to help w that next year. I think the space one was my favorite. I think we played Monsterhearts in the enchanted forest (?) and it was a nice setting for the story - dark w candles and the body parts of animals w their bones exposed....a goal of our game! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a funny wa wa wa moment playing Dominion. Brendan had the 200+ cards all neatly set up on the table and was - luckily - still in the midst of explaining the A(ction), B(uy) and C(leanup)s of the game when the table collapsed sending almost all of the cards to the floor....glad it was not me! Luckily the spilled coffee did not hurt the game and we used our combined superior hand eye coordination to remedy the situ fairly rapidly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to playing more games, story and board. I am in Oly on the East Side, I have room to play here and have a pretty flexible schedule. I can be contacted at candy@candio.com I am also on Fbook, search candio.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all who worked so hard to organize another great Olympia activity. may there be future conventions! Thanks to all who participated too, the intelligence and creativity in the room was astounding. I was pleased to see so many women too! At the 7 o'clock SAT night census it was almost even w maybe 5-10 more guys than ladies in a crowd of 60 or so? A women only game night could be interesting....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/candio" title="candio"><img alt="candio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/candio">candio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328118/#Comment_328118" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T22:40:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One last comment....this is from the web site of the designer of Monsterhearts and it has helped me put things into context...that is what the goal is, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\u2019re for all the sketchy punks who would rather reclaim storytelling than let some impersonal man behind some impersonal screen write their media for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328119/#Comment_328119" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T22:52:11+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 10:57PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wow. thank you for sharing this candy!

The last part of our game kind of split into two pairs of PCs, but I am confident that if we had had time to continue that would have changed again. Kansas certainly wanted to know more about the cooler-than-this-town new kid. There were so many different directions the Kansas/Eva relationship could have gone, given the backstory elements and their respective personalities -- I would also love to see what would happen in a longer-term game when Eva inevitably 'got over' Mr. Kane (well, in the shortened version he turned out to be a vampire as well, but I suspect that was more for convenience's sake.) Would she bother staying in high school, because of the other connections she'd made? Etc. There was a lot of potential in all directions, really, which is of course a sign of a good game.<br/><br/>And I wanted to say that I really appreciated the post on your general experience, and your reflections on some of the issues the game brought up for you. I played a lot -- like, a LOT, I think 4 different games' worth -- of teenage characters this weekend, and I think there's a reason that game designers and players often return to that general age. Also, I could tell a bit as we were playing that you were somewhat unsure about where to go with the game, or as you say what the goal was, but I think you did a good job of just following what's in front of you -- whether it was what was going on in the story, or what was marked on your character sheet. You were definitely an experience-generating machine -- but that also meant that Eva Rose herself kept taking actions and pushing the story forward.<br/><br/>Also, I've been doing this for many years and I'm <i>still</i> terrible at coming up with names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328128/#Comment_328128" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T23:55:27+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 11:55PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Not much happens here ... but when you're a teenager, 'not much' is almost indistinguishable from 'the most important thing ever.'</blockquote>\nThat's a lovely quote! And that was a lovely game, as were the other two Monsterheart games, and I would have liked to see a lot more of all those characters. Apocalypse World is the same way; they're both intended for campaign play so in four hours things are getting really good just as it's time to say goodbye.

Many, many thanks to Ross and Jackson and Grace and all the artists who made such an amazing place, the volunteers who manned the door, and all the players both experienced and new.<br/><br/>The art installations were SO amazing. I especially adored the Dark Forest setting. (I should have brought Summerland to run!) I ran 4 of my 7 games in it, including Saturday evening Monsterhearts by candlelight with the help of a flashlight and one spotlight Ross helpfully rigged like a full moon. Saturday afternoon I ran Monsterhearts for the first time ever, and liked it so much I ran it twice more. I felt very privileged to run it for the artist who created the Dark Forest, Ryan C. I ran Don't Rest Your Head (Dark Forest edition) once. Aaron T, the artist who created the adjacent outer space setting, played in that.<br/><br/>The other 3 games were in the Safari Circle, surrounded comfortably by large animals: Fiasco Suburbia and two games of Lacuna. I didn't run Apocalypse World so I didn't use the Apocalypse Bar, but it was very cool too. The Castle in the Sky room had no chairs, just a soft fluffy cloud to sit on, so I did not run "Lacuna: Castle in the Sky" there, because I wanted to use my knees later. Jackson T ran "Walking with Halcion" using that setting, because he rocks like that.<br/><br/>How scheduling worked for me: Friday afternoon's Lacuna was arranged in advance when Morgan S emailed me before the convention, and Saturday afternoon's Monsterhearts was set up on request when someone asked me Friday to run for its author, Joe Macdaldno (no pressure). Friday morning's Fiasco was run in a 3-hour slot for two of the Lacuna players since we all showed up early. Saturday morning I slept in.<br/><br/>The other 4 slots were filled via the Facilitator Roll Call by the Mushroom King, which worked very well for the number of people we had. A drawback to the FRCbtMK is that each Facilitator/GM announced one game, although I was ready to run any of 11 I'd brought (Apocalypse World, Best Friends, Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Lose Your Edge, Don't Push Your Luck, Don't Rest Your Head, Dreaming Crucible, Fiasco, Lacuna, Monsterhearts, and last-minute addition Puppetland). For the Sunday afternoon slot the Mushroom King asked if anyone had something they really wanted to play but hadn't had the chance to yet, and F/GM's stepped up to run as many of those as they could, which was great. The Mushroom Kings worked hard to make sure everyone got into something they wanted.<br/><br/><i>"Monsterhearts is a game of smalltown teens and monsters toying with their hearts and bodies. It's an exploration of the human condition, like the Donner Party was an exploration of a way across the Rockies."</i><br/><br/>The playspace was a very nice balance of enough people around to feel companionable, but far enough apart that noise levels were excellent. The location was perfect, across the street from a hotel and within blocks of a Farmer's Market, more than a dozen good places to eat, a game and comic store (The Danger Room), a book store, and a tattoo parlor for all one's space bear needs. There was an excellent little booklet handed out with a map showing what was where.<br/><br/>The schedule was good. Morning game 10-1, an hour for lunch, afternoon game 2-6. Officially dinner was 6-7, and there was supposed to be a 7pm-10pm slot and a 10-2am slot, but in practice I think it worked more like games got underway around 8pm and went to midnight give or take. A few diehards gamed until 2am.<br/><br/>There were snacks and drinks and water for sale (to help support the con), and I much appreciated not having to leave the venue to keep hydrated.<br/><br/>Sea Dracula requires its own thread, or possibly Youtube channel. Congratulations to Boss-A-Lot Ocelot on a hard-danced victory over Jackson Gerbil, Fox Mulder, and Savior-of-the-City Kangaroo. Joel also did his best to destroy Animal City in an amazing Boss Fight. After Justice was ummm... seen to, there was more live music, plus much talking in the alley outside, plus a late night walk to Jake's Hot Dogs with bonus street scene. Mmm, chili cheese tater tots.<br/><br/>There were way too many good bits to try to cover them all, including the most heartbreaking "What Just Happened?" opening scene in the dozens of times I've run DRYH. Ross and Jackson know an amazing number of cool and interesting people. It was especially great to hear people who played, then talking about running games themselves in the future. Possibly I should have explained roleplaying better ("It's exploring the human condition, with dice"), but mostly I just threw all my players into the deep water and watched them fly. My thanks to all 21 of them, and my regrets to everyone I didn't get the chance to game with because of the tyranny of math.<br/><br/>I'm posting this from Portland on my way to the bay area, but my heart is still back in the Dark Forest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX" title="EnricPDX"><img alt="EnricPDX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX">EnricPDX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328131/#Comment_328131" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T00:30:20+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 12:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 9:29PM by EnricPDX.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I only took a few photos of the different realities, and no photos at all of the games, but you can find what I have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054444@N08/sets/72157626905001562/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As far as Jason's question about the environments, I'm afraid I don't have much to add to what's already been said. I agree that this past weekend really illustrated what a subtle but powerful role our physical environments have on our play. I guess the more intimate, personal, and creatively invested-in a space is, the easier it is for me to relax and give myself over to the act of imagining a little more completely. Conversely, the more sterile and impersonal a space, the harder it is to get to that internal place. And I think that goes for creative endeavors in general - I mean, I feel like I prefer house cons to playing in hotels or game stores for the same reason that I prefer house shows to bars when I go to see music. With that in mind, having something like Fabricated Realities, something that is larger in scale but still preserves that feeling of being handmade and human and warm - well, that seems like something unique.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I mentioned earlier, I had a wonderful time. I arrived a little before the Friday afternoon slot, and quickly found my way into an InSpectres game that Ben was running, along with Tori, Alex, and Joelle. We decided that our InSpectres were a group of 1940s-era teen sleuths - The Providence Rhode Island Teen Friends of the Beyond Committee - investigating the case of some mysterious singing that we heard late at night in the condemned old library. Alex and Joelle had never role-played before, but they jumped right in, and were tossing out ideas like old pros from the word go. I feel like I flubbed the final clue a little - sorry about that! - but it was still a great time.<br/><br/>In the evening, Joe was kind enough to facilitate The Quiet Year for Morgan, Orion, Tori, and myself, which Tori mentioned earlier, and which I'd really been looking forward to trying out. Ours was apparently the most gonzo of Quiet Years, but everyone was having A LOT of fun. Um, we also actually weren't the quietest of Quiet Years, either - Carl, if we disrupted your DRYH game at all, I apologize. When we finished, Daniel and Joe and I played a few games of Dominion, and, man, I consider myself a passable Dominion player, but Joe clobbered me. My hat is off to you, sir!<br/><br/>On Saturday morning, I played GXB, facilitated by Ross, with Peter (I think) as Momoko, and Marcy, Danielle (I think), and myself as her three suitors. GXB was a perfect morning game, I think - a little on the shorter side, and kind of relaxed and funny, which was great for when people were still a little groggy. After we finished, I played a game of 7 Wonders with Brendan, Lesley, and Lukas, and then wandered off to find food.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, I facilitated Kagematsu for Daniel, Grace, Joel, Tori, and myself, of which Daniel gave a pretty thorough rundown upthread. Kagematsu is good as fuck, and I'm always happy to play it, though our session ran a little over, and I was definitely getting a little antsy toward the end - hopefully everyone still had a good time!<br/><br/>For my final slot, I got a Fiasco game together with John, Marcy, and Tori, using the McMurdo Station playset. Man, what a reliably fun game! I named my character after a guy that was an asshole to me in junior high, and he ended up shot in the leg, burnt up in a meth lab mishap, and rejected by the love of his life, so... there's that.<br/><br/>After that, I hung out for a few more hours, and then caught my bus back to Portland. I really wish that I could have stuck around for Sunday, and especially for Sea Dracula - I'm definitely planning on coming back up next year! Like I mentioned before, many thanks to the organizers and volunteers that kept things going, and also to everyone that I played with and hung out with - you were all amazing! Special thanks to Jackson for letting me crash at his place at the last minute, and to Tori for playing in almost every game I was in over the weekend. Now I've got to turn in, though - I'm still operating on a little bit of a sleep deficit. Hopefully I'll see everyone at GPNW!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328134/#Comment_328134" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T01:01:52+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:01AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EnricPDX</cite>The Providence Rhode Island Teen Friends of the Beyond Committee</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EnricPDX</cite>For my final slot, I got a Fiasco game together with John, Marcy, and Tori, using the McMurdo Station playset.

I'm sorry if I stretched the game with my incessant demands for more narration prior to dice rolls!

Anyway, I was a little nervous when I showed up, but everyone was way chill and inviting. It was laidback between games, with hardcore, motivated gaming during the sessions.

Good times.<br/><br/><b>Friday 2-6</b>, Session is classified. (Carl Rigney does a great Senior Agent Snyder though.)<br/><br/><b>Friday 7-10ish</b>. Play-tested The Quiet Year with (Orion Canning), Tori (rian_bean) and (EnricPDX). Joe McDaldno observed. I did a terrible job of reading the text, but we were able to work through the rules quickly. AP coming. <br/><br/><b>Saturday 10-1</b>. The Dreaming Crucible with Tori (rian_bean) and Joel (Joel). I got to be the Dark Fairy. Most. Fun. Ever. We had a great story about a physically abused boy who jumps out his window.

I was excited to play Microscope with Ben Robbins, but due to the excess players I ended up running it for Alex and Reid. We explored \u201cThe Shattering of the Crystal Empire\u201d based on a little figure hanging up in the space-themed play area. I wish I had a picture of him. Anyway, it turns out that a giant space jellyfish drops a moon on them at the behest of the Blind Ones. Who knew?

But try as I might, Rowena (Megann) continued to elude my clutches and grow her secret society of Guerilla Gardeners. Reid played an arsonist/food critic (may the restaurant that serves bland soup be warned) and Joe was a libidinous priest of Abigail who got away with murder.<br/><br/><b>Sunday 2-6</b>. I guilt-tripped Ben Robbins into running Microscope again with Orion and Marcus. We really had to twist his arm.

I think Joe should probably consider adding that to the official rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I left my heart @ Fabricated Realities - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14420/i-left-my-heart-fabricated-realities/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="I left my heart @ Fabricated Realities - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14420/i-left-my-heart-fabricated-realities/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: TylerTthat looks like what burning man should be instead of what burning man is.

Once I got home I immediately went online to make sense of the experience and the materials for Monsterhearts stress the need for teenagers to come to terms w their bodies, for skins to pass as mortals as a metaphor for the alienation and confusion all teens feel as they experience very powerful emotions for the first time, both about and w/in their own bodies and about others (and their bodies). So I think that this was an interesting point that came up. "Passing" is a theme for the game.<br/><br/>I will admit that during the game I was a bit confused as to the "purpose." What was our goal? How did we determine a winner? Were we supposed to kill all the other players? I did not really have much strategy as I did not understand some of these points. Yet in my ignorance I did accumulate way more experience than other players! jd WAS right about that!</blockquote>\nCandy, thanks for sharing your experience in so much depth. It is really cool to see your play experience contextualized in all these different ways!<br/><br/>Some story games are much clearer in their "point" than Monsterhearts is. I've started joking that the goal of the game is to "win at high school," but I haven't stumbled upon a really great statement of purpose yet.<br/><br/>I think that the point of the game is largely about inhabiting the skin of someone scared and angry and young. It takes place at a scary time in one's life: when it is absolutely vital that they have their own agency, but absolutely true that they're going to fuck it up. And the game is definitely played for messy, sexy kicks... but at the same time, I think that it approaches teen issues with a type of sincerity - it's only by incorporating vampires and strings and Darkest Selves into the mix that we even begin to develop a vocabulary for understanding these people.<br/><br/><br/>Candy, what was it like playing Monsterhearts as the mother of a girl on the brink of being a teenager?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328261/#Comment_328261" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:06:00+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite>the tyranny of math</blockquote>\nThis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328264/#Comment_328264" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:11:54+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite><b>Friday 7-10ish</b>.

Who?", and then sit back and watch silently as the game unfolded.<br/><br/>And I thought you did a great job of reading and facilitating the game, especially since you were approaching it blind. I only stepped in to point out/interpret three brief things, which felt pretty successful for me: that Sketching The Terrain meant literally drawing pictures (something that the text was fuzzy about), that Discussions didn't end in decisions (which the text omitted altogether, by accident), and that at one point a Discussion broke the length rules.<br/><br/>It was great to see your feral child community struggle to define itself in the face of some weird issues - drunk dad, the ghost, contentions about burial rites, the nearby army base.

Enveloped in that aura of inspiration and goodwill, how could the games NOT be amazing?<br/><br/>Of course, the games did overtly inspire fiction, as well. My second Dreaming Crucible game in the Crystal Cave, which Drew described above, was the most direct, with banquets of bejeweled fruit in the stone-king's hall, and our hero's painful memories extracted in the form of gems and preserved in a vault. In my first Crucible, in the Dark Forest, if I had been playing the Dark Faerie (and not been sitting with my back to it), you can BET that the Nemesis would have resembled the creepy fellow pictured upthread! In our Monsterhearts game on Sunday, everyone had deep spiritual ties to the forest. And of course Apocalypse World in the Apocalypse cafe was great. I think the setting definitely influenced the kind of Apocalypse we had--all urban with desperate communities struggling in a war-zone environment.<br/><br/>I had the privilege of playing with no less than three artists in the space they created: Grace in The Organ, Eric in the Apocalypse Cafe, and Ryan in the Dark Forest. That was great. Again, I don't think it had an overt influence on play, but it was just a great mutual creative vibe to be able to honor the spaces they made by playing with them. Especially since some of them (like Ryan) had played little or no story games before! And rocked it hard, I might add.<br/><br/>On that note, I want to say it's wonderful to see and hear of so many people new to these games jumping into the deep end and having fun. Candy, Your story is touching and exciting, thanks for sharing it. it's wonderful to see all the different ways that story flows into life, and life into story. (damn, I wish I'd thought of that sentence when the interview folks were asking me "so what does storygaming mean to you?"<br/><br/>Another amazing thing that I saw this weekend: gender parity. Seriously, from informal observation I'd guess that the male to female attendance was about even. I've never seen that, evan at, say, Go Play NW which is a very ladyfriendly con. I'm so excited to see Ross, Jackson, Grace and crew making a space where women feel included, a place where they actuaslly want to go, free of boys' club mentality or the "nerd den" ambiance of a lot of public gaming spaces and events. It really tickled me to see Kagematsu, a game that was practically written <i>because</i> women are so rare in the scene, get more female players than it's "supposed to." I hope to see this trend continue throughout our scene.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328342/#Comment_328342" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T18:36:58+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  6:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>The spaces created by the artists lent themselves to shared imagining, not so much because they overtly inspired the fiction, but because they generated this ambient feeling that<i>here is where art happens.</i></blockquote>\nThis is the key for me.

I couldn't come Friday and weather-wise, Saturday was one of the first non wrist-slitters we've had since probably September and I just couldn't make myself go inside and game all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Sunday it was, and for the afternoon session to boot. (You guys can game at 10 a.m.? Seriously?! Impressive...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first got there (like 1:30) or so), it was kind of weird because there wasn't really too many people around, just the dying embers of one game with most folks out having lunch. So I just sort of sat around, fidgeting, not really knowing anybody and waiting for something to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't have to fidget too long 'cuz shortly after 2p, somebody (Jackson?) climbed the aforementioned mushroom and got things going. Since I basically only had one game to play for the whole freakin' con, my goals were simple: Play something I'd heard of and play something cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way things shook out, it was going to be either Polaris or Microscope. Mission accomplished!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I ended up playing Microscope with Ben, Orion and Morgan, accomplished and generous role-players all three of them. Ben's practiced explanatory patois made things easy for me to pick up and the game took -- as promised -- many unexpected twists and turns. Microscope is a bloody idea factory, is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to sum up: One session just isn't enough. Aside from my cool table-mates, there were all these other people I got to only fleetingly meet and who all seemed like they would be fun to game with. Next year, more! Much, much more. Also, welcome, everybody to our cool, somewhat hidden little burgh. I thought it was pretty awesome that y'all big-city types came down here to the hinterlands.

Actually, I'm going through a bit of withdrawal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat an amazing group of energetic people who became instantly tight!  So friendly that I actually assumed a group of strangers were my housemate's long-term friends.<br/>\n"So how long have you known Bridget &amp; Xander?"<br/>\n"Uh, since about 20 minutes before we went to dinner."<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that many people imagined in terms of cinematography, whereas I described my scenes as I would tell a real-life story and imagined them as I would a book.  It initially threw me when people broke into my mental image with talk of the camera zooming in or by describing the end credits. You'd think after years of volunteering at the Olympia Film Society, I'd think this in this manner, but apparently not. Maybe I should start including dedications, chapter titles, and footnotes in my own descriptions just to see how others react to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighlights:<br/>\n"You've been trained, remember the 3 Bs!"<br/>\n"Um...Of course!

Oh wait, that was during a lunch break.  Can we work that into the official schedule for next year?<br/>\n<br/>\nA huge thanks to Ross, Jackson, and Grace for organizing, and to everyone for making it such a fun event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328382/#Comment_328382" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T22:45:21+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 10:45PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marcy</cite>Maybe I should start including dedications, chapter titles, and footnotes in my own descriptions just to see how others react to that.</blockquote>\nAwesome!<br/><br/>(Now I want to remix Ribbon Drive to use a poetry anthology instead of a mix tape.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean" title="rian_bean"><img alt="rian_bean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/311/nCMERNOS5J27N.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean">rian_bean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328385/#Comment_328385" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T23:04:08+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 11:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 11:06PM by rian_bean.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marcy</cite><br/>The Sandwich Game was successfully playtested.

I also have taken morphine for 7 years now...that is a stigma that places me far outside of society....I have been stigmatized by those in the medical culture as well as addicts...(I am dependent but not an addict - big difference).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd getting old, as a woman, I have mentioned, you do become invisible in a way that you are not when you are young and attractive. Just being yourself, walking down the street, you get noticed and commented on - either in positive ways - catcalls or negative - let's say barking noises...depending on how you chose to dress that day - look hot and get hassled, dress down and get hassled.

We really had to twist his arm. Our history included a naturalist aesthetic movement that was strict but definitely NOT NAZI. It was corrupted and overthrown by Atheistic Art Anarchists. Dragons were made out of secret math.</blockquote>\nAt Fabricated Realities, how could we _not_ make a game about art transforming society? I mean, really?<br/><br/>For people who claimed not to have played many story games (Orion, your first story game was Friday I believe, and Marcus I think you said you'd only played a few story games before and had a long hiatus from role-playing) you guys played like seasoned pros. Lots of fantastic ideas (dude, math as a language? creating new life from equations drawn on a chalkboard?) and lots of very real character moments.<br/><br/>I think my favorite scene was young mason Davin wooing his wife-to-be. The Question was "what belief does she hold that Davin just can't understand" -- yep, sowing the seeds of trouble. Earlier in the game (but decades in the future) we'd seen an older, wearier Davin forced to tear down the cathedral-like city hall he'd spent years crafting, block by polished block, because of the new religious doctrine that only natural things were beautiful, so any art that didn't imitate nature was heretical. Now we were jumping back in time to Davin as a young man (played by Morgan), bashfully revealing the sculpture he'd made of his would-be sweetheart (Marcus), while her painter brother (Orion) intruded on the picnic like any good third wheel. I loved the slow pace and really awkward interactions between Davin, the big lug, and the girl, who was so clearly wiser and carefully trying to explain bigger ideals to him without hurting his feelings. Loved it and it cast the whole earlier scene in a totally richer light.<br/><br/>I also loved the whole irony that the followers of the "goddess of art" were really the ones suppressing art freedom and demanding it fit natural ideals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>\u201cThis event is titled \u2018The Mutha Fuckin\u2019 Coup\u2019\u201d.</blockquote>\nRules addendum: this is now a mandatory part of all Microscope histories.<br/><br/>I lost count of how many Microscope games there were at FabReal. People would say, "oh yeah, we played Microscope" and I would just kind of stare at them like when your dog hears the answering machine talking. I played two, and I'm pretty sure there were four others (two on Friday facilitated by Ross &amp; Jackson that I know nothing about, the Crystal Empire Morgan mentioned, plus one Johnzo did Saturday night. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamemage/5803400431/in/photostream" rel="nofollow">I snuck a picture</a> when they weren't looking.

We decided that our InSpectres were a group of 1940s-era teen sleuths - The Providence Rhode Island Teen Friends of the Beyond Committee - investigating the case of some mysterious singing that we heard late at night in the condemned old library. Alex and Joelle had never role-played before, but they jumped right in, and were tossing out ideas like old pros from the word go. I feel like I flubbed the final clue a little - sorry about that! - but it was still a great time.</blockquote>\nI loved the whole Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew meets Breakfast Club vibe. Each of the kids was from totally different walks of life (society girl all the way to homeless orphan) but despite some carefully maintained facades, none of them really had anywhere else that they fit in. None of them wanted to admit it, but these were the only really friends they had -- in fact every one of them bitterly denied it at different points of the game, lying their little hearts out.<br/><br/>They would meet at their secret clubhouse, an old abandoned railroad car, because of course none of them would want to be seen together normally...<br/><br/>As for wrapping up the mystery, you didn't flub anything Harry! That can be a sticky bit of InSpectres since you're trying to integrate all the revelations, but really I think we were far more interested in the characters and their relationships than the mystery, a choice I will take every day of the week and twice on Sunday. We spent the whole half-time huddle with the kids exchanging hilarious barbs. For instance:<br/><br/><i>"There's a lot to do in my room..."</i> -introverted bookworm Calvin Frost (Harry), totally lying<br/><br/><i>"Don't touch me you dirty hobo!"</i> -Viv (Alex), bonding with her teammate Jack the homeless orphan boy (Joelle). We blew the whistle on LARPing.<br/><br/><i>"Other than filing papers for incorporation, I didn't tell anyone about our secret club. How else could I order matching blazers?"</i> -Bunny (Tori), a society girl who has her priorities straight, also solving the mystery of why the club only has a nickel left<br/><br/><i>"Maybe you can bring the truth, Viv"</i> -Bunny, planning missions and tired of evasions. Or maybe because everyone else is bringing potato salad<br/><br/><i>"He has kind of a lady-howl..."</i> -Harry, solving the mystery<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamemage/5803400751/in/photostream/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2381/5803400751_8fe54ba84b_m.jpg"/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamemage/5803399513/in/photostream" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/5803399513_453428916a_m.jpg"/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamemage/5803954318/in/photostream" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5146/5803954318_f3a8c64a22_m.jpg"/></a><br/></div><br/><br/>And yeah, Joelle and Alex: that was your first role-playing game <i>ever?</i> Dudes.

You couldn't have made it easier to step into. I've taken the idea of using it as a world-building tool for other games to heart. From just the two microscope games I played we came up with such idea-rich settings. I have to take a minute to describe the other game we played with Johnstone.<br/><br/>It started out as the history of a group of Zooaphages who were fleeing persecution from tyranical vegans to form their own colony. To whit they built a spaceship noah's ark filled with animals they would use to replace their new worlds wildlife and have plenty of animals to eat. Tragically, Beltran, the zoologist in charge of the animals on the ark, selectively sterilized any species that would provide any competition with humans as dominant predators on the new planet, including felines, canines, primates, and flightless birds (just in case they tried to evolve back into raptors). He became the head proponent of the domestication party, whose opposing party wanted to let the animals roam wild and hunt them. After Beltran\u2019s party lost, Beltran was tried and found guilty of \u201cscrewing everything up\u201d, with his longtime assistant Jamal narcing on him for the good of society. Because of Beltran\u2019s genetic tampering  the range free prey animals did not benefit from the effect of predators weeding out the weak through \u201cnatural selection\u201d, which led to a weakening immune system. An alien virus was then able to evolve to infect land animals and slowly wipe them out.<br/><br/>Unable to come up with a cure, a large group of people founded underwater cities where they could subsist off undersea life that was unaffected by the virus, which couldn\u2019t survive underwater. Because they had very little children with them and a large generation gap, they created clones to populate their underwater cities. The clones genetic engineering and unique upbringing made them very foreign to the original undersea colonists, and they eventually organized to take over the leading council. This led to my favorite scene where the council\u2019s head of science(played by me) tried to convince Maria, the geneticist who created the clones (played by Johnstone), to disclose their DNA records so the council could target their DNA with a virus to wipe them out. Otherwise the clones, who were genetically modifying themselves further to adapt to underwater life, would end up replacing humanity and the original humans would die out. Maria\u2019s daughter (played by ben) tried to convince her mother that this was wrong and that maybe the clones, who she had grown up with, should be in charge after all. Maria brought out the genetic codes, only to delete them at the last moment, thus stopping the clones from modifying themselves further and taking away the possibility of the virus.<br/><br/>The clones were eventually able to figure out how to give themselves gills anyways, and went on to form an underwater society which harvested kelp and livestock in undersea farms. The last of the land dwellers, whose lives had become harsh and brutal during the gradual extinction of all the transplanted land animals, turned to piracy for subsistence. They sacked and looted undersea farms, enslaving the \u201cgills\u201d and becoming feudalistic overlords. The gills organized and began a war against the \u201cland pirates\u201d, becoming a warrior society. To end the war they formed a plan to wipe out the land dwellers with a two pronged attack, coating the surface of the sea around pirate ships with napalm to burn them, and seeding underwater volcanoes to raise the water levels and destroy their coastal cities. Lastly, the water dwellers fell to a slow societal decline and genetic decay of their cloned DNA, leading to the extinction of the last of the colonists.<br/><br/>Now, who wouldn\u2019t want to play a game set during the final battles between the land pirates and the \u201cgills\u201d?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328930/#Comment_328930" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T22:41:54+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 10:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games played:<br/><br/><a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/games/" rel="nofollow"><b>The Dreaming Crucible</b></a> in the <i><span style="color: #006600;">Dark Forest</span></i> with Tori and Morgan. Morgan's handily describing the game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=328230" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>. It was a wonderful session, and it was actually a beautiful act of trust to hand off Dark Faerie duties (which can be a little facilitator-y) to Morgan, who really wanted it. And he nailed it, too. As did Tori, playing the Hero. They had a really great and naturalistic dysfunctional family dynamic pre-fairy-quest, and during the journey created a compelling pair of ideologies in the war for young Derek's heart.<br/><br/><b>Kagematsu </b>in <i><span style="color: #FF0000;">The Organ</span></i> with Grace, Harry, Daniel and Tori. As masterfully described by Le Empereur de Ice Creme, we all threw ourselves at Grace's bookish Kagematsu, to (almost) no avail. Motherfucker was just NOT having the drama! This game, combined with Monsterhearts later on, showed me some fascinating things about player agency as it relates to romance and gender roles, in the grip of the Frickin' Unwelcome. I think I feel a blog post coming on. I found out later that Grace had designed the organ, which was rad.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b> in the <i><span style="color: #666666;">Apocalypse Cafe</span></i> with Noah, Orion, Eric and ???. I MC'ed at Ross' request since his voice was shot, and of COURSE the guy (Eric) who designed the Apocalypse World Cafe needs to play Apocalypse World in it. It was a fun session, with Maestro D' Silver (Orion) running a roving theater showing preserved films from Before with his Battlebabe security chief Damson, and the Hoarder Artimouse (Eric) who supplies electronic equipment. The Touchstone Alonzo(???) is trying to band folks together into a solid community. He likes the Night Theater for its community-building qualities, and because they show socialist propaganda films, but dislikes the vice and corruption it attracts. After some shenanigans over Artimouse's lust for the shiny Glock Damson's hapless sidekick Dustwich just acquired, Silver took his peeps to meet with the Madame and crimelord, Dragon Lady, who's displeased with some of the Night Theater's films breaking her porn monopoly. Silver having blown his manipulate roll when sending a letter to request negotiation, the meet was a trap, which went badly--for Dragon lady! Poor Jeanette, though, she wanted nothing more than to fuck Damson raw...too bad she had such a bitch for a boss!<br/><br/><b>Dreaming Crucible</b> in the <i><span style="color: #00FFFF;">Crystal Cavern</span></i> with Drew and Andy. Drew (Greypawn) has described it upthread. A stone king adopted a brutalized boy as son and heir, working patiently to convince him to remove his memories in the form of tiny jewels, and store them in a treasure vault so he could never be hurt again! One great thing about this game--all the symbolism and fictional conjunctions were spot-on, through pure serendipidous improvization on our part. We'd throw out a detail having no idea what it would mean, and later have an "aha!" moment where of COURSE it meant THIS all along, and nothing could be more fitting and right. The great oak in the forest aboveground was the King's original son, turned into a living thing! Of COURSE his roots reached down into the bedroom that had housed our hero! And of COURSE the tiny whithered tree in the treasure vault was the Queen! And so forth. In the end, young Justin--The Just One--coaxed the king to embrace feeling again, reunite with his family and allow his cold stone body to become rich soil from which new life could bloom--and thus the land was healed!<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts </b>in the <i><span style="color: #006600;">Dark Forest</span></i> with Carl, Tori, Ryan and Noah. Us guys were a Witch, an Infernal and a Fay, vying for the attention of Tori's self-involved mortal, Doe. The Witch boy Zane ("I prefer to be called Zarathustra") was stealing locks of Doe's hair for a love spell, and the InfernaI Twitch lured her out to the Forest Ring and offered her to his Power as a new disciple. After Doe clubbed Twitch to death to usurp his place as disciple, I tried to white-knight it and warn her about Zane's intentions...and also got bludgeoned into oblivion for my trouble. Doe WANTED a guy who would use and take from her--I underestimated the degree to which Tori was viciously parodying Bella Swan! Also, I feel it vitally important to tell you that my Fay boy Andrel looked exactly like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeR9_7cACUc" rel="nofollow">Patrick Wolf</a>.<br/><br/><b>Sea Dracula</b> with Mmme and Mssrs Ocelot, Kangaroo, Gerbil and Mulder, as expertly facilitated by the Hon. Judge Jacksno. Simply phenomenal. You don't have to take my word for it; Tori posted video! The proud, ridiculous lawyers of Animal City were each sensational. I was delighted to make an impromptu appearance as a card-carrying Boss monster, ultimately defeated in limb-severing glory by one Calypso Kangaroo, Panda Lawyer. I'm glad I dressed up for the occasion; professional pride demands no less!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328935/#Comment_328935" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T23:19:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 11:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rian_bean</cite>Sea<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dragon!</span>Dracula (I keep calling it that)<br/><br/>I missed the beginning set up, and I had a camera malfunction part way through, so its missing a little bit.<br/>Was filmed on a regular digital camera, so the quality is so-so.<br/><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/seadrag1" rel="nofollow">Part One</a><br/>Part Two<br/>Part Three</blockquote>\nI cannot watch any of these, but (I think) I am glad they exist.

He narrates that the hacker deftly extracts the files and regards them smugly... but then freezes in terror as the ghostly hands of the network's counter-measures emerge from the sphere, reaching through his defenses, one retrieving the stolen data while the others seize his identity and current location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329154/#Comment_329154" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T13:54:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  1:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            woah!

Once I had the address I still rode past it again, and slowly zeroed in on the little sign posted outside the alleyway. I was surprised that it was just a symbol and didn\u2019t proclaim the title of the convention or anything, and looking into the alleyway all I could see was a foreboding big black truck and an equally foreboding and black door covered in graffiti. I skeptically passed on by that doorway to check if there was something better past the truck. There I found a cardboard box with another symbol on it and an arrow pointing to another doorway. Admittedly the black spray painted cardboard box made me worried about the quality of the art I\u2019d be experiencing inside, but once I stepped inside I was very relieved, even somewhat awed.<br/><br/>I had shown up late so I wasn\u2019t sure what to do for a moment. I wandered back and forth, scoping out people playing different games, then walked up to a table and asked if I could join. I got shuffled around a little until I was invited to join Walking in Halcyon, run by Jackson. I was pretty blown away with how simple and open ended the game was. And peaceful. I felt almost childish playing it but that was a huge part of it\u2019s charm too. I also really liked the mechanic where you put five counters in the middle of the play space and people could take one out at anytime. When the last one was taken the scene ended, so it was like a silent yet consensual living sand timer.<br/><br/>The next game I played, Friday evening, was The Quiet Year, which has already been discussed but consists of playing the decision making body of a post apocalyptic settlement trying to build a new society over the course of a year. In retrospect it feels similar to microscope in the way that I felt I was building a history one step at a time, but it\u2019s much more linear and focused and more like leaning over a petri dish civilization and waking it go while trying to poke it in the right direction, and throwing in the occasional catastrophe. Our game was something of a Lord of the Flies Comedy of Errors, which often stepped into the hilariously absurd while still being vaguely plausible.<br/><br/>For the late late Friday slot I played roll for shoes with Alex (playing a strange mutant ball with a telescope  growing out of it, known to some as Satan), Jackson (playing a strange magical man who was sensitive about his hygiene) ,  a \u201cfine fellow\u201d whose name I can\u2019t at this moment I can\u2019t recall (who played a very strong guy who really wanted his axe back and ended up being driven insane),  and Johnstone facilitating. The game consisted of having three stats, adventuring, strength, and magic, assigning 1d6, 1d4, and 1d8 among them, and then rolling the appropriate stat whenever you wanted\u2026 anything. You could roll to claim to have a piece of equipment, or an ability, or to use one, with the facilitator rolling against you. Beating the facilitator means you get whatever you were trying for, rolling a six means you get a new skill related to whatever you were rolling for which gives you an extra D6 when used. Rolling 6 or higher on both dice for the new skill gives you yet another more specific skill with yet another D6 added.<br/><br/>I played a daring and adventurous 1920s era Pilot named \u201cCaptain Jackson\u201d who had a little bit of Indiana Jones in him and used as many cheesy one liners as possible. At the start of the game I rolled to have a pistol and rolled low so I was given an old pistol and chose a Luger. I shot a floating head and acquired a level 1 skill of sharpshooter. Because we were visiting an art exhibit in reverse London I acquired Art History when attempting to have knowledge of the art dealer we heard about, who I decided was part of the illuminati which I had been battling for 8 years. I earned a Lasso Whip skill by pulling out my trusty Lasso whip to grab onto an elevator and somehow swing around it in the shaft to land on top of it. I earned Automaton Programming skill after sharpshooting a robot to reprogram it\u2019s insides with my bullet and later making retroactive rolls to say I had also programmed in countermeasures in case anyone tried to reprogram my reprogramming. Oh, and last of all I got the level 2 skill magic bullets. So yes, that game was awesomely silly and fun. <br/><br/>Saturday I played Microscope in the afternoon slot with Ben and Johnstone, which was the game I already talked about with the Zoophages. Saturday night I played Apocalypse world with Joel facilitating which he already described much more succinctly and elegantly than I possibly could. Apocalypse got a little slow at some points due to party splitting up during very descriptive combat rounds, so it ended up going into the late night session, but it was an awesome game and it was great to play it in the Apocalypse caf\xe9 with the creators of the space. I definitely felt like there was meant to be more sex in that game then there was, which I think led to everyone\u2019s character having ambiguous sexual orientation at the end. This is probably due to the fact that no one could figure out whether the most attractive character, the battle babe, was a guy or a girl, and The Hoarder just being hot for his hoard.<br/><br/>My last game was the art history microscope game already talked about. That is, if I don\u2019t count Sea Dracula, which was incredible, and I thank you all for making me feel comfortable enough to get on stage and dance without any idea what I was doing.<br/><br/>Altogether it was one of the best weekends I\u2019ve had in my life and something I really needed.

Canning</cite>Saturday night I played Apocalypse world with Joel facilitating which he already described much more succinctly and elegantly than I possibly could. Apocalypse got a little slow at some points due to party splitting up during very descriptive combat rounds, so it ended up going into the late night session, but it was an awesome game and it was great to play it in the Apocalypse caf\xe9 with the creators of the space. I definitely felt like there was meant to be more sex in that game then there was, which I think led to everyone\u2019s character having ambiguous sexual orientation at the end. This is probably due to the fact that no one could figure out whether the most attractive character, the battle babe, was a guy or a girl, and The Hoarder just being hot for his hoard.</blockquote>\nI'll take on the responsibility for that dynamic. I really enjoy a sex-and-relationship heavy vibe in my Apocalypse World games, but I'm still pretty shaky on the MC skills to facilitate it. With everything I was juggling, I found it hard to zero in the parts of the situation that would make for messy humanity. The two main incidents of the evening, the desperate gang members and the double-crossing meet with Dragon lady were pretty much "they're enemies, shoot 'em down" kind of problems. I was fond of what I was doing with Dustwich and <b>Molly</b>, but it didn't go much of anywhere <b>after Artimouse stole Dustwich's gun for his Horde.</b> And as mentioned, Jeanette really did want to fuck Damson, but she was pretty much just taking orders from Dragon Lady, who (following that blown manipulate) wanted y'all wiped out. In 20/20 hindsight, I would've thought more about what Jeanette might do or say, contrary to her boss' orders, out of her love (lust) for Damson. Oh well.<br/><br/>So while we had a fun, casual kind of session, I don't feel like I really enabled the full AW experience for you. I could say I was tired (i was) and that my MCing was sort of an impromptu decision (it was), but in the end I'm chalking it up to a learning experience to reflect on.

I hope I wasn't too much of a spotlight hog, I'm usually the GM and I love being on the spot and causing things to happen. I don't usually get to be a player either, and most of my experiences have been with some combat heavy D&amp;D games (I want to play a smartass rogue specced for social! ...who then just backstabs as the paladin grandstands. I want to be a mysterious, classical, beardy wizard as old as the roots of the mountains! ...who has to find a magic trinket and just magic missiles a lot). And Damson was me finally getting to do the crazy stylish shit I want my PCs to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI adored the whole idea of the Night Theater, though. It was just a fantastically Apocalypse World kind of idea.I loved our slightly murderous troupe of film junkies bringing scrounged media from the past, barely recognizable as anything any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have loved to see where stuff would have gone, and I *really* should have tried to seduce Janine in retrospect, that would have been an awesome way out of that jam. But as joel says, hindsight is 20/20.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330116/#Comment_330116" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T18:59:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  6:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Captain Thark</cite>But as joel says, hindsight is 20/20.81 to 103 of 103</blockquote>\nYup! I'm not so much interested in beating ourselves up over "mistakes," as I am in reflecting and refining techniques. And in conveying to y'all the ways this AW experience might not have been representational.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning" title="Orion Canning"><img alt="Orion Canning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/n90YJAPJ48BYJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning">Orion Canning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330156/#Comment_330156" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T01:26:20+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  1:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>So while we had a fun, casual kind of session, I don't feel like I really enabled the full AW experience for you.</blockquote>\nWhatever it was it was still a lot of fun. Honestly I think the game was right at my comfort level at the time, though I am curious what the "full" experience might look like.<br/><br/>Also, the olympia meetup group works, we had a great meeting today with some new people showing up. We had a nice game of Fiasco which involved workers at an antarctic military research lab testing bombs on the local wildlife. Highlights of the game include the biologist Dr Griffith and the americorp worker Moonshadow keeping a closet full of frozen seals as evidence, Moonshadow having an affair in said closet with his boss, the only Female in antartica, then accidentally making copies of the security camera dvd and distributing them to all the coworkers mailboxes, Dr Griffith's secret lover, who was in a full body cast after being trampled by a stampede of penguins, blackmailing The Female with the DVD only to get beat the crap out of by her and be mistaken by her Husband as having an affair with her, The Secret Lover eating the seals in the closet to regain his strength, The Secret Lover being trampled by penguins again, The Diver, who hated The Husband and was best friends with The Secret Lover, beating up The Female for beating up his best friend, after which she chased him down with a tractor and bulldozed the neighborhood, and the husband coming to shoot Moonshadow while he was handcuffed to a table in a room full a penguins as a protest, only to have Dr. Griffith save Moonshadow by stabbing The Husband in the neck with an ice axe after getting accidentally shot.<br/><br/>Fiasco games are hard to summarize...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330230/#Comment_330230" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:15:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:15AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orion Canning</cite>I am curious what the "full" experience might look like.</blockquote>\nyou know that stuff with Dustwich and his new gun and Molly and the angry protectiveness?
