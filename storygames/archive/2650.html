This'll be the third showcase in a row. The two previous ones were workshops with demos, at this year's Fasatval, we'll try something different: we'll play a complete session of various indie games. <br/>\nI'm guessing that there'll be somewhere around 7 to 8 groups and I'd prefer if we'd be able to showcase four or five different games - more, if possible.<br/>\nSo, the question now is: what games to choose?<br/>\nI'm thinking Contenders (it's easy, has a low threshold and is GM-less), MLWM (no prep needed, the theme is very strong) and the like. BUT, I'd really also like us to be able to showcase other games such as TSOY or Perfect or Agon.<br/>\nFor the latter group of games I think it would be better to have at least partly premade characters as well as a situation prepped. Keeping in mind that these sessions should take from three to five hours and should preferably showcase some of the important points of indie design, what would YOU recommend? Also, does ayone here know of great material for convention play of these games (I remember something about Jason's TSOY-game, but I don't think I ever read how it went and what the lessons were).<br/>\nSpecific game recommendations are also most welcome. Hell, any help is welcome!<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nPeter                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60953/#Comment_60953" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T05:55:21+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  5:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can run a substantial Contenders game in four hours and it will be fun.

He talked about going to one of the big Danish cons last year (it may have been Fastaval) and running a slate of indie games. I'm sure he'd be a good man to bounce ideas off for this kind of thing.

Although your mention of partially premade characters does actually work with CC. Leave Trust and Attributes blank and allow the players to assign them. <br/><br/>However, I think that Contenders is an exceptionally strong choice for a start-with-nothing-and-have-a-game session. I'd also suggest Best Friends as being equally strong in that regard, as it promotes communal setting creation and character creation in a very distinct and engaging way.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61031/#Comment_61031" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T11:50:35+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Per is one of my good friends and we enjoyed a hearty game of the Roach last year at Fastaval ;) <br/>\n/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66277/#Comment_66277" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T05:07:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  5:07AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgot to follow up on this!<br/>\nThe two indie/story games workshops at Fastaval were a tremendous success. Among the games played were MLWM, Contenders, 1001 Nights, The Pool, In a Wicked Age, Dogs and others. This is the third time we organize something like this - but the first two times we spent a lot of time on the theory and on discussing the "indie movement". This time we just played the games - GO PLAY - and it was sweet. It seems that most Danish roleplayers don't need to learn the design thoughts and theory, but can just jump right in and play.<br/>\nHighlights:<br/>\nPeople standing up during Contenders, a lot of die-rolling, smiles, laughs, yelling and the occasional scream - and evil grins from the Master. Lots of fun, lots of happy gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66281/#Comment_66281" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T05:52:15+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  5:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great news!

I only took part in the first (two small kids makes it hard to spend a whole lot of time at a con), where we had five groups of five players each - Saturday saw similar attendence numbers. That's 50 players all in al, which is pretty good for Fastaval.<br/>\nThe vibe was very positive and game systems have also begun influencing the con scenarios for real. We saw a lot of smaller ripples in \xc2\xb406, but this year to me it seems as if it's even more evident.<br/>\nI played Contenders with a group of people that I for the most part haven't gamed with before. It was a pleasant surprise that a) I didn't need to introduce conflict resolution, scene framing etc and b) that a lot of people that I've never met, play or have tried indie games/story games. That's a significant change from last year.<br/>\nOne of the best parts, however, was that the ones organizing the two events were attendees at last year's event. Which means that it's steadily spreading!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
