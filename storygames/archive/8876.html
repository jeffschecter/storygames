Kind of like Stephen King's <i>IT</i> or <i>Children of the Corn</i>. I heard a brief mention of it when it was in playtest, and then nothing. <br/><br/>Now I find out that it's been in print for awhile. I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this game. I for one, would like to hear more, how it's played out, and what the games ended up like.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196263/#Comment_196263" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T08:44:37+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  8:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, I didn't want anyone else but me playing it.

It's pretty good. Great setting and a competent system. It uses playing cards. I'm moderately enthusiastic about it - note my slightly restrained tone, because the system is workable rather than <i>massively</i> exciting - but, yes, it's worth having a look at, especially if you like that rural horror theme. Which I do.<br/><br/>One interesting thing is that "rural horror" seems to encompass both rednecks in the American South with shotguns and hicks in the British West Country with pitchforks and, bizarrely, the combination works.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196342/#Comment_196342" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T17:55:59+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  5:55PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>seems to encompass both rednecks in the American South with shotguns</blockquote>\nWell, we are kinda cool and magical...(wink)<br/><br/>We Southerners in America have always known that Rednecks are everywhere.  From Alabama to Hokkaido, there are rednecks to be had - and when the dark settles in the trees and the churchyard yawns, we SEE THINGS you people wouldn't believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196379/#Comment_196379" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T05:10:51+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  5:10AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, thanks to Graham for tipping me off about this thread. I've never been very good at promotional stuff. In case anyone hadn't guessed, I'm Ash, the author of Fearmonger. If you've got any questions please feel free to ask.<br/><br/>It's funny this thread should come up now actually, as I just started working on a kind of sequel / spiritual successor to Fearmonger. It's still  in the preparatory stages, but since it's using the same basic system with a few tweaks, it shouldn't take so long to develop. It's very much its own game though, and the tweaks in the system should emphasise quite a different style of play. I'm quite excited about it so far.<br/><br/>Not that I've gone off Fearmonger though, I'm still very fond of that game. That's one of the reasons I want to expand it in a new direction, and appeal to fans of more modern style horror.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196435/#Comment_196435" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T13:35:02+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  1:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, hey, I've got a question.
