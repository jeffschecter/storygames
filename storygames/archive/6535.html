So here's your opportunity to repay the favor.  I don't understand Fate and/or Spirit of the Century.  I see everyone getting all excited and... I don't get it.  Those of you who have read and have difficulty with Sorcerer... that's how I feel about Fate.  In the end it may turn out that Fate/SotC just isn't for me and my preferences.  That's fine but I want to give all the excitement about the game a fair shake.<br/><br/>So let's start with what appears to be the heart of the system: Aspects.<br/><br/>This is my instinct with what to do with Aspects.  I want Compels to be actually be agonizingly painful for the player.  Not in that distanced, "Oh that's so tough on my character but fun for me to watch" way but actually tough for the player to personally comply with.  Imagine a character whose kind of a pulp detective who has "There's Always a Dame..."  My instinct would then to follow the Dogs in the Vineyard style of considering the choices made in the previous game and escalating them in the next.<br/><br/>So you're a sucker for women eh?  What about this woman?  What about THAT woman?  What about THIS woman with THAT woman in THIS situation?  How about now?  There's always a Dame... eh?  What about THIS DAME?  Putting increasing, amounts of pressure and complexity until the player was begging, "Dear God, please, please don't MAKE me do THAT?!  ANYTHING but THAT!"<br/><br/>In other words, I would consider it my job as the GM to find the breaking point where the player is sincerely struggling to pay off my Compels.<br/><br/>But something tells me that this is not really what Aspects are for.  First of all doing this consistently across six Aspects for three to four players would be rather exhausting.  Second of all that doesn't exactly jive with the rest of the Aspect rules particularly the Situational and Environmental ones.  Thirdly it doesn't really fit with how I've actually seen the game played.<br/><br/>When I've seen the game played Aspects strike me more as a form of Thematic Front Loading.  It's effectively a list of pre-play set of expectations for character behavior.  So if our character has the Aspect, "There's Always A Dame..." when the GM has the Femme Fatale show up everyone at the table starts laughing and nodding because they know EXACTLY what's about to happen.  The player of the character in question knows things are about to get uncomfortable for his character but he, himself has actually been looking forward to this moment along with the rest of the players.<br/><br/>Effectively, it's the GM's job to set up situations that allow the players to pose their characters for the camera, so to speak.  At character creation Aspects say, "This is what my character is about..." and in play the GM sets up situations for the player to simply demonstrate that.<br/><br/>So do I have aspects right?  Am I asking too much of them in my expectations?  Am I selling them short in my actual observations?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144944/#Comment_144944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T13:50:52+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  1:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd give a more exhaustive reply, and perhaps in time I will, but for now I will say:<br/><br/>You got it right, I think. In both ways. See, Fate != Spirit of the Century, and I think that's the crux of your disconnect. SotC is a specific implementation of the Fate system which is typically played fast, loose and over-the-top, with an emphasis on reveling in pulp themes and tropes. Your Femme Fatale example illustrates perfectly what my expectations are for SotC play - predictable, a little corny, but familiar, fun and action-packed. Intense boundary pushing is not what the game is about.<br/><br/>Fate as a general system is a different matter. The mechanics behind Aspects are useful and flexible enough to be used in many different contexts, and I have no doubt that they <i>can</i> be used in a manner such as your instincts prompts you to use them. In my experience, that's not SotC, though. I have not yet peeked at the Dresden Files, perhaps some guidance can be had from that text?<br/><br/>All the above "in my experience", of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144950/#Comment_144950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T14:09:32+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  2:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would guess, given the source material, that the Dresden Files game approaches Aspects at the same angle as SOTC, since they are pulpish themselves.<br/><br/>I like this take on Aspects, though, it's clear to me that it's a flexible system that can be used in many different ways.  Maybe even more than one simultaneously - sure, 3-4 aspects for 4-5 players is too much to hammer like a gong, but 1 each? That's a lot more feasible.  (Not that my players would like it, we like detachment and banter and laughing a lot at the poor dumb saps in our games, due to having jobs all week about Alzheimers and child abuse and so on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144955/#Comment_144955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T14:23:28+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  2:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the implementation of Aspect in Dreden are 'pulpy' although Dresden kinda stabs at being noir in places.  The "Personal Struggle" aspect specifically tries to place your character in a escalating set of binds that beg for some kind of "Dear God, please, please don't MAKE me do THAT?! ANYTHING but THAT!" moments.  I'm not sure in the shorter playtest work done so far this has come to the surface but in a longer game I could see it happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144958/#Comment_144958" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T15:09:00+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  3:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lachek pretty much nailed it.  SOTC is not as brutal as other games of Fate can be.  In SOTC, the threat to the woman you love is that she gets strapped to a death ray or kidnapped by dinosaurs or something, not that she's contracted AIDS from the guy she was cheating on you with or is only in the relationship with you because it satisfies her self-destructive urge.  Trying to hit the points of emotional pain in a high flying game of talking gorillas in biplanes  gets outright jarring.<br/><br/>But that's specific to SOTC.  If you're doing Buffy, the notes that get hit with aspects get more brutal.  If you're doing Amber (at least by our lights) they get more brutal still.  They shape themselves to the nature of the game you're looking to play, and hopefully that's more feature than bug.<br/><br/>Basically, your first impression was correct. That escalation of pain? Aspects live there. Hell, _Fred_ lives there.  But the pulp experience is not (and should not be) the noir experience, so the advice on using aspects for SOTC is simply _not_ the advice for a game that's not pulpy.  However, that does not mean that the way they're used in SOTC (very fast and loose, high octane, low rigor) is the _only_ way they can be used. <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144959/#Comment_144959" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T15:09:12+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  3:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMHO it is problematic to see aspects as a primary character from an abstract fate3 view (which no one knows yet, so I'm safe to make up what I like). Maybe this is part of where the confusion comes from. 'Aspect' is just a piece of leverage; ideally both to your advantage and detriment, depending on what the situation at hand is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheres aspects tied to campaigns, adventures, sessions, scenes, people; you can add to these by assessments, declarations or consequences (which, at the end of the day, are just declarations won by fists).<br/>\nIn this aspect ecosystem, you could do away with permanent character aspects and just use skills and stunts: You'd still have a fate game, just a way more volatile one character-aspect wise. This approach would also open up a venue for character experience: The Aspects are what characters take from their endeavors, which makes them more powerful and vulnerable at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy then does Spirit of the Century (and Dresden) have permanent Aspects?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one, it's easier to see them as a GM to pick from. With a group of four players, it is not your task to ping every single character aspect; just some of them, maybe one or two per character (so we're down from 24 aspects to herd to eight). Thus you can see them as flags showing you want the kind of situation a player expects their character to be in. A player buying out of a compel is not necessarily doing that because he is at a break point; I guess they're probably more inclined to do that because they're not particularily interested in the effects of that aspect right now. The fact that people usually don't starve for Fate Points might support this hypothesis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, they help me as a player understand my character better. I derive the aspects from my character building phases (books, novels, seasons, whatever) to make sure what part of that story floats my boat (again, flagging, but for me as a player as much as for a GM).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least, they are an additional resource I just might need to win conflicts, intrinsic levers I use to turn fate in my characters favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144967/#Comment_144967" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T15:50:31+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  3:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>...in a high flying game of talking gorillas in biplanes....</blockquote>\nThis is something else that confuses me about SotC.

But the short answer is that I have no idea if there are any _specific_ talking gorilla in a biplane stories out there, but there sheer expanse of just plain weird shit in the pulps makes Gorilla Khan look like a total piker.<br><br>And even if the pulps begin and end at the cast of Defender of the Earth for the average reader, its worth noting that while there are a few pedantic bounds on what pulp is or is not, they have been consistently broken by modern passion, and modern reimaginings of the pulps (sometimes called neopulp or pulp2) are as much a part of the scenery as the classics  - for examples check out the Tales of the Shadowmen collections, The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril, some of Ellis's Planetary stuff and so on.  All of which is to say, it is not a purist game by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>Though all that said, man, if you don't want to like it, go ahead and toss it aside.
