It's a really big change from the fortune (dice and cards) based conflict resolution games I usually play.  <br/><br/>One of the things I noticed most is that the Drama resolution encouraged a lot of focus on fine details of the setting and the scene.  It mattered what people were wearing and where they were standing, the exact words they used in a speech, and so on.  I realised that this was something I'd been missing from a lot of my other games.<br/><br/>It seems to me that conflict resolution can sometimes discourage focusing on details of a scene, talking out <i>how</i> things happen, in favour of just figuring out <i>what</i> happens.  I'm talking specifically about games like The Mountain Witch and TSoY, which have a single roll for conflict resolution, and then encourage you to narrate what happened after the event.  By the time the roll has been made, the details no longer matter.  It's up to the player to describe what happens (in The Mountain Witch), and a lot of the time their focus in on setting up the situation to get what they want, not on fleshing out details of the opposition's actions or the world.  TSoY (barring BDtP) can also end up steamrollering opposition, at the expense of finding out exactly what happened.<br/><br/>Now, a lot of the time I think this is a good thing.  Often, I don't care how something happened, I just want to get to the next exciting part. But sometimes I think some evocative details are missed.  Is this just me?  How about other games?  Do they do the same thing?  Does anyone else notice the same phenomenon?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135448/#Comment_135448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T17:45:29+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  5:45PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, <br/><br/>Recently I've been calling what you're talking about meta-resolution or scene-resolution (depending), to differentiate them from conflict resolution games like Wicked or Sorcerer in which the details are just as important. <br/><br/>Because, yes, I do find that sometimes in games with 10,000 foot view resolution, I tend to slip towards statements of intent and generalities, rather than specifics and actions. Like "I try to disarm him" rather than "I hurl myself at him and start yanking his gun arm down so that I can break his wrist" or whatever. I think part of it is just me being sloppy, but I do think that there are ways in which having a system that is designed to deal with what rather than how and the whole rather than the specific you'll tend to shift your focus towards that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135451/#Comment_135451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T17:53:37+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  5:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, <br/><br/>Also, did you see Ron's post about Sorcerer, vis a vis some things related to this? <br/><br/>Like, um... <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25892.msg249451#msg249451" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>.

I think The Pool is an interesting example of this, where there's a huge scope for the scale of conflicts.  I've found that my habit is to move to larger scale conflicts - to gloss over the details.  That Sorcerer thread is spot on in nailing the distinction, where Ron talks about declaring intent in Sorcerer being about actual bodies in motion, just before they move.  "Intent" isn't just what you hope to achieve from the conflict, it's what the character is actually doing to get that.  <br/><br/>Do you think maybe there's some tension between resolving intent (i.e. do you get what you want) and resolving action (i.e. how you go about getting it?).  It seems like a sticking point in Sorcerer (it was really hard for me), and maybe in some other games as well.<br/><br/>What I can attest to is that refocusing on details of actions seemed to have a synergystic effect on focusing on details of the setting.  I found myself spending more time in detailing the clothing of NPCs, the layout of a room, and so on, knowing that it might be important later.  That's all stuff that is perfectly possible in almost any game, but I found myself encouraged to do it more in this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135466/#Comment_135466" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T19:56:06+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  7:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, <br/><br/>Absolutely. Any game in which the fine details make a substantiative and formative difference is going to result in more attention being paid to those details. Any game in which the details don't matter, systemically, is going to pay less attention. I mean, players in the game could pay attention, but its an matter of individual initiative rather than something the rules help you with. <br/><br/>Another thing that this reminds me of is a game of Dogs I played, in which we got tired of folks randomly improvising dice from items in. It was getting to the ridiculous point of people just running in endless d6s on every go, and so we started doing a "fits the fiction" rule, where something had to be logical, pre-mentioned, and agreed by everyone in the group. Once we started getting really serious about the rule, the whole nature of narration of space, detail, and appearance changed. Which also lead to some really interesting things where whole conflicts were done over how well someone kept up his barn and what that meant about his moral character. <br/><br/>OTOH, in some of the games that I run with graphic novel-esque pacing and structure, the detail is deliberately left a little vague. If I'm doing a swords and sorcery game, for example, we'll often hyper focus on a couple of specific issues, places, and details, but leave the background a rather bright blur with blacks for night and reds for blood and sand. For that kind of thing something like Trollbabe works quite well, as it has a system that zooms in tight on certain aspects of the game, and in fact ties the resolution system directly to the ongoing use of details in the world, but other than the items zoomed into frame, everything else can stay happily in the gutter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135488/#Comment_135488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T23:06:53+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 11:06PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was actually about to mention both Dogs and IAWA as games that emphasize narrating each step of a conflict, versus PTA, which only has an optional rule for breaking down narrating a conflict, and then Dust Devils which just hands narration and a conflict result to someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135550/#Comment_135550" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T10:57:46+00:00" title="March 19, 2008 10:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2008 12:09PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>It seems to me that conflict resolution can sometimes discourage focusing on details of a scene, talking out<i>how</i>things happen, in favour of just figuring out<i>what</i>happens.</blockquote>\nAlmost every time this has happened with us, it's because we were engaging resolution before we were really playing the scene. Like this:<br/><br/><b>John</b>: "Oh, next I want my guy to go steal a cold iron cross from the Church to use against the faerie in the well."<br/>(the GM <i>starts</i> to set up a scene, but it bleeds over into meta-play discussion)<br/><b>GM</b>: "Okay... how about we do a scene where you have tracked some Inquisitors to a house they're going to raid. They'll be using some cold iron crosses there to ward off glamours and black magic."<br/><b>John</b>: "Yeah, so I sneak in the servant's entrance and wait for them to place the crosses around the perimeter, then I snatch one and escape on the rooftops."<br/><b>GM</b>: "Yeah, but they might catch you in the act. Let's roll dice!"<br/><b>John</b>: "5! Sweet. I totally steal one and get away!"<br/><br/>No details, no concrete actions, because the scene was never actually framed and started. It was just <i>discussed</i>. We never got into the moment and specific circumstance to play the scene.<br/><br/>Contrast that with:<br/><br/><b>John</b>: "Oh, next I want my guy to go steal a cold iron cross from the Church to use against the faerie in the well."<br/><b>GM</b>: "It's near midnight on the street of the candle makers. You're across the street from Jacob Harrison's house, hiding behind a hay cart. You know the Inquisition has targeted this house for a raid. Through a window on the ground floor, you can see that some Church agents are already inside, setting up defenses against the dark arts, including those nifty cold iron crosses of theirs. What do you do?"<br/><b>John</b>: "I scan up and down the street to see if anyone is on guard outside..."<br/><br/>And so on. If you frame in first, then play the scene, taking actions in the fiction instead of just discussing stuff player-to-player, then the details come to life. And in doing that, you build context and action which informs how a conflict of interest might develop (or not) and <i>then</i> you go to your resolution system. Not before. Even if you frame much more aggressively (starting the scene in the moment when my guy reaches to snatch a cross from an inquisitor's belt) the same principle applies. Frame the scene. Start play within the moment-to-moment of the fiction (at whatever scale of moments make sense), then see what conflicts of interest fall out of the concrete fictional actions.

Would this qualify as drama resolution for you:<br/><br/>In Bliss stage, you have scenes where the mechanical outcome of the scene doesn't have anything to do with dice rolls, but is instead determined by what happens in the scene. After the scene is over, you determine the outcome based on things like did your characters build trust, or was trust broken? Did they build intimacy? Did they re-affirm the nature of their relationship? This leads to a very different kind of play. In my limited experience, I think I've seen a lot of potential for a return to the details of the scene in that kind of play. There's no mechanical way in Bliss Stage to pre-load the scene with a mechanical outcome, and attempts to do so inevitably backfire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135608/#Comment_135608" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T21:21:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  9:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip,<br/><br/>I think a lot of the effect was synergystic - I'd add detail at the start of the scene, in case it became important later (resolution's not quite the right word though, because in the game there's never a switch between "just playing" and "resolving conflicts", so it doesn't feel much like conflict resolution at all).  Even when it wasn't important for resolution, it added to the scene.  There were a few times that it was directly important to the resolution though.  For example, right at the start of the game, there was a scene where the player's character was fleeing from some army scouts.  The player described leaping on his horse, and riding away over the sand.  I described two horsemen breaking off to pursue.  The character tried to shoot one of them with his bow, but I told him that a shot behind him while riding his horse full speed was pretty much impossible.  He spent a "wind" coin to make that possible, and the arrow was guided by a gust of desert wind to find its target.  The details of the scene weren't just cosmetic, they were the difference between the player spending a coin or not doing so - a big difference in the game (importantly, spending coins isn't good or bad, it just creates character change and choices).<br/><br/>But I don't think this is something that's specific to Drama resolution.  As John and Brand have demonstrated, there are ways of doing the same thing in conflict resolution too, I think it's just something that the players need to be aware of.<br/><br/>Tony, this thread's not really about my game (much as I'd love to talk about it), but yes, that kinda sounds like Drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135613/#Comment_135613" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T04:07:21+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  4:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly what you are talking about is the default case with most task resolution. In other words you don't know what task resolution rolls you need until you delve into the detail of the scene.<br/><br/>For example in a recent GURPS game a character was trying to cross a crevasse in a mine. What skill should they roll? Jumping? When we delved into the detail we decided there was a statue on the other side, so suddenly it became a case of improvising a grappling hook and throwing it across (using throwing) and then making up a rope bridge from that (survival or climbing or knotwork or whatever) and then pulling themselves over. The details of the attempt were closely examined and decided exactly what sort of approach was going to work.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that doesn't happen in conflict resolution as well, of course it does, just not all the time                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135617/#Comment_135617" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T05:20:48+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  5:20AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, David, absolutely.

I've played with some people who do though, usually with a very strong Gamist agenda, where play is about beating the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

protagonists in a scene<br/>\n- players jump to the conflict quickly (often before establishing enough momentum)<br/>\n- everyone describes their stakes<br/>\n- since it is everyone against the producer, stakes must be parallel and not contradict each other, which can be confusing to do with too many players<br/>\n- resolve who wins<br/>\n- 2-3 players wins<br/>\n- but one of the players who lost wins narration<br/>\n- since the stakes are parallel, they are harder to remember<br/>\n- narrating player asks everyone what their stakes are again<br/>\n- narrating player tries to work in everyone's stakes in to show how the conflict resolved<br/>\n- usually by this point everyone wants to move on rather than explore or sell the aftermath which I suspect has partially to do with the stakes themselves having no tangible mechanical results (which isn't completely true as you can be awarded fan mail for describing the results in an exciting manner that hits on protagonists' issues although it gets a bit wonky when the narrator isn't the protagonist in question).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue often intensifies the larger the stakes are in scope.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I just wanted to add that we usually overcome the above by using the multi flip option in PTA, have multiple conflicts per scene (or when we rotate to the next player, let them frame their next scene as an extension of the previous scene), make sure the narrating player directs the results more than plays out the scene, try not to let the scope of scenes get too insane (measured by the groups interests), limit the number of players per conflict, make sure that if any stakes are actually perpendicular that the player supports the producer rather than have their own stakes, and try to award fanmail that hits issues rather than just purely funny moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135629">\n<div

The question of how much detail matters to those participating in a game has to do precisely with the extent to which it is important in terms of making the next decision interesting, or informing us how that decision will play out. The consequences. <br>\n<br>\nNow, with different agendas, of course, different details are going to matter more. But work on  focusing on the sorts of details that matter to your agenda, and try to refrain from going into those that don't matter. For a particular agenda, those details that don't give the players actionable information are simply color. Some color is great. Too much color means longer waits for the next interesting decision, however. <br>\n<br>\nThis is why, to me, scenario design that assumes certain resolution rolls is bad design. It doesn't matter what the agenda is... if you force a player to make X roll in Y circumstance, there's no decision being made by the player. They're not being allowed to participate creatively. Not even in the simmy, "what would happen if we tried this?" way. <br>\n<br>\nScenarios should set up situations that do not expect any particular response. No matter what the agenda. Systems should be flexible enough to be able to effect resolution on the spot without preparation. <br>\n<br>\nIf you allow players creativity in these things, they'll be creative, and add the sorts of details that you want to see. On the contrary, if you say, "OK, I need a roll for each of you to leap the chasm" you'll just get that die roll. You can, of course, mechanically require detail narration, but that's probably just making unenjoyable work for the players.

Its easier to come up with something within a certain set of bounds, difficulties and limitations, because thinking your way around them requires far more imaginative effort than if you can just think up anything, where you usually take the easiest course (which is often a weak course as well). Its for this reason that I like investigative or mystery solving games, and I think it is the fun a lot of people get from dungeons and traps as well, because problem solving is an imaginative stimulus.<br><br>Nothing stops you doing that with a scene resolution system either, but if your workflow is 'decide an outcome' -&gt; 'roll to see if you get the outcome' -&gt; 'narrate the outcome' the restrictions are very low. You often decide your outcome in a vague sort of notional space, not knowing what has happened yet, which can feel vague, and then narrate it already knowing it worked, which also removes restrictions from you, especially if you get the full Author authority while you do it (so others can't interrupt and say, hey no, that's impossible!)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135639/#Comment_135639" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T07:10:26+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  7:10AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>You can, of course, mechanically require detail narration, but that's probably just making unenjoyable work for the players.

So they combat the gamism by trying to force players to play in ways that the game doesn't promote otherwise. I could mention some titles, but I'd rather avoid the discussion of any particular game here. <br>\n<br>\nDavid, brilliant observation. People have been drifting towards "Come up with the outcome up front" as a methodology for a while, and I've been railing against it. Basically it's the Czege Principle at work. It works better to distribute the roles of:<br>\n - Deciding what's being attempted. <br>\n - Interpreting player itent from that. <br>\n - Creating an interesting outcome that matches the intent, but is surprising in it's creativity. <br>\n<br/>\nI think that most Conflict Resolution systems are weak in this regard, and rely on good play.

As soon as this is understood, the first question to answer is: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Is play interesting, if the character does not get the cross? <br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely, the answer is no. In this case entering a long sequence of task resolution and simulation can be pretty boring, just a long detour from the main focus. Next question to answer is: <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Is it interesting to determine what price, the character is willing to pay to get the cross? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the answer to this is yes, then there is material for conflict resolution. The scene should be framed with enough exposition of detail to make at least two interesting outcomes, both with a price. E.g. will you break the ritual of the inquisition by stealing the cross during ceremony, or will you wait until after the ceremony and be discovered as you run away with the cross? If the answer to the second question is no, then there is no basis for dice rolling and the scene is purely colour. If everybody at the table is already well into the details of the inquisition, the character and the cross, then a simple statement like: "You steal an iron cross from the inquisition during the night" is sufficient. Only if e.g. the inquisition and the cross is new elements into the game do we need to go into a more detailed sequence. A good approach is to let one player narrate the scene (purely author stance).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn PTA I've experienced that a proposed conflict in a scene disappears because everybody at the table just loves the outcome where the character fails, including the player of the character in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nA comment on Johns (jenskots) PTA multiway conflict: Don't do multiway conflicts. Frame your scenes stronger and focus on the central conflict, having other participants help on one side. Multiway conflicts tend to slide into task resolution anyway, with changed intentions during the scene. Dogs is another game that really is better without multiway conflicts. As a GM I try hard to frame scenes that is one dog versus one opposition, perhaps with a supporting dog or group on one side. Otherwise you very quickly degenerate the story into one scene where the dogs have gathered all the town people into the community hall for a big discussion (and likely judgement and execution). Which is confusing and boring.

What I'm saying, and what I think some other people are talking about, is that it's not always the kind of play we want, but habits formed from that sort play mean it's often what we get anyway.  In other words, sometimes it's fun to play the cross-getting scene out in full, not because it helps resolve the character's conflict or because it reveals theme or whatever, but just because it's exposition of the setting, the mood of the game, and who the character is at the time, without change.<br/><br/>It's like the scene at the beginning of a James Bond film, where he breaks into some facility, uses some fancy gadgets, and gets away with the girl, or whatever.  It does nothing to develop the theme of the film, it's just exposition about what's possible in the movie-world, who James Bond is and what he does (more the latter than the former), and what we can expect more of later.<br/><br/>Or it's like a chase scene in a movie.  It's a huge amount of time devoted to "do they get away, or do they not?".  It could be resolved in seconds, but it's not, because what's important is how cool the characters look doing it.<br/><br/>In rpg terms, sometimes it's fun just to explore the world with your character, to enjoy the setting for itself.  What I found using Drama resolution (and what task resolution does often, and what you can do with conflict resolution if you try for it), is that I got a lot of enjoyment from this kind of play, and I realised I'd been missing it from conflict resolution play that was bang! bang! bang! like you describe. <br/><br/>I think absolutely there are times when it's right to cut straight to what's interesting.  I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes what's interesting isn't whether the character succeeds or fails, or what they give up to achieve that, it's just what it looks like when they do it, how it feels to the player, what it says about the setting, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136246/#Comment_136246" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T05:59:49+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  5:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Odd, as I was thinking about this on my way to work this morning. <br/><br/>The thing with Conflict Resolution is (as is the case with several bits of nebulously defined game jargon), different people use it to define different things. For example, the kind of Conflict Resolution going on in Sorcerer is really nothing at all like the kind of Conflict Resolution going on in The Shadow of Yesterday or Story Engine. And then you have systems like Risus or The Pool that <i>can</i> be used to resolve only broad action or scenes, but there's absolutely nothing in their rules which make them ill-suited for resolving blow by blow action, either. <br/><br/>Conflict Resolution, in my estimation, is one of the most useless terms in game design today. Nobody really knows what it means and people hold up several different, wholly dissimilar games, as examples of what Conflict Resolution is. I think people need to quit postering with regard to Conflict Resolution and start using terms that mean something to define what games do -- Narrrow Action Resolution and Broad Action Resolution are terms that make a <i>lot</i> more sense with regard to relaying useful information about a system. <br/><br/>When somebody says, "My game employs Narrow Action Resolution" I immediately get some sense of the scope involved with regard to action resolution in their games. When somebody says, "My game employs Conflict Resolution!" that could mean any one of a dozen things, depending upon who you talk to. So, screw that. Let's talk about action resolution using real words instead of poorly defined, ultimately, meaningless buzz words that mean a hundred different things to as many different people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136250/#Comment_136250" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T06:26:21+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  6:26AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I couldn't disagree more.  I think that the conflict resolution/task resolution distinction is a very useful one.  There's a qualatative difference between system which resolves tasks, and systems which resolve intent, and that's a useful thing to know about a system.  However, you're right that it's <i>also</i> useful to know about the scope of the conflicts being resolved.  I agree with your assessment about the differences between Sorceror, TSoY and so on.  Whether that's a more important difference than conflict/task is kind of personal taste, I guess.  Is it useful to decide which is more important?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

I returned to it briefly this past weekend. It does do some things VERY well, and with an eye out for story focus, this can be very rewarding play (as it was for me this time). My personal preferences when playing story centric games is not 100% conflict scenes anyway, more like 50% conflict and 50% exposition/theme/colour. I think I will explore the middle ground more the coming months. There is definately pitfalls in both play styles that can be fixed by a number of techniques borrowed from the other play style.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to return to your original post: Yes, I also sometimes experience that conflict oriented story games end up skipping a lot of fine details/colour/mood/atmosphere that I experience with other styles of play. Especially when the characters are not yet firmly established in the mind of the player. I have seen this with PTA and with IaWA. Dogs somehow manage to get around it so far. I think this can come from pushing for a strong conflict defined up front in every scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136256/#Comment_136256" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T07:04:03+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  7:04AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.

While I've seen games that have that sort of set up discuss ending scenes without using a resolution mechanic ( exposition type scenes), it seems rare in practice.<br/><br/>jdrakeh: It would likely also help if not just scale was considered, but whether the resolution was between players at the table, or between fictional elements. I've seen a couple of games that don't seem to know where they fall on that question. If CR was to be nailed down as only relating to direct fictional elements at loggerheads, I'd personally be happy, since I could then talk about Player2player stuff more easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136258/#Comment_136258" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T07:18:08+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  7:18AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was running Solipsist on the weekend and I saw that very thing where people skip the details when they know in advance what they are doing. I would ask "How do you want to change reality", the player would tell me, then we'd see if they succeeded, and then it was done, without further narration. I had to poke them and say "and *how* does that happen?" to get more detail.<br/><br/>*but* when they were less sure that they would get what they wanted, and were having to think their way towards a solution, they tended to think a lot more about the details, which comes back to that thing about restrictions spurring their imagination. The more we broke down scenes into smaller chunks (i.e. getting closer to task resolution than scene resolution) the more imaginative they became in their changes, and the more detail they put into their narration.<br/><br/>So as an example, when they were making a change to resolve "how do you deal with a bunch of circus freaks chasing someone" the narration was general, sort of "oh some of my soldiers appear and have a fight with them". But when it was a matter of "how do you stop that missile from hitting you, while the lions are attacking" the answers were very detailed, and I think that is because the unit of action was much smaller and more detailed to start with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136298/#Comment_136298" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T11:41:35+00:00" title="March 25, 2008 11:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Great thread. </b><br/><br/>I had this conversation just a week or two ago with Eric Boyd: I'm noticing how easy (tempting? mandated?) it is in many nu-skool games to skip over exposition and description and jump straight into resolving the scene. This is fucking things up in my own head, because I've always been very sensitive to how exposition influences the formulation of the conflict. Without establishing context -- fuzzy stuff like mood, or substantial stuff like background events leading up to a conflict, or specific stuff like tactical details that are present prior to even thinking there's going to be a conflict -- it's left to the players to fill in that gap. Then we have problems with the SIS, again, because the participants are only on the same page insofar as the conflict, not the exposition, goes.<br/><br/>I don't think I would have even been aware of this shift in my play style until one of my nu-skool game haters pointed out that my scenes now seemed rushed. He didn't like that we were jumping straight into resolution. I hadn't realized it 'til he said it, and then it was very apparent: racing to the resolution <i>now now NOW</i> is not good for the story, whatever the "story" might be.<br/><br/>My solution isn't systematic, just a greater awareness of this phenomenon. I'm focusing more now on using exposition as a pacing mechanism, both in a strong-GM role (BW) and in a stinky hippie role (PTA, InSpectres). This can also ratchet up the intensity of the resolution, which is almost universally A Good Thing. If the players are hopping up and down for resolution, I know then that I haven't rushed the scene.<br/><br/>I've noted this phenomenon most strongly while playing <i>Burning Wheel</i>, mostly because it's my go-to system, but I've had that rush-to-resolve effect crop up in SotC as well. Because BW requires you identify intent as the first step in resolution, that's where everyone's brain goes first. So now I'm jiggering that timing a tiny bit by making sure the players consider context before moving to intent. In SotC, we run into this because the mechanics reward you for tying your Aspects into the action. This helps, some, because it's generating context on-the-fly.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
