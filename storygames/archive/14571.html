Honestly, I wish I enjoyed running the kind of games they sell at this store (lots of Pathfinder, D&amp;D; 4th ed, World of Darness, aka normal RPG big sellers), but these days I find those games to be too "mathy" for my tastes. I had decided to buy a prop for this game. See, Arnold (my co-host on Canon Puncture) goes all out at cons, dressing in character for the game he's running. I decided to buy a pair of steampunk goggles, a nod to the game setting that didn't cost an arm and a leg.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mini-con was well organized and the place was overstuffed with people eating pizza and buying and playing games. It was actually a bit too crowded for any intimate gaming, so I went with Lady Blackbird: the Loud and Obvious version, which the four players seemed to dig.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player who chose Snargle told me he had never played an RPG before, only Magic the Gathering. Other than a minor stumbling block during a refreshment scene when he had to make up character history on the fly and he froze up for a bit, he played rather well. He hit his Key of Banter (get XP for making the players laugh) over and over, so much so that one of the other players wanted to buy it for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Vance and Lady Blackbird were played by a real-life married couple, and it was very funny to watch them bicker in character with these hints of attraction. It was very Han-Leia. The Lady Blackbird used her NPCed bodyguard Naomi Bishop as an ever-present threat to get what she wanted and she whipped out her Stormblood powers often and to good effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last PC was Kale Arkam, chosen by a guy who was actually an engineer. He played the gadget part of Arkam to the hilt, made some nifty doodads to further their escape from the Hand of Sorrow, including a remote detonator for the fuel line of the Hand of Sorrow and a gadget to pop open the hangar bay doors when they were ready to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played for two hours and they got out of the Hand of Sorrow in the final scene. At the end, the married couple told me they were the best "DM" they'd ever played with and the newbie said he had a really good time, as did the engineer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour players, all said they had fun. I had to yell alot to be heard, but otherwise, I had a blast. Three of the players wrote down the URL of Lady B to go download it for themselves and asked to keep their character sheets.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331788/#Comment_331788" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T23:02:45+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run Lady Blackbird several times for completely different groups recently. I'm noticing one common action that groups take:<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how the crew gets out of the brig, when they beat up/kill the guards, they decide to have everyone but Lady Blackbird pose as a guard to lead them to the ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm guessing they're caused by me, things I'm setting up when I run the games.<br/>\nMy set-up has been that the brig has four large common cells and all five characters are in the same cell. The cells are behind a big cog-shaped door and on the other side of the door are four guards playing poker. In the guard room are all of the crew's belongings (except what Arkam has on his person, of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince different groups approach the solution of getting through the ship the same way, am I presenting a railroad here? It isn't my intention. I'm curious about your thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331870/#Comment_331870" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:29:53+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's just a cultural expectation.

I was all like "squee" and stuff.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nVictor, I don't think I could help BUT run LB at GenCon. I mean, I went and bought me a pair of steampunky goggles and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it was cool to watch this newbie process the act of playing an RPG. Funny thing, in the first action sequence, when the crew busts out of their holding cell and get the drop on the guards, I described NPC Naomi Bishop standing in the doorway cracking her knuckles as the cell door opens and I looked at the group and said, "So here's the deal. The question here isn't, 'Do you heroes beat up these prison guards?' Because see, you've got the drop on them, they're toast. The question, right now," I looked straight at the new guy playing Snargle, and then I decide to point right at him, "The question is, 'Are you gonna let Naomi Bishop kill all four of these guards right here and now or are you going to try and stop her?'"<br/>\n<br/>\nHe blinks a couple times, looks at his sheet and says, "Fuck tha police, man. I'm buying off my Key of Conscience and I'm helping her take them out, man!" I was taken aback for a second, nobody's ever done that, like ever. The guy playing Vance starts yelling, "Don't get any blood on their clothes, we need them!" and I see how this is going to go down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then I decide to see how far he'd take things and I start saying, "In those few seconds, you learn a few things Snargle, standing with Naomi and fighting these guys. Like first, if you shove your thumb through a man's eye into his brain at the right angle, hardly any blood squirts out of him. And then you find out, to your surprise, that breaking a man's neck is pretty much bloodless unless its a compound fracture. The only problem is making sure you strip them down before they..."<br/>\n<br/>\n"OK, man, okay. I get it, that's enough," new guy waves his hands at me, looking a bit pale. The rest of them eased back, too, and that's how I told them without saying it directly, "If you want mow down mooks like some fucking video game, I'll take you there, but you'll pay for it. These are squishy people and I have a vivid imagination." I mean, yeah, it could have gone pear-shaped. I was lucky it didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vjwyatt" title="vjwyatt"><img alt="vjwyatt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii93/burner2501/faceyourmanga032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vjwyatt">vjwyatt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332417/#Comment_332417" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T04:23:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  4:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's cool to see how you told them you weren't pulling punches if they decided to go there.
