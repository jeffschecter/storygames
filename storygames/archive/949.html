                    Some time ago, I discussed views and how they fit into PCon3, you can read that discussion <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=696&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The short summary is that views are the parts of what is going on during play to which you pay attention. The claim I made about views is that your enjoyment of play is determined by the complexity of those parts, if they are not too random, or too structured the view will be satisfied, and you will enjoy the play.<br/><br/>Where play controls come in is that you are not passively observing play, you are participating in it. And the ultimate goal of that participation is to satisfy your view. Play controls are how you go from seeing what happens during play, to influencing play and changing your own views to accommodate. In essence, your play control is a model of what is happening in your view right now, and that model tell you what to do to keep that view satisfied.<br/><br/>By no means are play controls static, indeed they are constantly being affected by a variety of different pressures:<br/><br/>1) Pressure to satisfy: your play control is attempting to satisfy its view, and so good decisions are more likely and bad decisions will be avoided in the future. This is the basic having fun or not pressure.<br/><br/>2) Pressure to complexify: your play control is seeking more complex patterns in the satisfaction of your view, increasing its own complexity. This is the experimenting pressure.<br/><br/>3) Pressure to simplify: your play control is seeking to simplify its structure, to reduce the difficulty of making decisions. This the focusing pressure.<br/><br/>All of these pressures are needed to keep your play control functional.<br/><br/><i>Technical Aside - Recursive Models</i><br/>These pressures are really a simplification themselves. What's really going on is that your play control is the model of what comes though the view, and it feedbacks to the events being viewed and even to the changes in the view itself. But this model is also being viewed and controlled, and the model that controls it is likewise. So instead of trying to model the whole thing we approximate in terms of these three pressures. Satisfaction is the needs of the view, while simplicity and complexity are both pressures from the higher levels, which from that level is simply the satisfaction pressure.<br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>So where does immersion come into all of this?<br/><br/>I've concluded that immersion isn't a state, rather it is a means to achieving a wide variety of states, which share common traits. Indeed immersion an excellent example of a class of play controls.<br/><br/>In particular immersion is the narrowing or focusing of views.<br/><br/>Usually this means cutting out the parts of your view that are not satisfied, and focusing on the rest. This process leads to a wide variety of states, many of which are commonly identified as different immersions. Trance states, loss of self into the character, intense concentration, losing track of time, etc.<br/><br/>But the key concern is that this play control only works if the overall dynamics of play will let your view remain satisfied without the pieces you cut out. Sometimes this doesn't work. If you excise the dice mechanic that is needed to actually keep the satisfying patterns about your character, then you'll need to switch out of immersion when that comes to head, or you'll be unsatisfied. This is true even if the mechanic's sole use is to keep other players interacting with your character to the level you wish. Making immersion work seems to be a subtle question of identifying more focused views, and making them work with the play dynamics.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                </div>

                            I was actually getting a different picture of where you were going from the first paragraph.  I was thinking of it in terms of watching TV, you can adjust volume, picture and so on.<br/>
<br/>
What if every player at a table had a set of chips of different colors they could spend on different aspects of "coloring" the game, separate from narrative rights. <br/>
<br/>
You could flip in a chip during someone's kung fu fight and say "More detail on that attack", or there might be another chip that meant "internal emotional narration please" or "give me a flashback".  Sort of an instant challenge system to the player providing narration.                        </div>

                            I am pretty sure that any "meta" mechanism to increase immersion <i>consciously</i> would erode immersion. It's like when you think too hard about something you're really good at, and the thinking about it makes you not able to remember how to do it. Like you try to remember your best friend's number and can't write it down, but your fingers know how to dial it anyway.                        </div>

                            Depends on what kind of mechanisms you create, and what kind of immersion you're trying to facilitate.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's entirely reasonable to create mechanics that don't get in the way of immersion, and possible to create mechanics that enhance it.                        </div>

                            I bet, though, that a simple mechanism like flipping a token could be learned easily enough not to get in the way of immersion.  I have often thought that would be a great thing--I try to pick up on when players are really into a scene or just playing through it, and that would be great.  They would cue me that they want more or less, to get to the things that do draw them in...                        </div>

                            Mendel, sorry if I'm derailing your thread. Here's something on-topic.<br/><br/>I think what you're describing as immersion is what I called "shallow immersion" in last night's discussion, a log of which I will post somewhere once I've gotten permission from its participants. I think your model ignores "deep immersion."<br/><br/>Shallow immersion is when you've built a mental model of the character you're playing and you are testing ideas against it and pruning those that the model rejects. For example, you might consciously or subconsciously test an idea that your character is in love with another character and see what comes back. The idea might fit or not, and you might even feel some emotion about the decision.<br/><br/>Deep immersion is when you've built a mental model of the character you're playing and you can "enter" it and temporarily replace your own mental model with the character's. That is, you don't have to test ideas against a different mental model; all ideas are processed against your own mental model, which is temporarily overlaid with the character's.  Obviously, we don't <i>become</i> our characters. The character doesn't exist except as a mental construct. But we've retrained our mind to think a different way. This is, I think, very similar to the way cognitive-behavioral therapy and method acting work.<br/><br/>Does your model dispute that deep immersion exists or does it account for it in some way?                        </div>

I think I missed this part of the discussion, but yes, very much so. When you're using mechanism that support character doing something, you don't have to step far from thinking what the character does; you can justify the action and do the mechanics stuff and perhaps identify your dice roll (or whatever) as the actual action ("I'm jumping from the cliff... Oh, hell.")<br/><br/>Techniques that employ player-self force you to step out of the character and think as a player. When you step back into the character it might be hard to justify the action. It's like an outside force (puppeteer, if you will) has guided you to do something.<br/><br/>Obviously, the separation is not that clear cut when you're actually playing.                        </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>As you put it, deep immersion is immersing into the view of the character, while shallow immersion is immersing into the combine view of the character and your relationship to it. The views and, hence, the immersion process are quite different, and will be better supported by different dynamics of play. But they still follow the same act of focusing views. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>

                            There are three major ideas I'm attempting to relate:<br/><br/>1) Players have views, which describe the portions of play to which they attend. Views are satisfied if those portions of play are neither too random or too simple. (I went into this in great depth in the post I linked above.) The following is a very incomplete list of views, and any of these could be combined into a view as well:<br/><br/>My character<br/><br/>The differences between my character and my self<br/><br/>The apparent emotional states of the other players<br/><br/>My own emotional state<br/><br/>The procedure of mechanical combat<br/><br/>The description of combat<br/><br/>My character's "dots"<br/><br/>Whether another player is romantically interested in me<br/><br/>The fictional world<br/><br/>The plot of the story<br/><br/>2) The proactive part of views is how we decide to influence play based on those views. We arrive at these decisions through play controls. Play controls are always changing, under the pressures of simplicty, complexity, and satisfaction. Since they are internal and impermanent, we cannot observe them directly, but we can observe the effects of the pressures on how we interact with play. The following are some distinctive ways those pressures surface.<br/><br/><i>simplicity</i><br/><br/>Habits, e.g. always going to the same person for narration.<br/><br/><i>complexity</i><br/><br/>Experimentation, e.g. adding new seeds for yourself and others to build on later.<br/><br/><i>satisfaction</i><br/><br/>Avoidance, e.g. after a boring encounter with a mechanic or setting element avoiding that element.<br/><br/>3) Immersion as a process implies that it is a type of play control. In particular I've suggested that it is the narrowing or focusing of views. This is both a removal of unsatisfying parts of a larger view, but also a heightening of the elements within the view. In a sense it ups the ante of play, you improve your play at the risk of missing something essential to keep that enjoyment going. This seems to describe different approaches to immersion very well.<br/><br/>I'm saying that immersion means you are intentionally narrowing your attention to specific part of play, in order to experience that part of play directly. Yes, this does link with method acting, trance states, flow and focus, and all the ways we shift our consciousness of what happens in play. It does this because all those pieces of how we are conscious are part of our view, and when we immerse we are either keeping them, or shutting them out. <br/><br/>Which of these do you want more examples or clarification on? <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>

                            I'd love to hear an actual play example of a player using "immersive" play controls.  What's it look like, according to your model here?  What specific decisions, actions, and statements does such a player make?                        </div>

                            What does immersion look like generally? <br/><br/>This is tied into the question of detecting views. Namely, to recognize what lies within a player's view, you need both positive information and negative information. <br/><br/>On one hand, direct interaction with her character produces supportive responses. At the same time, implicit offerings to extend the setting may be ignored. This is compelling evidence that her view contains her character, but not the setting per se. <br/><br/>As we continue this process we can develop a better understanding of a players view. However, play controls change views, most noteably immersive play controls focus and refine views. If a player attends some aspects of play at first, but then begins to ignore or become unresponsive to many aspects of play, without a corresponding shift of interest to some new aspect of play, then you can conclude that immersion is happening, and begin to guess at what view the immersion has focused into. <br/><br/>At the same time, the increased intensity from focus is often evidenced by more frequent and in depth responses to play within that view. It may even be detectable as intense emotions or a mannerisms of deep focus. Also, when the view ceases to be satisfied, there is often a period of disorientation, because the immersion has removed the alternatives for satisfaction, so the player must search for a new view, instead of changing the existing one.<br/><br/>Since immersion only talks about the scope of views, rather than the interactions with the dynamics of play, it's not really relevant to discuss specific actions descriptive of all immersion. Rather it is the scope of interaction with play that is indicates immersive play controls, not the specifics of that interaction. It is important to make the distinction between the answer to a question and when the question itself is ignored or rejected. <br/><br/>Is that method reasonably clear? <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>

                            Mendel, Joshua is asking -- and now I am too -- for an actual play example that shows this theory in action. Can you discuss an instance of role-playing where players were or were not immersed and discuss how your model applies to that <i>actual game event</i> that <i>actually occurred between real players</i>? All this theory is good. Can we see it applied?                        </div>

                            My apologies. It it excruciatingly difficult to locate transcripts with appropriate negative information. In the mean time, as I'm sure you have ample internal actual play examples, I assumed providing a method to identify when those demonstrate immersion would be a much greater use than a short, and likely very unconvincining example from my own play. <br/><br/>However, I can give you a short actual play example from after my most recent games, an on-going aberrant RPG. <br/><br/>Two of my players had verbally and mentally been quite angry towards the end of the session as they began to deal with the political aggression of Project Utopia. I inquired if they were angry with the plot. They paused, reflecting, and then one of them said he was angry with Utopia, it was clear (here you'll have to trust me, as I know both of these players rather well) he hadn't until then connected Utopia's agression with my actions, even though, as Storyteller I had entirely introduced it. It was simply an unattended part of play, as far as they were conscerned.<br/><br/>However at the beginning of that session, and periodically through out, there were meta-game questions, and references to events that I was advancing, from those two players. <br/><br/>Obviously I can only hypothesize, but this indicates a focusing of views, and hence immersion. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>

                            Mendel, it seems you're using a lot of words to say "immersion is when the players focus on their characters a lot."  What do we get when we try to apply your views to immersion?  If it doesn't give us specific actions and <em>tools</em> with which to exploit or enhance the immersive experience, I don't see why you're hitting the thesaurus so hard.<br/><br/>Do I understand correctly that when you say "play controls" you are not referring to things that players use to actually control play, but instead a descriptive set of foci that describes what they are and are not paying attention to?<br/><br/>Lastly, I think defining immersion as "not paying attention to other stuff" is probably wrong-headed.  Perhaps this is <em>an</em> immersion, but it certainly does not describe all instances of immersion, some of which is very conscious of other elements of the game.                        </div>

                            Joshua, <br/><br/>First of all, you are confusing play controls with views. Views are what is attended, play controls are how that attention is used to influence play. <br/><br/>Second, understanding the scope that a player pays attention to requires finding what is not being payed attention. That scope is fundamentally part of how and why we play, it is the view of the player. Immersion or not, "not paying attention to other stuff" is an important part of play.<br/><br/>Third, immersion does not even require a character, it is the focusing of views. Characters are wonderful tools to achieve immersion, because they are conceptually self-contained and they often can drive play without need to move outside of them. In many ways, tactical subsystems can work the same way, even down to the 'loss of self' or animated trance state. But there are other forms of immersion which are very understudied, such as those outside of the fictional or mechanical parts of play, which we can support by inducing the right dynamics (i.e. game design). In particular, if a possible subview is self-contained, in how it influences and is influenced by play, that opens the chance for immersion into that subview. <br/><br/>Lastly, your thesarus comment is perhaps, telling. What terms do you think I am simply renaming here? <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>
