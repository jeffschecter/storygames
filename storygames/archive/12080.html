Everything raw, everything smokey, everything halfway to hell before it even realizes it.<br/><br/>You\u2019ve only ever known two things: how to hold a gun steady, and how to take what ain\u2019t yours.

You\u2019re a gun thief.<br/><br/><i>Gun Thief is a game for 3 players, but can accomodate up to 4.<br/>It is diceless, gives each player a unique role, and is easy to learn.<br/><br/>Gun Thief involves violence, and probably sex.

I also assume that this sort of detailed narration wouldn't just happen to fall out of play; thus, it must be hard-wired into the game.<br/><br/>I did think the phrasing was evocative and interesting!  Just misleading for me, personally.

We "veiled" it in our play: the character were definitely having sex, but we didn't talk about it. The game contains a lot of shared narration, and I'd say it would be tough to take the narration somewhere that any one player was uncomfortable with, due to the way "interrupting" works.<br/><br/>As long as everyone is willing and eager, Gun Thief supports play ranging from "slightly zany/tragic crime stories" to "dirty sex and tragic bloodbath". No matter where you fall on the spectrum, it ends in tragedy. Ooh, it's like the Player says in<i> Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</i>: "We're more of the love, blood, and rhetoric school. Well, we can do you blood and love without the rhetoric, and we can do you blood and rhetoric without the love, and we can do you all three concurrent or consecutive. But we can't give you love and rhetoric without the blood. Blood is compulsory. They're all blood, you see."<br/><br/>I'm a bit biased, because I enjoyed the playtest AND I'm a sucker for the genre, but I'd say it's worth $3, if only for the opportunity to recreate the stories contained in <i>Criminal </i>and <i>100 Bullets</i> -- two of my favourite comic series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270791/#Comment_270791" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T08:56:57+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  8:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to see something came out of the 365 second design contest.
