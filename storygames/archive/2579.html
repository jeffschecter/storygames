Should should it be impssible to draw these pictures, for whatever reasons? Should writing something like SS in the Vineyard be impossible?</blockquote>\nThis is going to become something that should be its own thread but here we go.<br/><br/>I don't think that these pieces of art should disappear.  I just think that should be commented on, critiqued and put into context.<br/><br/>I'm not into burning art for freedom.  However, I am into speaking my mind for freedom.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Judd,<br/><br/>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>I don't think that these pieces of art should disappear.

Still, some of the outrage I've seen over stuff like Jabba the Hun or the Conan picture leaves me very, very baffled. I've been trying to put my finger on it while writing my post above, but I'm still not sure where, ultimately, the difference lies between my opinion and those of some other users here.<br/><br/>EDIT: And yeah, maybe this should go into another thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Aaron,<br/><br/>I'm not outraged.  I'm just disappointed.  It was like watching someone pitch a no-hitter and then give away a bunt in the final inning.  Um, I have no idea if a baseball metaphor would be lost on ya.

You are my "bitch."<br/><br/>Judd: YES. Well said. There are light-years of difference between saying, "I don't like that and here's how I feel about it," and "BURN IT!" I trust that people can tell the difference.<br/><br/>No censorship. Ever. That's where I stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I agree, no censorship ever.<br/><br/>I'm wondering where the calls for censorship were though. I mean, maybe I missed something as I tend to skim on these "watching posts" -- but who called for things to be censored? Jonathan and Matt pretty much said, "Ugh" and Clinton said "why ugh" and they said "Yellow Claw ugh" and Clinton said "Oh, yea, probably ugh."<br/><br/>Next thing I know we're talking about how very much we're all against censorship. So... um... I'm now like, "who said censor anything?"</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Ech, I think it was me and my bad examples. When I posted about something being "impossible", it was just in the context of my magical "If I had a Wish, I'd Wish the various Isms away" example, not about the broader Jabba the Hun discussion. I haven't seen anybody call for censorship or anything and I didn't mean to imply something like that. So I think we can skip the censorship discussion for now. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'm not outraged.  I'm just disappointed.  It was like watching someone pitch a no-hitter and then give away a bunt in the final inning.  Um, I have no idea if a baseball metaphor would be lost on ya.</blockquote>Totally. ^_^<br/><br/>I recognized most of the words in the sentence (Well, everything besides "bunt".) but it still didn't make much sense. Or, at least the bunt thing didn't. But I did get the general meaning.\n<blockquote>It was like...eating a good meal and finding a hair in the final bite.<br/><br/>Ya know?</blockquote>Yeah, I do, in a general sense. But I'm slightly puzzled what exactly was so disappointing about it. To go with the food analogy, it's a bit like saying "The food tasted great, but then that last bite: Horrible", leaving me to wonder wether you bit on a chili or a cockroach that tried to crawl back out of your throat. (And I only say that because "But what disappointed you about finding a hair in your food" is just too stupid an analogy.)<br/><br/>I mean, I don't like that picture for completly different reasons (I don't like how it'd drawn.), but I don't really get what's so disappointing about using the stereotype of the asian crimeloard. Sure, it's a stereotype, but so is any other genre convention.<br/><br/>On the danger of completly derailing the tread by making another nazi-themed analogy: Looking at the various propaganda images used by the nazis, they are obviously very offensive. But what's offensive, to me, is not really the stereotypes used (The evil Jew, whatever.), but the way in which they were used and the mindset behind the usage. I'm not offended by the picture itself, but the use the were put to and the ideology behind it. To come back to the actual topic, if the stereotype of the asian crimeloard would be used by the artist to, dunno, spread feat and hate amongst the people living next to a city part with lots of asians, then yeah, I'd be disappointed (and more) too. But by the picture itself, without this context, not really.<br/><br/>(Obviously, that's just me. I'm not posting here to convince anybody, honestly. I'm just curious what other people think.)<br/><br/>So now, in a new thread and with the censorship discussion out of the way, let the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Mortal Komba</span>... discussion <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">begin</span> continue...<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59080/#Comment_59080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T13:40:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  1:40PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2007 1:41PM by Judd.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aaron, I can't tell you when to be offended.

Here's an example, though, based on racism that I've personally experienced.  Because I'm a privileged White male, this means going halfway around the world...<br/><br/>In China, they have this term for foreigners, "lao wai," which seems pretty harmless.  "Lao" means "Old," and is used in many terms of endearment or familiarity: "Old Man Xu," "old friends, "old schoolmates," etc.  "Wai" means "outside" and is a general term for foreign things.  If you ask most Chinese people about the term "lao wai," most people will describe it as a term of respect or familiarity.  To them, it doesn't really seem to have any racist connotations.  After all, it describes all sorts of people, from all kinds of cultural or national backgrounds.<br/><br/>However, if you look at the way Chinese people actually use the term "lao wai," you get a pretty different picture.  Now, anti-White racism in China is nowhere near as bad as anti-Black racism, don't get me wrong.  There were race riots in Nanjing in the 80's when African students were viewed as taking advantage of (or just polluting) Chinese women.  And there have been riots related to China's own Muslim population.  But, when it comes to "lao wai" in practice, it almost always applies to people of European descent.  In other cases (at least, in my experience), Chinese people tend to use more specific terms: Black people, Japanese, South Americans, Arabs, Southeast Asians, Indians, etc.<br/><br/>And when people use the term "lao wai" as opposed to the more proper "waiguo ren" ("people from foreign nations) it's almost always in a dismissive or negative fashion.  Part of that has to do with how unspecific the term is.  It implies "I don't know where you're from, but I can tell you're foreign by looking at you."  And this kind of usage happens daily, all around you, as you walk down the street.  The most common being: "Look, a lao wai!"  So this is a definite case where the way the term is actually used is very different from the way people think about the term or possibly even their intentions.  They're not necessarily intending to make people feel like circus freaks, but that's what ends up happening.<br/><br/>So, to bring this back to Jabba...<br/><br/>I hate people using ethnic stereotypes to depict evil or exotic characters.  Period.  Equating ethnicity with evil or sneaky intentions has a long history (like the Yellow Peril), all of which fucking sucks.  Also, ethnicity does not make you exotic.  I look pretty unusual when I'm in China, being an ethnic European, but I am not a stranger there.  I speak Chinese fluently.  I can discuss politics and recent events with people and sing along to popular music.  Likewise, Shreyas and Dev come from a South Asian ethnic background, but basically they're just awesome nerdy kids from Jersey.  Equating or associating appearance (race, gender, etc.) with culture and personality is hella dumb.<br/><br/>People are complicated.  Things like race and ethnicity and gender and nationality and sexuality and culture are important components that people use when constructing their identities (or having their identities constructed for them and then impressed upon them), but no one wants to feel like a walking cliche.  People constantly break with traditions and act out.  There are thousands of studies of deviant behavior that talk about this.  This is also how new traditions get created, because a few individuals make decisions to do things differently and the results are really neat.<br/><br/>Roleplaying has the potential to celebrate the complexity and diversity of people and the world, which I find to be one of its most beautiful characteristics.  Too often, though, like people everywhere, we reach for the "easy answers," the stereotypes, the generalizations that aren't actually correct.  And that just sucks.<br/><br/>So yeah.<br/><br/>Censorship also sucks.  If he took down that picture of Jabba then we wouldn't get an opportunity to talk about racism.  It would just be sweeping things under the rug and pretending like everything was cool.  But everything isn't cool and conversation, changing people's understandings a little bit at a time, is the only way it's ever going to get better.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not sure if that helps any, but there are some of my thoughts.  It always feels kinda weird to be a straight white middle-class American male attempting to fight racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, and bigotry of all kinds.  I don't want to co-opt other people's struggle and water it down with my own limited perspective, but this shit affects all of us in the long run (like Brand said recently in his post on how misogyny hurts men too) and we all need to do what we can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59118/#Comment_59118" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T15:42:53+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  3:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... we have a thread - might as well dare use it... <br/><br/>So... last time this issue of bigotry in art came up (over on Websnark, IIRC), it vexxed me, for much the same reason as Aaron points out above, and I spent some time thinking about it for myself.

My initial read of the picture was more of an Arabian Nights or Ottoman Empire character, what with the turban and with Tattooine being a desert planet.  Not that it would be a better kind of racism if it is indeed racism, but it just goes to show it's not exactly 100% obvious for all viewers.  I'm just not sure either way, but "not sure" is usually a good flag for "use caution."<br/><br/>As an aside, I am a bit amused (wrily), given the discussions on various blogs and mailing lists over the last couple of weeks about sexism in pulp-based games.

So it's hard to have things that are exotic without being based on stereotypes.  Even space aliens and fantasy races are generally based on European racial/cultural stereotypes.  That said, I think there can be depictions of people outside of your own racial and cultural background that are not inherently racist, but, like Chris is trying to point out, I think doing that often requires talking to the people you are interested in depicting or, better yet, getting them involved in the project from the start.<br/><br/>For example, I was trying to explain <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> to these folks on a Chinese-language roleplaying forum.  I condescendingly thought that if I re-wrote it as a short game about Lord Bao, a famous Chinese judge, that it's be easier for them to get it.  They were like, "Uh, just give us the Mormons."  So my job is basically to try to understand Chinese people and I still totally fucked it up.  But if I hadn't had that conversation with them, I wouldn't have learned anything.  But then a few people were interested in working on a China-centric version of the game and, since they knew a whole lot more than me about Chinese history and culture, they had some great suggestions.  Nothing ended up coming of it, but it was something I learned a lot from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59136/#Comment_59136" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T18:18:20+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  6:18PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>If we don't, why do people still use it to sell to us?</blockquote>\nYeah, <i>Pirates of the Caribbean 2</i>.

That is, a story can be good and yet express attitudes you disagree with.  <br/><br/>I think many people hold to this belief that racism is something rare and totally alien to all the normal, good people around them.  But really, racism is something which shows up in perfectly good stories.  For example, Lovecraft is a terrific storyteller, but he also is filled with racism which is quite blatant in his stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59162/#Comment_59162" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T04:00:48+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  4:00AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite>My conclusion was, and is, basically that the people, like myself, who look at<a href="http://blog.wired.com/photos/uncategorized/picture_27_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>and doesn't start to think "ugh" until someone else says "hey, that's totally 'ugh', because XYZ, etc"...<br/><br/>...well, my theory is that we're basically, well,<i>racist</i>*...<br/><br/>Not intellectually, and surley not because we want to be... but because we are - it's where we come from, its that historical left-over, that dark cloud dancing around our ideals...<br/></blockquote>Hmmm...<br/><br/>Now, this might sound awefully naive and I fully expect to get totally flamed for it, but: I don't feel very racist. ^_^<br/><br/>Obviously, few people who are racist think they are, but when I think back on my life, I... gah, kinda grasping for words here... I never tried to be conciously "non-racist", but when looking back I do feel like I'm pretty much color-blind. Like, I have a hard time picking out the racial aspects of situations or the people I interact with. I only realized on concious reflection that a large part, maybe even the majority of my friends throughout life have been immigrants or children of immigrants, and that this might actually be unusual for some people. It always takes me longer to see racial stereotypes then other people and most of the time I'm not aware that this is supposed to be a stereotype for something. As in "People say [group of people X] is like that? Fucked-up...". Stupid example: When I read about Jar-Jar Bings being criticised as stereotypical Jamaican (IIRC.), I really didn't understand it, because I literally didn't see the connection. I had no real image of what Jamaicans are "supposed to be like" so only after reading up on the stereotype I "got" the criticism. (Though I think that "Stupid comic relief character" is a better/more accurate criticism. And the one time where the character was criticised for "being gay" still leaves me all ?_?)<br/><br/>(Which brings me back to my original post, in which I wondered in how the cultural differences between me being austrian and many other people here being american influences things. I often feel that the issues of racism vary greatly between different nations/cultures. Like, here in austria literal "race" as in white/black/blue tends to be less of an issue then nationality, ie. where people come from and so on. Wonder how that influenced my view of things...)<br/><br/>Anyway, to come back to the "awefully naive" part: Could my reaction to things and my blind spot be because I'm racist or part of an established racist system? Yeah, sure. But I'd like to think that it might be that, for me, a persons race, or nationality, is less of an issue. Throughout my whole life, I've interacted with people of all different nationalities and races and only in retrospect realized that this unusual, at least for some people. I could still be a horrible racist, I guess, and I think that would be for the other people around me to judge based on my actions. (Kinda hard to be you own objective observer.)

(Convoluted sentence; I hope it still makes sense.)<br/>I mean, I see why drawing an oriental character in that way is insulting, but I can't see why drawing Fu Manchu that way is insulting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59206/#Comment_59206" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T08:20:33+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  8:20AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jasper, <br/><br/>I don't care much about authorial intent.

Who knows why he painted as he did? Maybe he had good reasons, maybe he didn't. Maybe he can draw well, maybe he can't. I'll probably never know, and I really don't care. It isn't about him, its about the effect of the art. <br/><br/>As for Fu Manchu, that all depends.

It's like Matt says, it's the question of whether, for the benefit of our fellow players and to be respectful of the diversity of people around us, we will stop depicting things that they tell us (because we may not always be able to see it) are really offensive to them.  That just seems like basic politeness to me.  It's not a censorship issue; it's not about freedom of speech.  Clearly people have the right to be cruel to each other.  But choosing not to, in my mind, makes you a better person.

This one Asian sorcerer woman isn't (in the context of D&amp;D) special because of her exotic, alienated, other nature... she's commonplace.<br/><br/>Look at D&amp;D monster manuals. There are hundreds of creatures with absolutely no human capacity to them. In a game like The Shadow of Yesterday I'd portray all those monsters sympathetically, like misguided creatures or wounded animals. In D&amp;D, I'd play them like targets to kill.<br/><br/>Now look at something like Complete Adventurer (ninja), Complete Warrior (prestige class: drunken master), or another supplement. The Asian-based classes are mystical (as opposed to concretely magical), sneaky (as opposed to stealthy), and <i>different</i>. It isn't that hard to find depictions of other races, either. Barbarian, for example.<br/><br/>Now... I have no problem with a game like D&amp;D taking races and providing very caricature-y depictions of them in this fantasy world. After all, Greyhawk (et al.) is a simpler world that parallels our own in very distinct ways. Whatever. What I do have a problem with is when those depictions are lumped into us and them categories.<br/><br/>So, yeah. In response to that Asian lady picture: I see nothing that sets it apart from the rest of d&amp;d. The problem is a bit more expansive than a single pic.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>PS.

This really twigged me out, as well as some friends of mine, because I didn't like my con being dragged down by a guy who looked like the folks that ruthlessly murdered a quarter of my family tree, and robbed blind and exiled another quarter.<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with whether the guy himself was an anti-semite.  I'm sure he wasn't.  It also doesn't have anything to do with the fact that this particular outfit was from an element of fandom (I think it was WH40K).  It's just that seeing that shit drags down my con.  I start thinking about the cousins and uncles that I never met, and the enormous suffering of those that did survive, and the guy I met at my grandfather's funeral with tattoos on his arm, and so on and so forth, which frankly I could do without.  Further, I have to restrain the urge to deck the guy, repeatedly, because he's made himself into a symbol of the forces that did that.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd rather be playing some games.<br/><br/>As it happens, this resolved rather well.  I talked with the Dreamation staff about it (with the support of another Jewish friend of mine), and the staff said "oh, man, we didn't even think about it.  We'll talk with him."  I don't know if he was either off the staff or out of the uniform, but at this most recent dreamation I didn't see him (and I wouldn't recognize him out of the uniform -- it wasn't him I was reacting to, but the way he was dressed.)<br/><br/>This isn't a question of rights.  Does he have a right to wear that uniform?  Absolutely!  It's a matter of courtesy.  Like I wouldn't rail about war politics when someone who had a family member in Iraq was in the room, unless they brought it up first.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59235/#Comment_59235" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T09:58:37+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  9:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>D&amp;D has always portrayed the white, European adventurer and the Other.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>So, pervasive racism excuses a specific case?</p>\n<p>Man what</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59237/#Comment_59237" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:00:44+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:00AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to be clear -- we're all on the same page that RPG art is horribly SEXIST, right?

Chris's picture is from a D&amp;D supplement, where over-the-top cheesecake is explicitly banned by WotC policies (although they still sneak it in when they can).  If it were White Wolf, which has a very different style guide, it might look a little more like <a href="http://boardgameclub.co.uk/images/WW8805.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but changing the horse's color doesn't make it a different animal.<br/><br/>If anything, the most obvious sign that the artist disrespected Chris's poor wu jen is that she isn't sexualized AT ALL.<br/><br/>I think Chris is being a little extreme here, as always, but Walton's on the money.

Now, I know I'm prone to hear things that aren't intended, which is why I'm bringing this up.  Personally, I don't want to see racism (or any bigotry) glorified in fiction.  But I think that's a pretty weak statement.  For instance, I don't see anything wrong with reading 20's pulp and accepting the casual racism as part of a different (and I can't help but think "benighted") culture.  I'd go as far (and have) as playing bigoted characters, in service to a story, or to experiment with that point of view.  I see that as more affirming of my own views on race and culture than a hard line stance condemning the material entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59239/#Comment_59239" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:03:49+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:03AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson --<br/><br/>Who's actually saying that?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59241/#Comment_59241" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:06:08+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:06AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 10:10AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have given a lot of thought to racism in gaming as well as its next door neighbor, sexism, and its upstairs tenant, political prejudices and assumptions.<br/><br/>This is as a result of sharing a birthday with Sax Rohmer, author of the Fu Manchu novels, which I have read and collected and enjoyed thoroughly.<br/><br/>"How can you read and enjoy that racist stuff, JDCorley?" you ask. "You are one of those liberal mealy mouth hippies who believes in the Bill of Rights and will probably be interned at Guantanamo once the coup happens. You work with highly diverse people in a highly diverse population, you see with your own eyes every day the unbelievable intergenerational horror that results from institutionalized racism, and you know for a fact that fictions like Rohmers are part of the problem, that they perpetuate a myth even if they're presented as fiction, you know all this and you still like reading them?"<br/><br/>I go further than that, I see nothing wrong with using an Asian master-villain stereotype in a pulp adventure game if the players are all right with it.<br/><br/>Here are some examples. Assume I have been tapped to run a cops-and-criminals game.<br/><br/>Game 1: Designed to depict a highly diverse population, scrupulously avoids stereotyping, issues of race and racism are addressed realistically.  (The Shield).<br/>Game 2: Although most of the main characters are white, race is occasionally an issue addressed semi-realistically but not in any great depth. (Law &amp; Order).<br/>Game 3: Although most of the main characters are white, racial issues are presented primarily as a complication to an already difficult situation.  There is no real analysis of the concern, it is simply presented. (tokenism)<br/>Game 4: Race is simply not addressed and the game is played with our out-of-character middle class racial attitudes implicit in the game.<br/>Game 5: The characters in the game, be they PCs or NPCs, respond and appear in ways according with racial stereotypes, although they aren't caricatures.<br/>Game 6: The game is overt race propaganda in which the denigrated race is portrayed in the most twisted, vile ways imaginable. (such as <a href="http://www.superdickery.com/propaganda/1.html" rel="nofollow">Golden Age supers or war comics</a> et. seq.)<br/><br/>In looking over these games, I see the <i>most objectionable</i> game as being <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, even more so than <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because it is <i>unconscious.</i><br/><br/>When I read Sax Rohmer's books, I read them not as he wrote them or as a contemporary might have read them, but as I, JDCorley, mealy mouthed hippie living in 2007 in Arizona.  That is not to say that I don't have racist impulses, of course I do, I'm a middle class child of white privilege, but when I read Rohmer (or the Arabian Nights or any number of other highly racist historical texts) I try to be as conscious as possible about what it is I'm reading - to read critically, so to speak. Actually I try to do that with everything I read.<br/><br/>I see nothing wrong with a game that adopts points of view that the players find repugnant or even vile so long as they do it voluntarily and consciously.  For example, I don't think that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> would be a very fun game, so I wouldn't choose to do it. <br/><br/>But if you replace race with politics, I am running game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> right now, the <a href="http://tenebrous.scarymonsters.net" rel="nofollow">Project Tenebrous</a> game I mentioned in another thread. If you are running any kind of superspy or commando game, you are doing a game in which the conservative stereotype of world politics is accurate and unquestioned.  The reason spies aren't like James Bond is not because we couldn't train them to be if we wanted to - it's because the world doesn't work like the world of James Bond.  Vanilla D&amp;D is the conservative view of the Old West.  <br/><br/>Now I think the conservative stereotype of world politics is dead wrong and extremely dangerous, I think it's produced rivers of blood and squandered mountains of treasure, and I know a big part of its perpetuation is that it has dominated American mythmaking and storytelling for so long.  That doesn't mean every time someone, meaning me, entertains the fantasy, they're agreeing with the premises.  It means they're playing "what if" and watching what happens as an audience.<br/><br/>This doesn't get the artist (or in the case of RPGs, the players) off the hook. They're still responsible for what they produce. I just think that you <i>can take that responsibility.</i><br/><br/>This is a little bit of a threadcrap because I dislike damn near all art in all gaming books ever and consider it to be a waste of perfectly good space that I could use for, say, writing notes on. But the basis of the objection is the same and actually a little stronger against written game materials than against visual materials.<br/><br/>In conclusion: I blame the patriarchy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59245/#Comment_59245" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:11:56+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:11AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 10:15AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson, <br/><br/>It isn't an issue of having racism in a game, its an issue of the game being racist. <br/><br/>Having a game in which you play slaves and slave owners in the Antebellum south is cool. No one is arguing against that. In fact I'd really like such a game if it got right into the root of the horrible racism, economics, and personal beliefs that made that system such a nightmare. <br/><br/>Having a game in which black characters get a -2 to INT is not cool. But I don't think that anyone is arguing that either. At least, I hope to heaven no one is. <br/><br/>But what about having a game in which you say, "you can play anyone of any race" but in which there is no talk about race, no example PCs who are anything but white, and lots and lots of NPC threats who are an Asian yellow peril, a black power activist gone too far, and no womenz but femme fatals? Or a game in which you play masters but not slaves because the players of the game are all assumed to be white and there is no way they could empathize with the black slaves, who are just too different?<br/><br/>I mean, at least that would be saying something deliberate, even if its kinda.... But when you just have yellow peril pictures that you don't even know are yellow peril pictures because that's just how you draw an Asian?<br/><br/>Crosspost Edit: As JD says, it isn't about consciously dealing with racism, its about the problems of not dealing with it at all despite the fact that it is still there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59248/#Comment_59248" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:24:43+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:24AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Brand &amp; Ben, okay.

He was a crimelord. His role in fiction was about the same as Jabba's role in Starwars. I'm pretty sure the artist picked him because of that, not because it would be amusing to draw a stereotype. He's not referencing the <i>stereotype</i>, he's referencing the <i>character</i>.<br/><br/>There is a difference between drawing the Fu Manchu Yellow Peril stereotype, and drawing Fu Manchu.<br/><br/>I don't think it's the same as your example with the jew. It's more like, you draw a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi as Dracula, and I say it's full of Slavic stereotypes.<br/><br/><b>Jonathan</b>: I want to check this first, because English isn't my first language so I might get confused: When I say "ignorant", and you say "They're not necessarily intending to make people feel like circus freaks, but that's what ends up happening.", we're talking about the same thing, right?<br/><br/>Because if it is, <i>of course </i>it's about the intent of the artist. Judd talked about Alan Moore earlier: Fu Manchu appears in his League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Does that make the comic racist? I think not.<br/>Then why is the Starwars pic racist?<br/><br/><b>Chris</b>: Fair enough. Like I said, I think the ugliness of the woman is mostly because the artist cannot draw. As for the rest, I took it in the same stride as the rest of D&amp;D art: The orientalism in that picture is about as accurate as the knights in D&amp;D are medieval, so I shrugged it of.<br/><br/>Edit: crossposted with a whole lot of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59255/#Comment_59255" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:44:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:44AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the support, Pigeon, but I think Chris is right on the money.<br/><br/>I feel like I also need to say that "I don't see it because (or therefore) I'm not racist" doesn't really follow.  I tend to think that not noticing prejudice means you're not sensitized to it, which could mean 1) you've never really had to think about racism and/or 2) you've internalized the system of racism to the point that it doesn't bother you.  Same goes for sexism too and various other things.  I don't mean this as an insult or accusation against those who are making that argument, just an opportunity for honest self-reflection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders" title="Anders"><img alt="Anders" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders">Anders</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59261/#Comment_59261" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:51:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sort of love you for saying that, Jonathan.

See, I don't really buy it. Fu Manchu was the Yellow Peril, the character was a walking list of racial stereotypes. Bringing up the character brings up those stereotypes -- especially when you use some of those stereotypes as the way in which you bring him up. Similarly, I don't buy that you could remake C3P0 as Uncle Tom and be talking just about Uncle Tom the character and being subservient. I think that making it over into the image of a character who basically is a walking racial stereotype is problematic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

For example, check out <a href="http://www.milehighcomics.com/cgi-bin/backissue.cgi?action=fullsize&amp;issue=47378076020%206" rel="nofollow">this cover</a>, which includes the blurbs: "Discover the courageous plan of crafty Johnny Chinaman!"  There's even worse stuff on the inside.  I wish I had my copy.  But I think Moore may be misjudging a significant portion of his audience there, who may not understand that he's ridiculing racism instead of glorifying it.  So there's inherent danger in that approach.<br/><br/>Can you draw Fu Manchu without it being racist?  I tend to think not.  That would be like saying you can tell racist jokes without it being racist.  The character is inherently racist, from his name to his appearance to his behavior.  So if you're going to depict Fu Manchu, you're inherently saying something about racism.  Alan Moore attempts to ridicule racism by depicting horrible stereotypes, as does Gene Yang in <a href="http://www.firstsecondbooks.com/abc.html" rel="nofollow">American Born Chinese</a>.  Now we can compare the success they have in doing this, but both of them aren't trying to avoid the racist overtones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59268/#Comment_59268" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T11:03:09+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 11:03AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jasper,<br/><br/>Two things to consider:<br/><br/>1.  The question is, does the inaccuracy paint heroes as positive or negative?  I don't mind fantastic inaccuracy, my question is why does the negative inaccuracy only fall on POC?  <br/><br/>2.  Fu Manchu was a stereotype against asians, just in the same way, "I was just referencing Sambo" doesn't hold up as a defense.  The fear was that asians were corrupting America through vice, though the real trigger that led to running Chinese out of town, lynchings and burning shops was the miscegenation hysteria.  (Which was also pretty much the same BS that opened the floodgates to lynchings of black people during the Reconstruction).<br/><br/>The really bothersome part about all of this is that these images aren't being used as poking the ignorance of the past, but just repeating it.<br/><br/>And really, what am I supposed to say to the non-gamer who I'm trying to introduce to gaming when they see this image that mocks them?  "Dude, this is an example of your <i>heroic idealized character in a game of escapism</i>?"<br/><br/>I can deal with the ignorance of the publishers OR the ignorance of gamer culture, but when you mix the two, it really makes it a place people of color don't want to be.<br/><br/>But then again, someone once asked me, "Why <i>should</i> we care about people of color?"<br/>To which the answer is the same as "Why <i>should</i> we care about people <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of color</span>?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59269/#Comment_59269" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T11:09:05+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 11:09AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree that ignorance is a serious obstacle to overcome in these situations.

Through that lens of the SR game world, you can play scenarios that ask how far we have really come since then.<br/><br/>(And if you want to ignore all that and just play D&amp;D with guns, there's that option.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59296/#Comment_59296" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T12:35:13+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 12:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"On its own it's not really 'racist' at all."</i><br/><br/>Really?

"I don't want him to play a woman just for the sake of playing a woman, but if he has a good reason, I'll allow it." is often heard. Would that person ever say "I don't want him to play a man just for the sake of playing a man, but if he has a good reason, I'll allow it." Usually no. But it's a damn good question to raise.  Why do you want your character to be male, white, wealthy, etc.?  The question adds to character design and verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Whenever I have a character now, I try to cook up in my own head what benefits or drawbacks they've gained or suffered as a result of being whatever race or sex or sexual orientation or religion.  It always really adds to the character even if he's just as whitebread middle class as I am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Poulton" title="Eric Poulton"><img alt="Eric Poulton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Poulton">Eric Poulton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59318/#Comment_59318" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T13:27:33+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  1:27PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys, this is the artist behind Jabba.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of you bring up a lot of good points, and I tend to agree with you. My illustration of Jabba can be interpreted as negatively stereotypical.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intentions were not to depict Jabba <i>himself</i> as foreign and exotic, but to depict him as someone who flaunts his wealth by dressing himself and his palace in foreign and exotic items (mainly Asian, but with some Arabic influences mixed in). But in retrospect, I think I confused the depiction by giving him the Fu Manchu mustache, which implied that he <i>was</i> Asian rather than he was just dressed in Asian clothing. I failed to consider the connotations of it (and to tell you the truth, I only put it on him because it made him look more like a catfish). Unintentional stereotypes are just as harmful as intentional ones, and it's something I have to be more critical of in my own work in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the criticism!

There are several critics who have found new things in the Fu Manchu character as well.  If you read those books you can see not only that the narrator/author is using caricature to create Fu Manchu, but is absolutely fascinated by him - he uses a totally overblown physical description of him the first time he appears and then in the second book, <i>uses the exact same description, word for word.</i>  (!) <br/><br/>In addition, in a highly bizarre sort of homage/letter from the author to his creation, Rohmer concluded by saying that perhaps a world in which Fu Manchu was ascendant might not be such a bad world after all and might actually be better in a lot of ways. It's this fascination (obsession?) and the ability to empathize with the Terrible Oriental Villain that makes the Fu Manchu books live on when dozens of imitators and other Yellow Peril pulp fiction have long since been consigned to the dust.  In my view, anyway. (And some other critics.)<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59359/#Comment_59359" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T15:45:26+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  3:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>Also, I think I disagree with your suggestion that Shylock is a basically two-dimensional caricature the way that Fu Manchu is.

Studying books and taking classes on culture helps as well, especially to background what you're finding out in your talking, but its the actually listening to real people that does you the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59432/#Comment_59432" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T23:03:35+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 11:03PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>But in my considered opinion, Chris's picture is a very minor example.

Single.  One.<br/><br/>Not one of thos pics would I call shlocky.  They are fucking awesome and make me want to play in the fucking Realms fer heaven's sake.  <br/><br/>The picture that Chris had linked, looks to me, like some kind of awful charicature from the 20's of what mainstream U.S. culture liked to portray as Asian.  All it needed was buck teeth to make the protrayal common in that time period complete.  It isn't a curb stomp from white supremacist nor is it a racist baseball bat beating but as gamers/posters/equal-participants-in-a-hobby-of-equals we can demand more and we can criticize.<br/><br/>And here we are, doing just that.  <br/><br/>And there's been a string of forum roadblocks to make a mess of it on all sides.<br/><br/>No, I won't just silently not buy a product whose art I find butt-ignorant and walk away.  Eff that.  <br/><br/>My primary purpose for using any forum is to share my good times.  I love doing that.  But another important purpose is to criticize what we see around us, not in a negative just for the sake of being negative way, but because we want to see changes made that will make the hobby better and make the fiction stronger.<br/><br/>Stereotypes and racist charicatures are rooted in ignorance.  There is nothing wrong with ignorance.  There is something wrong with not listening to ignorance when it is criticized and refusing to listen.  I'm not asking for some kind of "Wow, Judd/Brand/Shreyas/Chris/Etc., I have read your words and you WIN, I see the light" miraculous instant change.  I'm asking for an open ear and an open mind.<br/><br/>The artist who drew Jabba, I thought he handled himself quite well.  He thanks us for taking the time to give honest criticism and saw his way out.  Awesome.  He heard.  The wheels are turning.  That is all I can ask.<br/><br/>All I am asking is that artists who are putting their work out into the world listen.  Because the only thing standing in the way of ignorance is laziness and lazy-minded people make for piss-poor fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59434/#Comment_59434" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T23:18:08+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 11:18PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Judd, I find those pics pretty schlocky, not to say kitsch.

Confronting or questioning racism isn't something that comes at the end and has someone check it.  It's a part of what goes into the work.  I would say just talk to your friends about Indonesia, what it's like, and so forth.  If it's set in a historical period, talk to them about the history they learned.  <br/><br/>For example, I talked with a friend of mine from work about China and the Taiping Revolution over lunch -- since my next campaign is set near there.

I have several Indonesian friends, but I suspect approaching them and saying, "Read this and tell me if it's racist, seeing as you're one of my token Indonesian friends" won't go over so well. My anthropology teacher-assistant was in Indonesia for a few years, but I suspect asking him to learn about RPGs and then critically assess my work is asking a lot.</blockquote>\nI think don't treat it like a spelling check which they sign off on. Confronting or questioning racism isn't something that comes at the end and has someone check it. It's a part of what goes into the work. I would say just talk to your friends about Indonesia, what it's like, and so forth. If it's set in a historical period, talk to them about the history they learned. <br/><br/>For example, I talked with a friend of mine from work about China and the Taiping Revolution over lunch -- since my next campaign is set near there. I was interested in what he had learned about the Taiping going to school in China. </blockquote>\nOkay, so my examples were kind of intentionally polarized to point out the difficulty I find in approaching people on topics of race/etc.<br/><br/>Thanks for mentioning the spelling check thing, but it's not exactly what I was intending to illustrate with my example.<br/><br/>I find that trying to include someone in a process BECAUSE they have a first-hand experience, or because they are of the same race/gender/religion/etc can come across as extremely patronizing. Getting my Indonesian friends to provide some kind of insight when designing a game based in Indonesia would feel very awkward and intrusive to me. And probably to them as well, if I were to do it in any of the ways I can envision.<br/><br/>So I'm asking for a concrete way of bridging into such a conversation.<br/><br/>Can you get into more concrete detail about how you bring up the Taiping Revolution and China to a coworker from China? I'm asking for like... either "Good sentences to use" as well as more overall approaches.<br/><br/>I feel like a patronizing "white man" when I make even the most genuine outreach effort... and knowing a good process/approach would be really useful.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59464/#Comment_59464" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T00:27:04+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 12:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Can I think about it?</blockquote>\nThat would be awesome.<br/><br/>This rapid fire response shit always ends in flames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59470/#Comment_59470" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T00:55:05+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 12:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For one, I wanted to highlight that neither Chris nor Shreyas have a monopoly on the point of view of 'people of colour' (one of the most absurd phrases I have ever heard, by the way). I am a brown man in a white man's country, to put it in plainer language, and I've lived here for thirty-four years. I'm allowed to talk.<br/><br/>Chris is implicitly dismissing my opinion in advance when he says his piece, so I don't see what the big deal is. That's what happens with differences of opinion. Chris doesn't get a free pass from argument because he's Asian; because guess what, I am too.<br/><br/>When you've actually been abused, spat on and beaten up, a ridiculous illustration from a ridiculously caricatured game is pretty small cheese, so let's keep it in perspective.<br/><br/>In any case, what I'm saying is not "I think that your perception is incorrect", it's more like "I think your consciousness is limited."</blockquote>\nOh, okay.  So you're not saying "get over it," you're saying "grow up."  That's a lot better.  Thanks for making that clarification.<br/><br/>(I am also vaguely amused by your pretty explicit implication that none of the people who are upset about this have EVER faced any kind of more serious racism, or they wouldn't be bitching.)<br/><br/>(Okay, maybe amused is the wrong word.)<br/><br/>The distinction between Chris's statement and your statement is that Chris is making a statement about his perception, and you are making a statement about the validity of his perception.<br/><br/>I also want to point out that, aside from you, NOBODY is talking about their personal race in this thread, so I'm not sure why you would feel compelled to do so.\n<blockquote>You know, D&amp;D already had Oriental Adventures back in whenever. If you guys don't like this shit then don't buy it. But you do, and you play it too. And some of you played Legend of the Five Rings, which thought it would be a good idea to give the mash-together treatment to Oriental lands. And then there's Exalted.</blockquote>\nI don't fucking buy it.  Get a handle on your second-person plural.

Jonathan, Chris, thanks for making your points clearer to me. I think it's like Aaron said: We Europians really don't understand American racial issues. Racial issues here (I'm in the Netherlands) are very different than in the US, and stereotyping in the media isn't much of a problem here.<br/><br/>Jeff isn't the only one making a cnnection between fantasy cliches and racist stereotyping, though. We just had a thread "Why do we keep returning to fantasy?", and the most common answer was "because it's easy to betray." Now we have a thread "why do we keep seeing easy betrayals of people of color?"<br/>I really think you cannot keep refering to roleplaying as "geeky" and "nerdy" and at the same time wonder why it seems to be targeting white males with poor social skills.

Getting my Indonesian friends to provide some kind of insight when designing a game based in Indonesia would feel very awkward and intrusive to me. And probably to them as well, if I were to do it in any of the ways I can envision.<br/><br/>So I'm asking for a concrete way of bridging into such a conversation.<br/><br/>Can you get into more concrete detail about how you bring up the Taiping Revolution and China to a coworker from China?

I don't recall exactly, but I think we were just sitting and talking over lunch, and I asked "Do you know anything about the Taiping Revolution?"  I explained that it came up in a game I was playing.  We talked a bit.  At some point, I think I commented that I suspected how they taught about it in China might be different from how they taught about it in the U.S.  <br/><br/>I guess starting with a question is good, as opposed to assuming they know something based on their ethnicity.  But it doesn't seem at all patronizing to me to suspect that someone from Indonesia would know more about Indonesia than me who's not -- at least enough to ask.  <br/><br/>I wonder - is your worry that you will seem ignorant in some way?  If so, it might help to read a bunch about Indonesia - though you were probably doing that anyway.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><br/>I feel like a patronizing "white man" when I make even the most genuine outreach effort... and knowing a good process/approach would be really useful.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?</blockquote>\nI don't know of any trick or secret phrasing here.

That way when I have something specific I want their feedback on its part of an ongoing conversation and not "here check my book because though we've never talked about this before I want to now but only in the context of what is important to me." If its something that is part of your life and something you do regularly and have a good reputation about its something that is much easier to do. <br/><br/>Of course, if you're regularly talking to people about such issues, even when not on point, you'll also find that you can start to avoid a lot of mistakes in the first place. At this point in my life I don't always have a South Asian friend or contact (as someone said, just talking to your friends is limiting, there is a reason they're your friends) look over everything I write about India. I do sometimes, but often I don't because... well, because I've had probably tens of thousands of those conversations, and at this point I'm usually good with going forward. It only becomes an issue when someone tells me I've screwed it, and then I listen and do better the next time. <br/><br/>The final truth is that sometimes it will be uncomfortable. Sometimes it will go badly. But over time you do get better at it, and it becomes easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59657/#Comment_59657" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T12:19:54+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 12:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s see if I can recast this in terms that helped me make sense of it, and may help others to do so as well.<br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try to unearth a few buried assumptions while I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m at it, setting my thoughts out step by step.<br/><br/>1.\tImages and words are not simply themselves, and are not simply what they are in their present context. They carry associations from other contexts. This is part of what we mean by \xe2\u20ac\u0153culture\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/>2.\tThe culture of the West has changed dramatically in the course of the past century.<br/>3.\tOne of the most significant changes has been that people who are not white heterosexual males have gained much greater access to have their voices heard within the culture.<br/>4.\tHistorically, it has usually been the case that people who were not white heterosexual males were represented within Western culture as \xe2\u20ac\u0153other\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and quite literally alienated (\xe2\u20ac\u0153alien\xe2\u20ac\x9d meaning \xe2\u20ac\u0153other\xe2\u20ac\x9d here). <br/>5.\tThe \xe2\u20ac\u0153other,\xe2\u20ac\x9d within any culture, is often an object of fear, hatred, persecution and oppression, and is represented by stereotypes which serve, in part, to dehumanize and, again, alienate.<br/>6.\tSince cultural productions reflect the culture which produces them, past Western cultural productions frequently represent the \xe2\u20ac\u0153other\xe2\u20ac\x9d in these ways. <br/>7.\tAs a result of this process, certain words and images used in those cultural productions have gained negative associations from those usages. (Think about how Rudyard Kipling stopped using the swastika \xe2\u20ac\u201c a positive symbol in Indian tradition \xe2\u20ac\u201c on the covers of his books after it became associated with Nazism.) <br/>8.\tThese associations are particularly strong, and problematic, to members of the groups who were alienated. (Ben\xe2\u20ac\u2122s example of the SS uniform.)<br/>9.\tPeople without the same cultural context \xe2\u20ac\u201c including people in the West who are not part of an alienated group, or not part of a particular alienated group \xe2\u20ac\u201c may not have the same associations and may look at the same words and images and not see anything problematic. (This is why an Australian, an Austrian and, indeed, an American looked at the Jabba picture and said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Eh? Racist? Why?\xe2\u20ac\x9d.)<br/>10.\tThis can lead to a situation where person A says \xe2\u20ac\u0153I find this problematic\xe2\u20ac\x9d and person B says \xe2\u20ac\u0153Huh? I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t, what are you talking about?\xe2\u20ac\x9d and this, in turn, gives rise to associations in person A of the alienation of not having one\xe2\u20ac\u2122s voice taken seriously in the cultural conversation \xe2\u20ac\u201c whether or not that is actually the intent. <br/>11.\tThere are several ways to respond to the problematic associations which these words and images have for some people. One is, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Well, I acknowledge that this is problematic for some people, but it isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t problematic for <i>us</i>, so we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll just set that aside and enjoy the associations that we have.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Another is, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Well, I consider \xe2\u20ac\u02dcus\xe2\u20ac\u2122 to include people who aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t present who are members of alienated groups, and I consider it appropriate to look at this problematic material as problematic.\xe2\u20ac\x9d A third is, \xe2\u20ac\u0153This material is problematic so we won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go there; these cultural productions are now off-limits because of their associations, regardless of any other merit they may possess.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>An example. Shakespeare\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Taming of the Shrew. An important cultural production; at the same time, a very problematic piece of material for contemporary audiences, since its basic story is of a woman who won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t submit to male authority (presented as a bad thing) being forced to do so (presented as a good thing). <br/><br/>I went to a production of this at a university a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. The company had chosen to address the problematic material creatively, by crossdressing the entire cast. All female parts were played by men (as they would have been in Shakespeare\xe2\u20ac\u2122s own production), but all the male parts were played by women. It could have been pretentious and too-clever-by-half, like a lot of \xe2\u20ac\u0153deconstructions\xe2\u20ac\x9d, but it wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t.

Chris's original statement was:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Why do we still have racist depictions in rpg art, given that roleplaying was born post Civil Rights Movement?</div>\n</blockquote>\nThat seems like a bald statement of fact to me.  My gut reaction was "Yes, a little bit, but not as much as you seem to be indicating" - and I try specifically to not be dismissive of opinions like this.  But I'm presented with what seems to be a statement of fact, which prompts me to respond in kind.  Also, whether it's intended by the person saying it or not, a statement of "this picture is racist" <i>does</i> reflect on the artist.  It absolutely, inescapably does.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there is also the consideration of art in the context of the game.  The purpose of art in the roleplaying game is to evoke a certain feel that either presents some aspect of the game, or reinforces some aspect presented elsewhere.  Working with the Asian example, if a game is to incorporate Japanese cultural elements, it almost <i>must</i> have pictures depicting kimono-clad women and men bearing katana and wakizashi and such, because these are the commonly recognized features of what the game is attempting to incorporate.  Is the fact that cultures have a set of "commonly recognized features" at all at best highly stereotypical?  Yes.  Is it something that is highly useful, perhaps even necessary, to art in getting its message across?  I believe so.  By the same token, are there lines that shouldn't be crossed?  Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I said a little earlier that my gut reaction to Chris' statement was "only a little."  However, I'm more than willing to look at Chris' statement and take it in the spirit of "these are the feelings engendered in me by this picture," as it is likely meant.  To <i>that</i> statement, I have the much more favorable and useful reaction of "I accept and acknowledge that you feel these things, and I can certainly see where you're coming from."  Now, if I were the artist in question, and weren't predisposed favorably towards Chris by his excellent blog, my gut reaction to his statement as it stood would probably be more along the lines of "Man, fuck you."  Because as I said earlier, saying that a piece of art is racist <i>is</i> saying something about the artist, whether that's intended or not.  And reactions like that obviously do nothing to further the discourse.  If I, as the artist, were instead to receive a comment that was more clearly perceptive in nature, I'd be far more ready to accept the offended person's feelings and try to meet them in honest, open discourse about the nature of the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I feel pretty strongly that onus of presenting such statements as being matters of perception, rather than fact, and not being dismissive of others' opinions and feelings, rests pretty strongly on all parties, not any one in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, all that having been said, there are cases of art that are so obviously racist that it is not at all a matter of perception.  World War II propaganda is an example of this.  This sort of thing really needs to be confronted head-on, and I don't see much of a need for anyone to be overly polite in challenging such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Please note, Chris, that although I'm using you as an example here, I don't mean to pick on you at all.  Quite the opposite.  I think the issue you raised is a reasonable one, and I wouldn't argue against engaging that particular artist in discourse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59740/#Comment_59740" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T15:16:42+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  3:16PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 3:52PM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fifth_child</cite>Because as I said earlier, saying that a piece of art is racist<em>is</em>saying something about the artist, whether that's intended or not.</blockquote>\nI disagree. Or that is to say, I think it does only in so much as you are saying "This thing you created has some racism in it dude." It does not say that the artist is racist, only that their creation has an effect. If that was their intention or not would determine if they are purposefully making it racist or not, and thus could then turn into a discussion about if they are racist. But as I usually don't care what the artist was trying to do, only what they actually did, I don't care if the artist is racist, not, or a jaberwokky. <br><br>Just saying "this picture has racist tropes in it" says only one thing about the artist: that they made a picture that has racist tropes in it. Sometimes this can even be a good thing. That gets all into the murky area of artistic exposure, which is a good topic, and one that we already covered (especially in JDs posts) in relation to Yellow Peril above. <br><br>Also, while I do agree with much of your post about tone, I think that we can go too far on a lot of these things. If we force people to never make strong statements, we keep people from ever actually saying what they mean. If we say that calling a picture racist is always calling the artist racist, then we make it impossible to talk about the effects of art in the abstract, and must always be questioning the personal ethos of the artist -- which I usually find to be a waste of time. <br><br>I find some irony in this: "there are cases of art that are so obviously racist that it is not at all a matter of perception." Because there are people, believe it or don't, who don't see that art as being racist. And people who see things that you don't see as being racist as being just as racist as those posters. Its just that we have a vast shared cultural perception about the WWII posters that most mainstream folks who've been educated in their culture's power-discourse share, and we don't have that about the other pictures. If you find it not at all a matter of perception is simply a matter of cultural position. Really, where Jeff is standing it may be just that obvious that the picture isn't, and from where Chris is standing just as obvious that it is. <br><br>Finally, I find some irony in the fact that in this thread and threads talking about it several white middle class type folks have told both of the self-identified Asians who were most prominent in this thread that their reactions to it were wrong, out of line, taken too far, or unacceptable. Hell, I did it, so I'm not even talking about everyone else being the badguy. I'm also not saying we're wrong arguing about how we want to talk as a community, I just think we have to watch the line about telling them how to talk about racism in their own lives. <br><br>After all, "This is not an acceptable way to talk about how racism directed against you makes you feel" is really close onto a privilege issue, don'tcha think?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59766/#Comment_59766" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T16:11:03+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  4:11PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Brand%20Robin">Brand Robin</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Also, while I do agree with much of your post about tone, I think that we can go too far on a lot of these things.

That's why I said that I was able to take Chris' statement in the spirit that it was most likely meant in, after taking a step back from my gut reaction for a moment.  Call it charitable reading, if you will.  Now, I think it's technically possible to express your feelings strongly in a way that's still perceptive in nature.  Like, if someone said of a piece of my work "this brings out these feelings in me, to the extent that I feel physically ill," well that's a pretty strong statement, and I'd be inclined to take it pretty seriously.  But human communication (and especially communication on the internet) is about as far from a perfect ideal as you can get.

Sorry I am coming in so late but here is my 2 cents...<br><br>Disclaimers: <br>- I am NOT saying racism does not exists.  I know it does and I have a pretty good handle on what it looks/sounds/feels like.<br><br/>- I am NOT saying we shouldn't talk about it and explore our opinions.  We should and this thread, in genreral, rocks.<br/><br/>- I am NOT condoning any individuals actions nor am I condemning them.  This post is completely generalist.<br/><br/><i>No doubt I will have to edit in some other dislaimers as we go but here it is...</i><br/><br/>I think much of our hobby is immune to racist ideologies unless approached with the most specific of strokes.  Most of the art/content that we see that utilizes other races is usually is exploring other cultures in a harmless and more positive means than not.  Only if you see that an artist focuses on a particular race in a particular vein would I consider their art "racist."  If all the characters with African-American features in game X were minstrels - happy, go-lucky, dancing fools - I would probably raise an eyebrow and seriously consider whether I bought that book.  But games like L5R and Nyambe are games that look into what it's like to be a member of that race far more than it is to marginalize them in any way.  <br/><br/>In most games there is conflict and often the most interesting conflict comes from villains.  Villains have to from some culture.  Just because you make a villain of a particular race does not mean you have some deep seated feelings about that race.  Heck, most times I want my villains to be something more interesting to me that some white guy and thus their placement as a villain is actually a vaulted position.  I use Roland Gif in many of my games because I think he has interesting features - as does Ving Rhames, F. Murray Abraham, Adrian Brody and Claudia Black.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, racism in America is alive and well but it's been my experience that much of the open conflict has moved into class struggles of which some peoples of various ethnicities have found themselves inheriting poverty from centuries of marginalization.    Thank goodness it's not tolerated by society at large.  It's more subtle and insidious now and I applaud those that have warned against it here.  I do, however, raise a word of caution that it can go too far and there are probably more critical areas of our society that should be inspected before worrying about a piece of gamer art.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59801/#Comment_59801" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T19:49:40+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  7:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh? <i>Of course</i> a piece of art should result in a discussion about racism.

Sometimes that pushing results in unintended interpretations of the art at issue, some legit, some not.  In my writer's group, I recently received a critique that tried to put me on the couch by speculating what kind of personal fantasy I must have been fulfilling via my story.  Total bullshit.  Obviously there are cases where someone may intentionally use "X-ist" imagery, but as a matter of principle, I try to give the artist the benefit of the doubt on whether a given representation is intended, and then if it is, try to proceed on the basis that the intent isn't per se racist.<br/><br/>Much of our culture is permeated by what has been termed "passive racism,"  that is to say, unconscious behaviors that reflect identification of non-whites as "other."  The prime example is when one takes a seat at the library with an extra table between oneself and the table where the black students are sitting.  Or in literature, when one writes in a supporting character--with the best of progressive intentions--who fulfills the function of the "magical Negro."  Positive representation, but ultimately the race is presented in a token fashion, with no more actual importance to the story than the color of the character's shoes.<br/><br/>Interesting stuff, all.<br/><br/>Tactically, when disagreements arise, my suggestions (take 'em for what they're worth--YMMV) might be to restate what we think we've read or heard, and then ask questions to check the validity of that perception.  Permit the other person the benefit of the doubt if he or she hasn't used exactly the language we think should be used.  Find common ground.  Acknowledge one's own flaws or contribution to any flare ups.  Restate and ask for clarification.  Avoid blanket dismissals or passive-aggressive behavior.  Don't cloak attacks or counter-dismissals in the guise of "you can't handle the truth I'm telling" kinds of rationales.  Avoid the temptation to escalate.  Focus on attacking the logic and the underlying assumptions, not the person.<br/><br/>I'm not saying anyone has engaged in any or all of these behaviors.  As I stated elsewhere, I thought for such a volatile topic, this group has done a remarkable job of self-moderating.  This board is usually so mellow that even little leaf burns like this one might feel like a conflagration.<br/><br/>That's my two cents, adjusted for inflation.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Blake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59939/#Comment_59939" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T11:55:38+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is actually something that I've been dealing with recently, as we're about to release another installment in our PULP VILLAINS supplements for THRILLING TALES:  "Perils of the Orient."<br/><br/>We decided to not use the "Yellow Peril" title, despite that being the universally known moniker for the archetype, simply because it was too racist for our taste.  The supplement itself addresses the inherent racism in the archetype -- but on the other hand, it's a big part of the historical pulps, so ignoring the archetype made no sense either.<br/><br/>In the end, we felt that yes, Fu Manchu can be viewed as a stereotype, but what's important about the character is not the stereotype, but that he's a fiendishly brilliant mastermind.    It is no more racist to feature him than it is racist to do a supplement on the Thugee (which we've done).   We're not saying that "All Indians are Thugee", nor are we saying "All Chinese are Fiendish."<br/><br/>To that end, some boxed text to that effect, similar to what we did with our NAZIS release (where we talked about the fact that we weren't making light of Nazi atrocities, or were in any way glorifying the regime) should suffice.     The folks who will get their knickers in a twist about it aren't our target market.    Our customers recognize the difference between fiction and reality, and understand the historical context of the pulps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59955/#Comment_59955" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T13:03:06+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  1:03PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was hoping you'd turn up, GMS, as your work in the field I consider to be probably the shortest line between the source and the game.

SPOILERS AHOY.<br/><br/>Now as you may or may not know, The Shield is a cop show set in a hellhole neighborhood of Los Angeles starring Michael Chiklis as Detective Vic Mackey, described accurately in the first season as "Al Capone with a badge". He and his team of corrupt cops take bribes from drug dealers and target their competition in return. They frame people, extort people, and in the first season, they murder a police officer who is getting too close. A side note on the Strike Team: in addition to The Shield inspiring a new treatment of race, for those who haven't worked in law enforcement and who don't know a lot of cops, Mackey and his group are a bracing antidote to the authoritarian wet dream that most "bad cops" on TV and in movies are. Typically "bad cops" are portrayed as hamstrung by "the rules" (meaning the Constitution) and are praiseworthy for their brutal treatment of the subhuman criminals (sometimes the inhumanity of the criminals is outright stated, other times it's just implied).  The Strike Team, by contrast, has been shaped by violence and before the first season's over, they've railroaded an innocent person into jail, arranged for several deaths, and it has torn apart families and destroyed their aspirations.  Mackey is the only one confident in what they're doing - and he is presented as the worst of the group to make that decision.  (Indeed, when his son is diagnosed with autism and his wife becomes estranged from him, the kitchen sink drama demonstrates that he doesn't understand that his good intentions mean nothing when placed against the monstrous mountain of bad acts.)<br/><br/>But back to race. The neighborhood is highly diverse, but all poor, so the criminals are white, black, Latino, Asian, all varieties.  The use of music in the series enhances this feeling - you hear Latino hip-hop and local Angeleno acts all the time. The supporting cast are equally diverse - a political kingmaker is Latino, a high-ranking state administrator is black, a respected author and professor is black, and so on. <br/><br/>In the main characters themselves, although there are standout black characters (Claudete, played by CCH Pounder is absolutely brilliantly portrayed, tired, smart, dissatisfied with herself), the second central character to the series is David Aceveda, a politically ambitious police captain in Season 1, a City Councilman by Season 4, and he wants to get Mackey - not in small part because it will cement his political career, but also because he knows Mackey is part of the problem.<br/><br/>What The Shield has done with respect to race is simply depict what a diverse city is.  I suppose I should not say 'simply', after all, so many TV shows have 'simply' not done anything of the sort. Race is a significant issue in many shows but as far as the characters are concerned, it can't possibly be an issue even if they wanted it to be. None of them have the power to change it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend snagging Season 1 on DVD and taking some notes about how they handle race. It has changed my modern-day games. (And historical ones too!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60138/#Comment_60138" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T09:50:53+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  9:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a huge fan of The Shield, and Jason's analysis is spot-on.

Looking at United States history, there's a virtual genocide of native peoples, the importation and enslavement of millions of Africans, a civil war fought largely over issues of race, one hundred years of semi-apartheid, and then a civil rights movement that pretty much transformed American society--organized and championed by minority leaders.  And this doesn't include various wars from Vietnam to Iraq which have disturbingly racist overtones.<br/>\n<br/>\nRace is the great, on-going American conversation.  But matters of race are so raw, so pervasive, and so charged with moral judgment, that it's difficult for people to talk about it openly, even when they have the very best of intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've only lived in Europe for brief periods.  But I suspect Europeans simply have not had to deal with the aftermath of racial imperialism in their daily lives the same way Americans have.  This isn't to say that the European nations don't have a ton of blood on their hands: they do.  But it seems like they aren't forced to deal with it as often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div

archetype, simply because it was too racist for our taste.  The supplement itself addresses the inherent racism in the archetype -- but on the other hand, it's a big part of the historical pulps, so ignoring the archetype made no sense either.<br/><br/>In the end, we felt that yes, Fu Manchu can be viewed as a stereotype, but what's important about the character is not the stereotype, but that he's a fiendishly brilliant mastermind.    It is no more racist to feature him than it is racist to do a supplement on the Thugee (which we've done).   We're not saying that "All Indians are Thugee", nor are we saying "All Chinese are Fiendish."</blockquote>\nYou know, the reassurance of "Well, we're not saying that <i>all</i> Chinese are fiendish" seems rather thin.  Even Sax Rohmer may not have meant that <i>all</i> Chinese are fiendish.  Nevertheless, he was quite serious when he portrayed Fu Manchu as the incarnation of the Yellow Peril, and in his picture that there really was a network of illicit opium dens run by Chinese.  <br/><br/>Other than changing the title and adding a token disclaimer, does your work differ from Rohmer's vision?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><br/>To that end, some boxed text to that effect, similar to what we did with our NAZIS release (where we talked about the fact that we weren't making light of Nazi atrocities, or were in any way glorifying the regime) should suffice.     The folks who will get their knickers in a twist about it aren't our target market.    Our customers recognize the difference between fiction and reality, and understand the historical context of the pulps.</blockquote>\nWhat exactly is the point of the boxed text?

It's not too far off base to describe him as sort of an evil Captain America, an epitomisation of his race (Captain America also draws heavily on racial/cultural stereotypes).<br/><br/>Fu Manchu is the vanguard of the new China, the best and brightest that they have, that in the stories is what makes him such a menace.  He's not an aberration, more a distillation.<br/><br/>In a way they're more racist than I think people sometimes realise.  People mistake Fu Manchu for a mere villain, but in the stories that really isn't how he is portrayed, or at least not in the three Fu Manchu novels I've read so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60390/#Comment_60390" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T14:43:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  2:43PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Other than changing the title and adding a token disclaimer, does your work differ from Rohmer's vision?</blockquote>\nWe cover the usage of the general themes of "exotic oriental threats" -- the brilliant masterminds, the Dacoit stranglers, the Tongs, etc. etc.  as they appeared in the pulps.   Rohmer is a part of that (and actually pre-dates quite a bit of it....none of his work was actually in the pulps, but definitely inspired others), but only a part.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>What exactly is the point of the boxed text?

Guaranteed, if the disclaimer wasn't there, we'd end up having to deal with some ignorant chucklehead who wanted to make a crusade out of our "propogation of racist stereotypes/glorification of Nazis/etc."    It's the same reason why hair driers are labeled "do not use in shower."    Not neccessary, perhaps, but you never know.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>He came pretty close though, the Fu Manchu stories depict a China and a "Chinese race" that is starting to flex its muscles in opposition to the West, Fu Manchu is a forward agent as such, not so much a criminal as an enemy combatant.  It's not too far off base to describe him as sort of an evil Captain America, an epitomisation of his race (Captain America also draws heavily on racial/cultural stereotypes).</blockquote>\nBingo.   I own (and have read) all 14 of Rohmer's Fu Manchu novels.   His depiction of the character is based in Western fear of the "inscrutable Chinese menace" -- and very much a facet of its time -- in the same way that Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> is fairly clearly an anti-foreigner tract, playing up the venerial "they're coming for our women and they bring disease" angle.   <br/><br/>It is our intention (as it was the intention of later authors who featured Fu Manchu) to remove that idea of the "racial vanguard" from the equation, and present him in his other notable guise:  That of one of the first super-villains, along with Moriarity.    After all, nobody says that James Moriarity is proof that the English are all brilliant and without morals!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60395/#Comment_60395" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:17:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I suspect Europeans simply have not had to deal with the aftermath of racial imperialism in their daily lives the same way Americans have.

Here's part of it: prior to the run up to WW II, German Jews were just citizens. That's the story I hear over and over.  That they fought on the German side in WW I, were just German citizens.  So I guess the distinction I want to draw is that you could substitute in "what we did to our own people" in a way that wouldn't exactly parse in the either the Japanese-American or American-Aboriginal sense.<br/><br/>In essence, I think that the concept I'm dragging into the light to examine is that part of the American self-identification is the acceptance of the other - the melting pot and all that.  And the fact that we kick that part of our identity around so much is part of the conflict.  But that's not really part of the European experience, as I (admittedly poorly) understand it.  Not to say that Europeans are bigoted xenophobes, but that inclusiveness is a good idea, not a part of a cultural identity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60669/#Comment_60669" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T14:53:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  2:53PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you mean, Judson, a European analogue of something that wasn't explicit genocide but still makes them weep? o.O                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60672/#Comment_60672" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T15:18:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  3:18PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>And in honest curiosity, can anyone cite a European analogue to the acquaintance of mine who can't discuss the Japanese resettlement camps without weeping?

Like, I'm all on board here with the idea that Europeans and Americans have very different experiences of racism, but anti-semitism has been a pretty common European pastime for centuries now.

Here's part of it: prior to the run up to WW II, German Jews were just citizens. That's the story I hear over and over.  That they fought on the German side in WW I, were just German citizens.  So I guess the distinction I want to draw is that you could substitute in "what we did to our own people" in a way that wouldn't exactly parse in the either the Japanese-American or American-Aboriginal sense.<br/><br/>In essence, I think that the concept I'm dragging into the light to examine is that part of the American self-identification is the acceptance of the other - the melting pot and all that.  And the fact that we kick that part of our identity around so much is part of the conflict.  But that's not really part of the European experience, as I (admittedly poorly) understand it.  Not to say that Europeans are bigoted xenophobes, but that inclusiveness is a good idea, not a part of a cultural identity.</blockquote>\nThe problem with American self-identification with the cultural acceptance and melting pot ideals is that we've been, historically speaking, rather hypocritical about it.  We don't <i>really</i> accept new cultural identities - we force other people to adopt our cultural identity.  We don't have a melting pot in the sense of "all these different ingredients mixing together but keeping their unique flavor," but rather in the sense of "all these ingredients mixing together and creating a homogeneous mish-mash."  Look at each new wave of immigration in American history: Chinese being effectively forced to work mining the gold for Fort Knox, the political rallies damning the Irish, and pretty much everybody being worked near-to-death on the railroads.  We haven't even reserved our xenophobic bigotry for non-whites, like good upstanding racists do.  I'd like to think that we're starting to try to correct these things, but these ideals are not what America has "always been about" in fact, even though we spent a lot of breath on talking about them.<br/><br/>To sum up, the "what we did to our own people" thing may not have parsed to the 1940's Japanese-American population (who by and large weren't culturally assimilated at the time), but it damn well should have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60688/#Comment_60688" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T17:06:18+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  5:06PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fifth_child</cite>The problem with American self-identification with the cultural acceptance and melting pot ideals is that we've been, historically speaking, rather hypocritical about it.</blockquote>\nWhich is what I'm trying to get at.

For instance, the very real problem faced with the South in which they could not figure out a way to free the slaves and maintain a functioning economy.  To a lot of people (especially Washington and Jefferson), freeing the slaves meant everybody starved five years later.  Which was a big problem -- but it barely gets mentioned.  Instead, we make students memorize the phrase "peculiar institution" as if that had any relevance.<br/><br/>There's a couple reasons: (a) slavery and indian genocides took place hundreds of years before the holocaust, and there's just a more historical record for the holocaust, (b) we don't have to deal with "slavery deniers" and there are few "indian genocide deniers" whereas any curriculum on the holocaust has to overcome holocaust deniers -- and do so with an overwhelming amount of factual data, (c) the general state of american textbooks being ass produced by people too clueless or fearful to actually put real data into them.<br/><br/>When she taught, my mom ran weeks-long classroom simulations of slavery and westward expansion (with a healthy dose of genocide), but she had to go way out of mainstream textbooks to find materials to support those simulations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60850/#Comment_60850" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T12:04:26+00:00" title="March 13, 2007 12:04PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Huh, wierd.

The Old Man of Europe has been more like the Creepy Uncle of Europe for a long time now.  But if you want, say, some airbases with overflights of the Middle East, you kind of have to turn a blind eye, and ignore the brutal imperialism of last century.  So that, of course, you can engage in brutal imperialism in this century.<br/><br/>I think what galls me so much is that while denial of American misdeeds is an aberration (even if their treatment is simplistic or lax) we'll arrange to gag our school systems to make a foreign power happy.  Granted: the coordinated effort to suppress teaching the Armenian genocide is a fact that I have on the authority of a slightly paranoid ethnic Armenian, so it might be biased.  If there's another reason, I'd love to be able to say "well, that's all right then."  It'd have to overcome the fact that the Armenian genocide was what made Hitler think he could get away with the Holocaust.<br/><br/>And while I'm requesting debunk of my apocryphal understandings, would anyone care to comment on the Japanese lack of coverage of the Rape of Nanking?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Note, from a textbook editor's perspective, US textbooks "address" these issues in that they mention them, but they shy away from providing concrete facts and figures or explore the relationships and concepts behind the issues.

Each table in the classroom was a different colony on Mars who had all collectively just seceded from Earth.  They had to interact in order to prosper, stay alive, and earn points, but all of their interaction was governed by a really cumbersome consensus mechanic (ie, the Articles).  The goal of the simulation was to prod the students to throw out the Articles-analogue and try to put together a replacement (ie, Constitution).  Which they always invariably did.  To complicate things, there were a lot of little bits including big states versus small states and industry versus agrarian cultures.  One of the big ones was the green-skinned martians that the colonists used for slave labor.  There was nothing in the sim to provoke students to ask about freeing the martians, but they always invariably did.  When ask, the teacher was instructed in the teacher guide to tell them that the martians would riot, fight amongst themselves and raid the colonists, and eventually starve.

And the fact that we kick that part of our identity around so much is part of the conflict.  But that's not really part of the European experience, as I (admittedly poorly) understand it.  Not to say that Europeans are bigoted xenophobes, but that inclusiveness is a good idea, not a part of a cultural identity.</blockquote>\nNot trying to beat the dead horse here, but I think you've got it mostly right. The racism around here tends to be a kind of silent, stonewalling type - we have it and we don't really even consciously know about having it, since we've missed the melting pot -part. The most obnoxious displays of racism (like, openly bigoted and proud about it -people) get a stern and disaproving, if a tad bit understanding, treatment, but most of the everyday -racism goes unnoticed and unthought about. For example, we've had a chocolate candy called (very roughly translated and missing the cultural nuances) "nigger's kiss" for ages which, I presume, would get a lot of people standing at their toes somewhere else. A point was raised about it recently and a lot of people just shrugged and basically wondered about what's the big deal - it's been around for a long time, so what's the point in changing it? And I've been eating <a href="http://merten.kapsi.fi/wp-content/lakritsipatukka.jpg" rel="nofollow">these liquorice bars</a> since I was a kid. Not to mention about the oriental moustache for Jabba. Count on us for not noticing.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's similar in Southern Europe which has had more exposure for other cultures, and for a longer time. I wouldn't bet on it, since a lot of the exposure has been through immigration from formerly-European-owned countries and/or cheap labour force.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2579/racism-in-artwork-and-other-stuff/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2579/racism-in-artwork-and-other-stuff">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2579/racism-in-artwork-and-other-stuff/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2579/racism-in-artwork-and-other-stuff/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2579/racism-in-artwork-and-other-stuff/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2579%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2579%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
