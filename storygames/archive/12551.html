In brief, I'm interested to know which sorts of settings attract you most? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want a familiar setting, close to some sort of fiction you already know and love, so that you can just jump right into it without much explanation?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want an innovative setting, which surprises you, and takes you to a world you've never seen before?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want a generic setting, which leaves as much as possible to your imagination so that you can fill it in with the things you like yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo elaborate a bit, here are some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nFamiliar -- basically lifted straight out of a genre or fictional setting we already know about from movies and literature. This may be a licensed setting we know, such as Dresden Files or Serenity, or it may be just a genre, such as "Western" or "Apocalypse." The most familiar game is of course Dungeons and Dragons, but others might include Spirit of the Century (Pulp), and Fiasco (Coen Bros. movie).<br/>\n<br/>\nInnovative -- something sprung from the mind of the creator which no one has ever seen before. It may be inspired by other settings and stories, but anyone who reads it would all agree it's something quite new. Innovation is somewhat harder to achieve and measure, but examples of Innovative settings might include Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple (Mix of Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Little Prince, and Buddhism) and Freemarket (Post-human Reputation-trading Social maneuvering in Space, or something like that...).<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneric -- tries to steer away from specifics in the setting as much as possible. There may even be no setting at all released with the game, with creating the setting as much a part of the game as playing the characters within it. Fate and Gurps are both classic generic games.<br/>\n<br/>\nA game might be a combination of these. Apocalypse World, for instance, is Familiar (in that it's a post-apocalyptic setting) and Generic (in that it leaves a lot of details for you to fill in). Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies, on the other hand, is Familiar (Three Musketeers), and yet Innovative too (floating continents in the Sky plus tons of detail). Lady Blackbird is an example of a setting that is Innovative (steampunk in an endless sky) and Generic (once again leaves details for you to fill in).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich sorts of settings do you think help the game to get the most readership and play? Which sorts do you think hinder their broad appeal more than they help?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281856/#Comment_281856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T07:20:49+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  7:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a mixture of familiar and innovative. I want the setting to be familiar enough that it's easy to just jump into it and have general expectations turn out to be true (like, say Zorcerer of Zo being a fairy tale setting), but innovative within that framework (ZoZ has an actual geography and even something of an economy that isn't seen in fairy tales but is somewhat necessary for an RPG). <br/><br/>I would classify D&amp;D as familiar and innovative actually, given that it is its own mix of various fantasy settings, and even originally had some sci-fi thrown in too. <br/><br/>I also like near future hard Sci-Fi, hard sci-fi means the technology is still close enough to what we have to be recognisable, and anyone who's a bit of a tech head can probably make a decision that's appropriate to the setting, but again innovative in that there's some twist. Diaspora is a good example of this, it's also in fact quite generic, which is something that I think happens quite often with hard Sci-Fi, but you'd have Transhuman Space being just familiar and generic, given that unless you mix THS with something else, you really don't have anything to work with.<br/><br/>For the most part, a setting has to be familiar in some aspect, either by fitting into a certain genre that's well understood, or being based off a particular IP. Even JAGS Wonderland which is pretty much all innovative still has some familiar thrown in, and it's set up that the characters don't need to know what's actually going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281859/#Comment_281859" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T07:41:01+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  7:41AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David,<br/><br/>What you're trying to understand is the recipe for player engagement with rich settings. And I think the familiar/innovative/generic structure is effort focusing a lens that isn't going to help you.<br/><br/>Player engagement with setting isn't driven by types of settings. It's driven by what players fantasize about being and doing as characters. A setting, whether familiar, innovative, or generic simply needs to promise and deliver on those fantasies to hook players.<br/><br/>And I can't say I've figured out the recipe, but here's some of my thinking:<br/><br/>No one fantasizes about having to change their identity. Lots of indie RPGs are about having to change in some fundamental way over the course of play. Well, mainstream authors write stories about that all the time, but people don't fantasize about having to make hard choices and abandon core elements of their identity. They fantasize about having inherent traits that are unlocked by events. They fantasize that under other circumstances they'd be awesome. They'd be significant.<br/><br/>Another thing people fantasize about is being "first". In Avatar Jake is the first to go truly native. He's the first to fall in love with a gorgeous alien. And he's the first to tame a specific beast, even among the natives. Players are inspired by the idea of being the first to do something significant.<br/><br/>Certainly there are other widely held types of fantasies. And I haven't come up with much more of a list. But I do think it's the right lens for understanding player engagement with setting.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281862/#Comment_281862" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T08:12:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  8:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you can still talk about fantasies and being first in terms of familiar and innovative. Plenty of people fantasise about being a Wizard like in Harry Potter, but since Harry Potter has already survived the killing curse twice and defeated Voldemort twice, to do anything Harry hasn't done you'd be hitting Dragonball Z Cell and Buu saga storylines. A setting like Nain is innovative in that aspect, it's still familiar in terms of Wizards and Wands, but it's a more traditional fantasy setting, a place far away, with no heroes yet. The players then have the opportunity to do their own thing, be the first and save the world, but without the concern of canon meaning to be the most famous or powerful wizard they have to start getting in battles of absurd proportions.<br/><br/>Narnia would work in a similar way, it's familiar in that most people know at least The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, but anyone who's read The Magician's Nephew knows there are an infinite number of worlds, and you can get into them from Earth. It's easy enough to take regular people and transport them to an entirely new world, but still within the Narnian cosmology - familiar by association, but innovative in that it could be completely new and quite different. <br/><br/>Now you could of course do this with just coming up with something completely new, but if you have to explain the setting, it's not going to be that easy, and a lot of people might just bail out at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281872/#Comment_281872" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T11:17:04+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Do you want an innovative setting, which surprises you, and takes you to a world you've never seen before?<br/></blockquote>\nI prefer this. And I'm constantly complaining about how most people don't want this. Of course, I have no proof to back this up other than the fact that popular things tend to be realistic or within familiar genre conventions, and I tend to like unpopular things. Like roleplaying games.<br/><br/>I prefer the innovative in every medium, though, so it might be just a simple matter of my bias and taste. Why watch the millionth crime scene drama formulaic TV show when I can have Battlestar Galactica Space Opera Awesomeness! Why play just another version of DnD when I can have Reign and actually rule a fantasy kingdom! I like new things.

I would not describe it as having "tons of detail", not by the standards that have usually been applied for RPGs.  What it has is a lot of cool, evocative details that do <b>not</b> hang together to create a coherent setting, but instead force the GM and players to connect the dots to put together a setting that is almost certain to be quite different for each group.  (For instance, what's so important about the ruined tower named Raku Spider on Sha Ka Ruq? I know what it is in the game I'm running, but I have no idea what it is in any other game.) This, I think is one of the strengths of the game, and it makes the player's ability to spend style dice to declare facts about the world that much more powerful, since there isn't much real canon to contradict.  It's a kind and level of setting material that I find myself enjoying a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281937/#Comment_281937" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T14:44:23+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  2:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>I wouldn't comment Familiar/Innovative, but I tend to find that the Generic setup, as described, definitely doesn't do this.<a id="Item_9" name="Item_9"></a></blockquote>\nWhen I create things in a Generic setting, I tend to focus on things that I find interesting and resonant.

What I look for in settings are things that push me to think in a pattern different to how I approach reality. In that way the game forms a sort of commentary on reality, pushing both the character and the player to re-examine things and maybe change. Given the lenses provided here, innovative sort of seems the closest, but it's the exoticness of the cultural outlook, rather than the place itself, that's most important. Actually, having familiar elements within the place can make the commentary effect all the more poignant, so it's a hybrid.<br/><br/>Generic settings really don't do it for me (pet peeve might be a more accurate phrase).

Some people want an awesomeness fantasy, others want "resonance," and at least one person wants an exotic setting that forces him to reexamine his notions of truth and reality. Could you give me more details about what matters to you in a setting? Try to be extra clear, and assume I have no idea what you mean at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, what does "resonance" mean? Does that mean that the setting has something in it you can identify with? Issues and questions that mean something to you in real life, or in the fiction you enjoy most? Could that be another kind of "familiarity," only not connected to genre so much as it is to theme?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul wrote that people fantasize about being awesome, significant, and "first." So how do you determine whether any given power fantasy is actually meaningful for you? Does it have to give you that feeling of success, of overcoming incredible odds? Or does it require not only bad guys but also other good guys to totally surpass in awesomeness?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne kind of awesomeness and "firstness" I'm thinking of is a special balance I see a lot of games trying to achieve, between providing information about the setting and withholding information about it in order to inspire you to fill in something for yourself. As Peter said about Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies, even in a setting where you have lots of details, these details don't answer questions so much as raise them, and make you more and more curious to find out the answers for yourself. Shouldn't a really good setting inspire you with this urge to fill in the blanks, kind of like Mad-libs? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Migo was saying, you might want to play in a world like Harry Potter because you like it and you think it's fun, but it's hard to play in that world because the important characters and events are already filled in; so at first you just try to create a world very much like Harry Potter, but without Harry Potter and the rest of the cast -- a world where you get to fill in those important spaces with your own characters and your own adventures. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then you realize that it's just a carbon copy of Hogwarts with the serial numbers filed off, and you don't have anything new to bring to it other than a simple rehash of the same old story with different details. So then, instead of playing students at a magical school, you decide to play students at a steampunk school for budding inventors! It's the same basic idea, but exchanging magic for weird steampunk technology, and replacing an evil wizard who want to take over the world with an evil scientist who believes he has created a way to rid humanity of weakness, and intends to make everyone in the world into living gears in his "perfect social machine" ... and maybe just innovative enough for people to see something new they can do with it. Is that sort of process for creating a setting successful?<br/>\n<br/>\n...So if it has resonance, maybe even if we say it forms a "commentary on reality," then maybe that means: <br/>\n<br/>\n*it gives you just enough of what you already know, <br/>\n*plus just enough of something new and interesting, <br/>\n*and then leaves just enough to your imagination to make you start filling in the empty spaces automatically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282118/#Comment_282118" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T10:44:52+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 10:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Paul Czege&lt;/cite&gt;Well, mainstream authors write stories about that all the time, but people don't fantasize about having to make hard choices and abandon core elements of their identity.

In the Thomas Covenant books, the Bloodguard swore to protect the Lords, and their vow was so strong that they do not age or sleep.  Do any of them regret that?  What's it like to live a thousand years past the death of everyone you knew, because you swore a vow?  What's it like to consider taking the vow now?  How does it change people to have the strength of a commitment confer immortality?  What about the people who can't make that commitment, even though they want to?  What's it like to know that if you just *wanted* something badly enough, you could live forever in its service?  <br><br>I want things like that in the setting, because I know what it's like to outlive someone, because I know what it's like to sacrifice for a commitment, and I know what it's like to not be able to sacrifice enough to keep a commitment, and those things both matter to me and are not tractable to simple objective answers; the easiest way to approach them is slantwise, through fiction.<br><br/>I only want to play in a Harry Potter-like world if there are interesting questions that deal with wants and needs and motivations and frustrations.  I mean, escapist wish-fulfillment is fun, but at the end of the game, I'm still not a wizard and I still can't cast Avada Kevadra, but if a character had to make a difficult moral choice, that sticks with me.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282126/#Comment_282126" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T10:59:15+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 10:59AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Familiar vs. Innovative vs. Generic...

For example, I recently made a game called <a href="http://www.4shared.com/document/1qFpxbir/Metropole_Luxury_Coffin_01.html" rel="nofollow">Metropole Luxury Coffin</a>. It's set in a coffin hotel in a cyberpunk future. I don't live in a coffin hotel, but coffin hotels are home to many with limited money. In the game characters can work while living at the hotel, but the income provided gives them very little opportunity to improve their lot in life. So, characters must look to other methods to make their lives better. The game even allows for the possibility that the best improvement in life isn't a financial one, but a social one.<br/><br/>I'm not that poor, but my money situation is sort of stuck. I have a stable job and home, but can't afford a car or other major expense that might allow me to improve my lot in life. The setting of the game highlights this problem by exaggerating it. What to do? I'm not sure, so I enjoy playing a game exploring that.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, I don't always see these parallels right away when I create or fall in love with a game's setting. Sometimes it takes some play before what I really like about it comes out. Just the same, I can't always clearly pinpoint what I'm struggling with in life, and playing a game with a setting that catches my interest sometimes brings clarity to that. It's sort of like playing <a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock: Social Science Fiction</a>, but without the assumption that I explicitly know what I want the game to be about, and also not having to improvise every detail.<br/><br/>I don't like build-your-own setting games in part because I find improvised play leads to very superficial exploration of topics like these. Sure, there are "<i>aha!</i>" moments, but they often don't seem to build the sort of complex systems that I feel are behind many problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283317/#Comment_283317" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T11:22:52+00:00" title="July 28, 2010 11:22AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm probably in the minority here because lord knows Vampire is really successful, but nothing makes my eyes glaze over faster than a big pile of exposition about the political structure of different factions with their own made up names.  And when I play one of these games it's like I'm expected to learn this stuff.  I couldn't care less about your different kingdoms and their names and what kind of people and governments they have.

When I was younger, I yearned for very in depth settings with lots of details.  I wanted innovative settings (lots of new material that was unique to the gamebook, read non-franchise) within a familiar genre.  This resulted in the purchase of lots of supplement books, which I read like travel guides and then never used in play.  That much detail can't be related to others and can only barely be discussed, even by people who have read the same material.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese days I tend to want a game with interesting mechanics and a definite feel, coupled with a detachable setting made of hooks.   Don't get me wrong - I won't buy a game that doesn't have a setting; however, I'd like the rest of the game to make sense if I wanted to scrap the published setting and paste on another setting with the same feel.  I think Don't Rest Your Head does a great job of having a setting made of hooks without getting into too much detail.  Games like Houses of the Blooded and Dogs in the Vineyard do a great job of capturing a feel yet giving you a setting that you could replace with a similar feeling setting (e.g. Harvard Faculty of the Blooded, CIA Dogs in Afghanistan, etc)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
