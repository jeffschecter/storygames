Aunt Margaret doesn't have much time left.<br/><br/>In the car:<br/>Pauline (daniel wood), her fairly distant but "perfect" niece<br/>Adam (matthew), the talkative and passionate first year artist, Pauline's younger brother<br/>Margaret (jackson tegu), who was the dying Margaret's namesake, and is Pauline's friend, and has some anger issues<br/>Tom (me), who is Margaret's boyfriend (but he's uncertain if he'll stay with her for long), and never knew Aunt Margaret<br/><br/>Even though Aunt Margaret is only Pauline and Adam's aunt, I'll refer to her as that constantly to not confuse with other Margaret.<br/><br/><br/>So, we're driving along on the second day of the trip. Margaret wants to leave school.<br/><br/>Pauline: But... you've only got three weeks left, you're so close to getting your degree.<br/>Margaret: Yeah, I know... but it just seems like there's something that I'm not doing with my life right now...<br/>Tom: Hey, didn't [Aunt] Margaret quit school just before graduation too? Just... turned down her degree?<br/>Adam: That was different.<br/>Pauline: Anyways, Aunt Margaret would want you to graduate. At least do it for her.<br/>Tom: Hey! No, that's what I'm saying. Maybe she wouldn't.<br/><i>And then at that point Adam goes off on me. He talks about how it was different, that Aunt Margaret got knocked up and had to get an abortion, and that she never was satisfied with the fact that she failed to finish her degree. But that life just came up and swallowed the opportunity at that point. he ends with something along the lines of...</i><br/>Adam: ...I'm sure a lot of people assumed. She told us kids, but it's not like she announced it to the town.<br/>Pauline: <b>She... never told me.</b><br/><br/>And it's that last line that I want to talk about. Daniel said it with such a forlorn expression. Matthew had been talking at such a volume and with such speed, opening up and confiding some serious shit about Aunt Margaret to Tom. And Daniel cuts the tail end of that with this really quiet, sad line that just highlights and introduces us to how we all grieve differently and for different things.<br/><br/>And Daniel does forlorn, offhand comments REALLY, REALLY well in games. It was brilliant because I was playing the unconnected boyfriend of another character, and this was the moment where I was let in "to the club", and suddenly Daniel both highlights that and undercuts it with a powerful demonstration of the fact that <i>there is no "club"</i>. Nobody's in the loop.<br/><br/>Nobody really knows who we're travelling to Aberdeen to see. I mean, not really.<br/><br/>And at that point, Pauline goes on to berate Adam for exposing all of Aunt Margaret's secrets to this absolute stranger that he doesn't even like. The scene kept on being great, but it was already MADE for me at that point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
