Do the setup from<i> In a Wicked Age</i> but then do the play of <i>Archipelago</i>. In a way, it's like rolling your own <i>Love in the Time of Seid</i> - the best interest creation from IaWA gets you all pointing at each other in interesting ways, and then the play is like Seid. I really love how Matthijs's Archipelago cards help take the story into new places, and I really love how Wicked Age usually creates an untenable situation where all the players know what they want their character to be doing - and has its face-stabby friend-poisoning gods-walk-the-earth ancient-sumerian-or-some-shit setting.<br/><br/>It's not as tight as Seid - so if you haven't played Seid, play that first. But if you've already played Seid once or twice, this is for you.<br/><br/>And, hey you game designer types - where would you take this from here?  Or is it pretty much done as is?  Part of me thinks, 'It needs more.' Another part thinks, 'Less <i>is </i>more.'<br/><br/>My notes on playing: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-s0pzd2ECeohysfpEJDhU38JUfSlCJEriBfH5jV9Y4/edit" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-s0pzd2ECeohysfpEJDhU38JUfSlCJEriBfH5jV9Y4/edit</a><br/><br/>Some AP:<br/><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/21262602" rel="nofollow">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/21262602</a><br/><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/21471592" rel="nofollow">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/21471592</a><br/><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/22385252/0/#71873352" rel="nofollow">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/22385252/0/#71873352</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373028/#Comment_373028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T00:45:18+00:00" title="April 16, 2012 12:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

We had a real Hamlet ending where all but one of the player characters died - that's really hard to do with IaWA, where you typically need 2-3 whole conflicts to whittle a single character down to 0, but with Archipelago it's as simple as "I strike you down!" "That might not be so easy!" "Yes, and!" So I'm really liking that.<br/><br/>We tried doing two chapters - because that's a really good thing to do with Wicked Age. With Wicked Archipelago, it felt more like telling two separate stories that were only barely connected. Since Wicked Archipelago doesn't have the owe list and there's no way to spam your particular strength or your best stat, there's a lot less need for a second chapter to make the owe list kick in.<br/><br/>The game goes a bit too quick for me, though - you can be done in two hours. It would be nice if there was some kind of tilt mechanism like Fiasco has, to complicate things in the middle. Maybe require the drawing of a Fate card after you've gone around for one round, or draw another Oracle, or something.
