Sell me on football.<br/><br/>Like many gamers I know, I don't care that much about football. I couldn't tell you who the big players are. I know who made it to the Superbowl, and I know the Steelers beat my local Ravens out of the chance, but that's about it. <br/><br/>I'm not totally ignorant about it, though. I watch a few games a year, and I'll watch the 'bowl today. I have played fairly rough tackle football with friends and no padding. I even wrote an RPG called Hellball, where a fictional pro football team has to go to Hell and play a "rules free" game of football against the minions of the Devil to save their Coach.<br/><br/>I suspect there are great lessons for role-players to learn by watching football and thought it'd be cool to discuss them. Why should my gaming group put the dice bags down and watch the Cardinals and Steelers meet on the gridiron today? It sure ain't for Journey or the Boss.<br/><br/>And yeah, commercials. Some of them are cool. Moving on. Talk about football.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190778/#Comment_190778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T11:03:57+00:00" title="February  1, 2009 11:03AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My review of "Watching Football"<br/><br/>At first I couldn't quite see the point of Watching Football. Although the production values are quite high, with lots of 3D titles, animation, and energy, the game itself felt quite passive and uninteresting. But like many games, to really appreciate it, you need to be introduced to it by people who already know how to play. There's a culture of play around Watching Football that, while not contained in any rulebook or supplement I've been able to find, is much more satisfying than the game itself.<br/><br/>In Watching Football, the participant apparently has little input on the outcome of the game. At first glance, this was a negative, but in play I found it to be somewhat freeing. The play of events is interesting in itself and has a lot of subtleties that I missed at first. It took a friend who pointed out the deeper patterns to really get me interested. I suspect there's even more there to find, and that continued play will yield more.<br/><br/>But what Watching Football is really about is the shared social passtime with friends. The game actively encourages this through varied pacing and the inclusion of "commercials" which act as limited breaks where you can rest, talk about play, or even freely socialize. This is one game where digressions don't negatively impact the play experience, and I like that.<br/><br/>Watching Football isn't my favorite game, but it's one I'd try again. Unfortunately, it requires some specialized equipment (a "television set") that I don't have, so I'll have to do it at a friend's house. I'm also a little intimidated by the wealth of supplementary material and merchandise (all of it admittedly not necessary for the core experience). This game is recommended for people who enjoy tactical analysis punctuated by periods of intense action, or for people whose existing social group already play Watching Football, and who would like to join in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190783/#Comment_190783" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T13:12:17+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  1:12PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2009 1:14PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll sell you this, someday.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/gridiron.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190786/#Comment_190786" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T13:51:51+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  1:51PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks fun, Jonathan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190788/#Comment_190788" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T14:06:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  2:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you watch the TV series "Friday Night Lights"?

There's lots of downtime, but every now and then, the chance for a great play comes up, everyone jumps to their feet, it's all on the line--and then it works out or it doesn't.  It's quite the opposite of the excitement curve of basketball, for example, which is much more steady, with much less difference between valleys and peaks (except for the occasional <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBvmYRFU51E" rel="nofollow">freak peak</a>).<br/><br/>But in order to enjoy it much, you've got to care about the outcome, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190790/#Comment_190790" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T14:29:12+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  2:29PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like something a game design can use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190794/#Comment_190794" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T15:13:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  3:13PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gamers that don't like football?

I don't care enough about sports to get the special sports cable channels (I watch television hardly at all, actually), but I have this strange curiousity about exotic sports, so I watch American football and other curiosities when the opportunity presents itself. In this context I find American football quite entertaining, actually - I don't know anything about it, but it seems more strategic and game-like than most sports, and as it's different from the usual fare of winter sports and track and field we do here in Finland, it has novelty value. Actually, if I could choose what to see sports-wise on the television right now, it'd be a toss-up between American football and perhaps some sort of combat sports. Capoeira would be interesting, I don't think I've seen any televised tournaments of that. Of course modern reality television, especially Japanese, gives a stiff competition to traditional sports television; "Ninja Warrior" has good qualities as well when it comes to entertaining television sports.<br/><br/>As I mention above, American football seems much more game-like to me than most sports. This is probably just a superficial viewpoint, but I find that watching it sort of makes me want to design some sports. The rules of the game are so arbitrary and complex that if you can get people to buy into something like that, why not then other strange games that combine strategy, tactics and sports? Perhaps it's time for somebody to start designing sports that provide enough of game-like qualities to get nerds to go out and play? It should also make better television if sports were complex enough tactically and strategically to have real opening theory and strategic arcs like boardgames do. An interesting challenge, that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190834/#Comment_190834" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T07:37:42+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  7:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm waiting for Gridiron Gods Jonathan!

We're talking about a sport where 6'3"+, 240+ lbs. guys capable of competing favorably against Olympic-class sprinters smash into each other on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Much like chess, football is a game that simulates warfare. And the similarities to chess are deep. While football is, of course, an intensely physical sport, there is a deep strategic accompaniment. Playbooks can be hundreds of plays deep. <br/><br/>It is common to compare the quarterback to a general, but I'm not sure that's really apt. The quarterback tends to lead the team in tactical considerations. But unlike many sports, the coaching staff tend to be integral players <i>during</i> a game. A coach and his staff are much more like an army's general and his flag staff. They develop and adjust strategy as the game progresses and leave it to the quarterback and the defense to execute their plans.<br/><br/>A football lineup is a tactical economy, to paraphrase Michael Lewis from <i>The Blind Side</i>. Everything comes with a price. Move your assets to one place, and you'll be creating a weakness in another. <br/><br/>As a game designer, I think that maybe the most valuable lesson a game like football has to impart is that a relatively short list of limitations (number of players on a team, downs structure, penalties, etc.) can create an incredibly rich strategic and tactical environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190858/#Comment_190858" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T10:28:58+00:00" title="February  2, 2009 10:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love football. Especially today, in the wake of my absolute favorite team anywhere winning in the most exciting Superbowl in memory. I really fucking love football.<br/><br/>I have no idea how to sell anyone on it, especially if they didn't grow up watching the game. My father is more of a baseball fan, and he doesn't particularly follow the NFL, though he is a big sports fan in general.  But, I watched college football with him almost every Saturday growing up -- we watched my beloved Iowa Hawkeyes, who were extraordinary in the 80s. It is one direct reason I attended the University of Iowa later on. I just loved Iowa. Between that and playing on the playground, I learned the rules of the game. It took me several more years to love the complexities of the game.<br/><br/>It is a severe and violent game, one of the primary reasons I love the game without apology. This is especially true in pro football, aka the NFL. My favorite team, The Pittsburgh Steelers, have been known for over three decades as one of the hardest hitting teams in the NFL. There's a term for this -- smashmouth football. It means, basically, you run the ball right at the opponent and smash him in the mouth. Then, on defense, you smash them in the mouth some more. Win by sheer toughness. Not all teams in the NFL do this. The Steelers do. So do the Ravens, and a few others. But, all teams have incredible athletes who can hit hard. (I have little doubt that there is widespread use of steroids or similar enhancement drugs in the league, however. I don't like that much, but it's probably true.) All of my favorite players are smashmouth masters. I love defensive players. My favorite player of all time is a linebacker (a primary tackler), Greg Lloyd. Currently, my favorite active player is Troy Polamalu. He's an extradinary player, versatile, fast and hard-hitting. I also like heavy-duty running backs (rather than agile ones) like Jerome Bettis.<br/><br/>I see lots of comments that people don't understand the game, its strategies and complexities and so on. One of the most common questions or comments I hear is something like "Why do they run the ball right in to the pile of people all the time? Why don't they just go around or something?"<br/><br/>I asked the same thing when I was a kid. And, I don't remember my dad explaining it very well, or even at all. But, I learned the answer. It's part of a larger strategy. It's a game of inches, as the cliche goes. You do things not to get a touchdown in every play (which isn't possible, at least in the NFL -- the opponents are just too fast and too good). Rather, you do things to orchestrate a larger strategy against the pieces of the other team. <br/><br/>MORE!!!!...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190859/#Comment_190859" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T10:29:06+00:00" title="February  2, 2009 10:29AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2009 12:21PM by Matt Snyder.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, when you run the ball right down the gut and get tackled in a couple yards, what's going on? <br/><br/>Well, a number of things. <br/><br/>First, you're hoping for enough yards to make the next down "manageable." You get four downs to go 10 yards. If you do that, you get another set of 4 downs. Well, if you run the ball and pick up 3-4 yards, that means that your second or third down is that much easier. So, that's one thing. Making sure you can get another 1st down by going those 10 yards is VERY important. Especially "3rd down conversions." If you don't make it the 10 yards by 3rd down, you usually have to punt (kick) the ball to the other team to be safe.<br/><br/>Second, you are literally wearing down the defense. Some runners (and their blockers) can do this much better than others. But, it can work. You literally run into the other team so much that they wear down, get tired, even hurt. And, eventually, you blow through them later in the game for 20+ yards. Maybe even a REALLY long touchdown run.<br/><br/>Third, and probably most important, you are trying to "establish the run game." You hear this all the time from TV announcers. It's important. Here's the gist of how it works: Your offense basically has two options: Run or Pass. Therefore, a defense basically has two options: defend against the run or defend against the pass. Well, suppose you start running it right up the gut at the other team. What do they do? They defend against the run. A lot of times, this means they bring those defenders who are usually way back there up closer to the line. It makes it look like running is useless and dogpiled. They help tackle the runner, and make sure he doesn't get far. (The Steelers are really good at this, for example. Yay!) Well, what's the result of that? It means that the defense now knows that you're running. And, if you're doing it pretty well, then they start to creep up closer to the line. It's too risky not too. Guess what? NOW you can pass. Those guys who are way back there (the Secondary -- the back field defenders) my creep up to far, or may be in just the wrong place for the pass coverage. BAM! Big pass play. See? Establish the run and you open yourself up to a much, much more versatile and effective offense that mixes strategies.<br/><br/>Fourth, running has another REALLY important aspect. When you run, even if you don't go very far, the clock keeps running every time. This is really important. It's a primary way to control the intiative of the game. For example, if you are ahead by, say, 14 or more points, you run, run, run. It wears down the clock much more, and the other team's offense gets no time on the field to come back to beat you. If you pass instead, the clock stops every time you drop the pass. (It does keep running if you catch the ball and get tackled, though.)<br/><br/>Whew. <br/><br/>Well, I'm with Per. I'm totally baffled why there seems to be an almost definitional thing in gaming where football is the Other. Yes, there are MANY gamers who love football. That's awesome. I'm one of them. But, there are also many gamers who almost go out of their way to point out that their leisure time stands in contrast to things "like football." Or sports, etc. <br/><br/>For example, I have seen many conversations that go something like this: <br/><br/>"I just don't get sports. Football freaks are just as weird about their hobby as we gamers are -- fantasy football, anyone?!? But WE'RE the weird ones? Whatever."<br/><br/>I have never, ever heard a conversation like this: <br/><br/>"I just don't get crafts. Those quilting mothers hoard their supplies just like we hoard dice -- quilting bees, anyone?!? But WE'RE the weird ones? Whatever."<br/><br/>It's like there's a jocks vs. nerds hold over from high school or something in gamer-dom. All but one of my main gamer buddies growing up were (are) big NFL football fans. We spend half our time talking D&amp;D and the other half NFL.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm with Per again.

"Throw the curveball inside now, to set him up for the sinker inside on the next pitch!"  <br/><br/>My problem with Thinking Along With Football is that the link between decision and outcome is harder to spot.  Okay, we rushed on play <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, and now on play <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, we're going to build off that by faking the rush and then throwing to the tight end up the sideline.  The QB throws it, and a defender comes over and intercepts it.  All you'll see on the screen and hear from the announcers is about the quality of the individual athletic performances involved.  Look how hard the QB throws!  Look how fast the defender runs!  Look how slowly the tight end changes direction!  I never find out whether the defense was setting up for this play, or whether they were at least looking for it as a possibility and thus were quick to react, or whether the previous rush had any effect on that.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure if you've watched a lot of football you can make guesses about who was thinking what and what decisions were made and how they impacted the outcome.  Was that defender following a plan, being smart, or simply lucky or a superb athlete?  With enough surrounding info, maybe you can feel pretty confident in your guess.  But man, if I was designing this game, I'd want to see the play calls.<br/><br/>Thank goodness the designers of Thinking Along With Baseball put a camera on the catcher so you can see him call for pitches.<br/><br/>That said, baseball's color (occasional vicious line drive! occasional nasty curveball! occasional diving catch!) is less reliable than football's (constant collisions!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190883/#Comment_190883" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T12:37:48+00:00" title="February  2, 2009 12:37PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Picking up on Thor's mention of Lewis' <i>The Blind Side</i>, one really cool part of football is that it presents economies which trade incommensurable resources at every level - tactical, strategic, and operational.  <br/><br/>Tactical decisions in football are executed so frequently and so fast that they're often hard to make out.  Does the quarterback choose to throw to the nearby receiver, for a high probability of a small gain, or does he try to evade the pass rush for another second so that his downfield receiver can separate from coverage for the big gain?  That pass rush could catch up with him, maybe injuring him out of the game!  Does the running back dive into the pile for a one-yard gain, or try to keep running toward the sideline, looking for another hole?  Does the safety stay in tight coverage on his assigned man, or does he try to get in position to intercept the pass he sees coming?  Does the pass-rushing linebacker see that the running back has the ball by the time he gets into the backfield, and give chase quickly enough to make a difference?<br/><br/>Strategy is the most visible decision level during a game.  The play is over - does the coaching staff substitute a fresh, lesser receiver from the bench for the star who ran downfield and was winded?  If they do, the defense can commit less coverage to his portion of the field... but the coaches could be double-bluffing.  Maybe there's a play in the book specifically designed for this who-dat receiver, something he's practiced so much that just for this one play, he'll look like a superstar \u2014 this kind of wide receiver diversity really is an important factor for certain teams.  Or maybe he's involved in misdirection, creating a low-defensive-pressure zone for a tailback to run a screen pass into.  Later, seeing that you've put four wide receivers into the game, the defense might decide to make a huge tradeoff and remove a run-stopping specialist linebacker - a slower, heavier, harder-hitting guy - while putting in a nickel back, normally a speedier pass-defense specialist.  They might even put in two such players, committing nearly every resource they can muster to stopping the pass, at a serious cost to their ability to defend the run.<br/><br/>Finally, operational decisions are what keep teams viable from week to week.  Each NFL team has a certain budget that they can spend each year to pay their players, and so each year certain players become unretainable as their salaries increase.  How do you allocate your player pay dollars?  Maybe you hire a second-tier quarterback, spend a little more than usual on an offensive line to keep him afloat, and splurge on your running backs as the engine of your offense (the Steelers of a few years ago, back when Kordell "Slash" Stewart was the QB, are an example).  Maybe you say "screw offense" and pay a great deal of money to assemble a really fearsome defense, hoping that your low-scoring offense will be offset by lower-scoring opponents (the Bears, for instance).  Maybe you hire the most reliable QB money can buy, keep him rolling in the league's best wide receivers, and don't worry too much about paying for a league-leading defense, like the Cardinals did this year.  Or maybe you sign "washed-up" veterans to short contracts for surprisingly little money, and extract one or two more career-best years from them with intelligent use of their finely-developed game sense (the Patriots are famously effective at this, and the Raiders infamously ineffective).  If you can create, with innovative game plans, a whole new way to run a team, then you can find "underpriced" players that will be stars in your system but no one else wants (the Dolphins this year with their weird RBs, the Broncos every year with their magical RB Helm of +400 Yards/Season, the Walsh-era 49ers with their weak-armed QBs and disciplined WRs, the 90s Buccaneer defense).<br/><br/>So, tldr: Football is a great game because of player (including GM) authorship at every level.  It has a hugely rich SIS, and a long, entertaining history of AP reports from which you can get all kinds of cool ideas.  Also, violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190885/#Comment_190885" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T12:44:39+00:00" title="February  2, 2009 12:44PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "There was some jawing at the line, but I didn't see the conflict getting resolved there, so I Escalated to Football and got our 30d6 worth of Body.  I got 8 1's, though, and the Defense had 8 6's, so there was going to be a lot of fallout.
