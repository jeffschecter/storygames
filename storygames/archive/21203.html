Ideas and interaction don't need to be a transaction, you can treat it all with generousity rules: the more you give, the greater you are, and you want to be great, because why waste your one life on being petty. I don't begrudge others the opportunity to run with some stray idea, they are a naturally occurring resource. The more I create, the more they flow, and I believe this to be the case for everybody: practice the creativity, and you'll find that you never run out. Trying to commoditize ideas (as opposed to development and productization - those are real work) seems like trying to commoditize love.<br/><br/>Just my take on license jealousy, that.<br/><br/>Regarding the topic, Rob: What do you envision this subscene's deal to be regarding rule zero? I ask, because "valuing design" and "GMs hack extensively" could be read as contradictory, if the latter means "GM changes whatever rules they feel like for whatever reason".<br/><br/>If we're still talking about robustly designed games played in a disciplined way (as in, following the rules, even if they've been changed locally), then the hacking culture doesn't seem that far-fetched to me. I mean, I do it myself all the time to all sorts of games. I haven't felt that games prevent it in any particular way. Maybe we already have the hacking scene you envision?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464607/#Comment_464607" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-04T21:58:01+00:00" title="July  4, 2017  9:58PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You pine, "I wanted to have access to a subscene that assumed GMs will hack extensively, and set up their licences and materials to make that easy, but that also valued design in the way the post-Forge scene does."

I ask, because "valuing design" and "GMs hack extensively" could be read as contradictory, if the latter means "GM changes whatever rules they feel like for whatever reason"."</blockquote>\nIdeally? It would be very dubious about Rule Zero, in a strong contrast to the OSR. It would expect GMs to do a lot of rules changes between sessions, and assume that was inevitable, but to follow rules within sessions. That's kind of what I mean by "values design" - it sees the power of rules to coordinate people to mutual benefit.\n<blockquote><b>Jeph</b>\u2014 Isn't that right here? And the whole *World-blogo-tubu-sphere as well? And also some elements of the OSR, I think. </blockquote>\n<br/>Problems with the OSR \u2014 often reject the idea that "good game design can lead to better games, and in particular to different games" - they favour Rule Zero and "Rulings, not Rules". They also often use the OGL out of necessity, and that's an ugly licence (if nothing else, its complicated and obscure - no-one outside tabletop rpgs knows it at all).<br/> <br/>The PBtA scene is something I'd overlooked - that's better, in particular that around DW where the text of the main game is CC-BY.\n<blockquote><b>Sandra </b>\u2014 "But, what I\u2019m after and what I think Rob is after is a view of games as if they were software libraries / API:s rather than finished apps."</blockquote>\nYes, that's a good metaphor.\n<blockquote><br/><b>Eero </b>\u2014 "Is the legal license thing really that big a deal in this regard?"</blockquote>\nMaybe:<br/><br/>1. As Sandra says, we need precise text, not just ideas. Sometimes the ideal change is just one line in a table. (Her point about github is good too \u2014 I'd like to be able to fork the repo, change a few key lines, and re-render the book for my table).<br/>2. Trademarks \u2014 I can see why people want them, but its not ideal if I have to tip-toe around creators in order to publish a delta of their work.<br/>3. Statement of social expectation is perhaps as important to me as the licence per se \u2014 I want an expectation that people will be ok with others reusing their work.\n<blockquote><b>Adam </b>\u2014 At one point I thought that this is what OSR might have turned into</blockquote>\nYeah, the OSR is centered around a quite narrow set of assumptions, and expects each GM to adlib a lot of what rules can do. I like a lot of what it produces, but it's not that well aligned with the game-style I want to be playing in.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, I think I have something quite concrete in mind about the format of materials, the mode of design, and the community attitudes around reuse. I suspect that to communicate this I have to make something that exemplifies it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464639/#Comment_464639" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T08:11:29+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  8:11AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2017 8:22AM by 2097.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Rob, great post.

I know that Sandra plays modern D&amp;D, and I can sort of see how programming-like version control could be marginally useful if I was crazy-strict about RAW, played with rabid rules lawyers, and played with a lot of different people all the time and I absolutely had to be able to produce and publish an official-looking alternate game text with my homebrew additions so new players could precisely pinpoint how I've rejiggered light radius and missile combat penalties in my campaign, alongside other rules. Is it like that for you as well, Rob?<br/><br/>I can see how there's not much of anything like Github for rpgs out there, so perhaps the scene is indeed lacking in that regard. I don't think I connect with the visceral need myself, but you guys should try building something for your vision. Where there's two people with similar inclinations, it's practically guaranteed for there to be more as well. If you'll set up a website for a new community that "hacks D&amp;D in a new way" or "archives and version controls PbtA hacks", that'll be the first step to finding the other people who envision rpg texts in the same way you do.<br/><br/>Do I understand correctly that you'd like for many people to congregate around a a singular game, something basically traditional, with plenty of complexity and campaign-specific concerns that justify and encourage hacking? I could see how the community efforts would dilute socially even if we had a bunch of people with similar meta-level ideas, if they all were playing different games. It doesn't matter even if e.g. <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is CC-licensed if there's just one person who wants to write for it, after all, so I imagine you'd want to focus on just a single game to maximize social benefits from having a "scene" in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464644/#Comment_464644" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T12:35:54+00:00" title="July  6, 2017 12:35PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crunch come in two classes, open (lists that can grow and shrink: spell lists, monster lists, move lists, weapon lists, principle list, agenda list, needs/objects/relationships) and closed (mechanics that you only need a fixed number of: one initiative system, one damage system, one time-passing\u2013system etc).<br/><br/>Both of these classes, open and closed, are useful to have in source document form. For example ACKS' system for brewing custom potions I've imported into my CC game. It's a "closed class", just one formula, but it was still useful.<br/><br/>I remember reading the Solar System version of TSoY and thinking wtf? I need to make my own crunch?<br/><br/>And, again, mashing up.

So you could start a project, make your own mixtape connecting rules X, Y and Z, connect that to files with system-agnostic content of monsters, weapons, items, spells, etc and another file with your lore. You could then make your own version of the files you used. If the whole thing could be converted to a single file on another format that would be a dream come true, but since I don't know of anything out there able to handle this it seems like an awful lot of work to program and keep up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464652/#Comment_464652" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T16:17:58+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  4:17PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPG mixtape community <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/>  nice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464654/#Comment_464654" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T18:44:53+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  6:44PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPG Bricolage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464655/#Comment_464655" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T18:59:04+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  6:59PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bricolage has already a couple of other meanings in RPG context                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464657/#Comment_464657" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T19:03:54+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  7:03PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2017 7:04PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not as far as I'm aware!

I want to see if I can explain it in simple terms to see if I'm understanding it correctly; perhaps, if others are also having difficulty understanding it, this might help to make these ideas more clear to them as well. I don't usually GM as I typically play GMless games that aren't very well-known outside of the Story Games forums.  And using their content, even if you directly quote some parts, isn't much of an issue, so I think I had a little bit of trouble conceptualizing what the issue was. As I understand it, a lot of you discussing this topic play D&amp;D and other more popular games, (as well as indie games), and in the popular games it's more difficult to quote the text because of copyrights; that is, unless they have some type of SDR or are published under  Creative Commons or another open publishing situation. You tend to be GM's and like to mix up rules and you would like a resource of these rules that are categorized, and you would like to be able to quote text strait from the games so that it's not a pain to reword everything. Also, if I'm understand correctly, you would like to add to these rules some things that make the process of GMing and "mix-taping" easier. For example, Sandra had mentioned that something like having a list of ready-made keys from Eero's game Solar System would be useful. Hopefully, I'm understanding what you folks are interested in, and hopefully I'm explaining it properly. As a solution\u2014which would only be a place to start\u2014what about using things like SDR's and Creative Commons and other open games' direct text, to begin building a website that would act like a database of sorts. I think if you kept the relevant directly quoted text broken up under the applicable headings and rule sets, you would be able to get up away with a lot more, with the more mainstream popular games, than if you directly quoted the books' text in one place. Usually, if these larger publishers have an issue regarding using specific source material not found a SDR's or direct text quotes or the like, they will send you a cease-and-desist letter, especially if you're a small organization that's nonprofit; I'm not aware of any lawsuits coming up in the RPG world, so <i>based on what I know</i> I think you're pretty safe there. I think the worst that would happen is they send a cease-and-desist letter and you could remove whatever material they asked you to. However, if you're uncomfortable with doing that\u2014it may not  be compatible with your personal values, etc\u2014you could just start with the open stuff, SDR's and the like. As far as, doing this with indie publishers, I think they are typically much more generous and as long as you ask them, most would be very willing to let you folks  directly quote parts of their games.  For example, if you just quoted the relevant text under the specific part of the database that it was relevant to, and didn't publish the whole text of the game in one place, I think that most designers would be comfortable with it.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/>A very long aside: <br/>Sandra, I think I can see more clearly where you were coming from and what your interests are in gaming. I think the reason I didn't precive our conversation as being productive the other day was because I may have misconstrued your intent. I think what contributed to this was that we have different interests, come from  different perspectives, and make different assumptions when it comes to gaming; we were likely thinking we were talking about the same thing when we were talking about very different things. I also, admittedly, sometimes have difficulty understanding your posts; I think we may have a bit of a different communication style. The other day, I felt as though I was being attacked on a number of fronts. For example, I felt as though my contributions to the Story Games forums we're being questioned, and that I was being accused of being a "taker." That my right to discuss my game and its design was being questioned and that it was being said that the discussion wouldn't generate interest or be merited unless I "gave" more on the Story Game forums and published my game under Creative Commons or the like. That I was doing something wrong by not publishing my game under CC or the like. From this thread, I can see that you likely were acting in good-faith and that I was simply misunderstanding where you were coming from. I also think I'm a bit defensive when I feel like my contributions to the indie community are being questioned.  I think my initial impression, feeling as though my contributions being questioned, colored my perception of the rest of the conversation, and I didn't give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you were coming from a place of goodwill, which is almost always the wrong thing to do and was the wrong attitude for me to take. Contributing to this community is important to me. I try to promote indie games as much as possible. I introduce these games to those who are unaware of them at my gaming club, Story Games SLC\u2014many of the members have gone on to purchase a number of these games. I also try my best to contribute monetarily by purchasing indie games\u2014I'm honestly not aware of anyone who has purchase more indie games than myself, and I think others can speak to this. The point being, I took the conversation way too seriously and way too personally and my perspective was skewed because of this. I can see why saying that our conversation was adversarial, and my suggestion to end our conversation and try another day, surprised you and seemed to come out of left field\u2014you were just having a conversation about gaming and it wasn't meant to be as personally directed as it seemed; in essence, your comments weren't intended as a criticism. That said, I wouldn't be being honest or fair to myself\u2014or to you for that matter\u2014if I didn't add that given the personal subject matter of the conversation and the way it was framed, it was reasonable for me feel criticized, and I hope you're willing to consider this. I try very hard to be positive and to build positive relationships and friendships with folks at the Story Game forums and in the indie community at large. I failed in this regard by not assuming good intentions and goodwill on your part. It was counterproductive to contributing positivness and trying to build win-win relationships and friendships. It sometimes takes me a while, and I don't always succeed, but when something goes awry, I do try to look at my contribution to the situation and where I erred. I hope you see these comments as gesture of goodwill and an attempt to trying to extend an olive branch. If this response seems long or a bit overly serious, it is because having combative conversations that lead to negative experiences for others and/or myself, is the last reason I come to these forums. I come to build relationships of goodwill and to improve my designs. I very much value the ability to have discussions and pick the minds of the best designers out there; I truly considered it a privilege and I'm very grateful to be able to have discussions with designers like Jason Morningstar and Ben Robbins.  Nearly every designer here: Paul Taliesin, David Berg, Eero Tuovinen, Rafu, and the list goes on and on, have helped me immensely. I propose that we use this as an opportunity and from here out, we do our best have constructive conversations, and assume the best intentions of one another. Building friendships and being a source of positiveness is always my aim and I will do my best to aim better from here on out <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> Thanks for taking the time to read my essay, haha. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464659/#Comment_464659" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T19:07:04+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  7:07PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overall, though, I agree with Eero, above:<br/><br/>While this would be a really cool project, its needs seem so incredibly specific to a particular sub-community of gamers that it's hard for me to see the urgent need.

There\u2019s so much I lose out on that \u201cnormal people\u201d can just do easily. Where I live, getting prescriptions online is probably the biggest thing.

I love to see communities form and try out new methods of collaboration. Even when they "fail"/stop/fade away, as these things tend to do, there's generally knowledge and experience gained. <br/><br/>2. I'm a huge nerd for open licensing, digital collaboration and various new things that come out of their penumbra. Just the idea of having various rulesets in easy to use and algorithmically consumable formats gives me ideas for weird stuff. (Like, I'd probably be the weirdo who writes something that procedurially tries to produce a Frankengame by picking pieces from various repositories as some artistic experiment.)<br/><br/>3. I'm a huge proponent of the idea that games should come either come in as wide a variety of forms and formats as possible, or <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800014-I-kinda-wish-gaming-pdfs-came-with-pre-layout-txt-versions" rel="nofollow">at least in one format that's easily convertable into other formats.</a> Pdf as the default format has its advantages, but if you want to extraxt the text from it, convert it to an epub or (depending on the design) using it in a screen reader can be a huge pain.<br/>Having more games in something like Markdown would be really nice. <br/><br/>So, yeah, I'd love to see people do something like that. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464678/#Comment_464678" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T01:00:51+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  1:00AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Part of the problem between you and me was that you were also reacting to things where you were the last thing on my mind, where I was talking to other people and you read it as being about you when that wasn\u2019t my intention at all.

Sorry, bear with me a little, it's somewhat convoluted to explain it.<br/><br/>You've probably heard of that archetype become meme that says that americans get offended by everything. In all my years here on SG I have felt as if some people more than others are like this, they get offended by things that in our personal cultures are far from being offensive. I'd put some example here but some people would get offended <img alt=":lol:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":lol:"/> <br/>Ok, one small example, the latest one I can remember: for denominations like elves, dwarves, humans, etc. you can't use the word "race", you must use "species" or come out as a bigot. No middle ground, no consideration that you may come from a culture where the equivalent word, "raza" is a synonym of "species" with no additional connotations. I didn't even thought of Tolkien as racist in that way till I started checking the Forge. <br/><br/>Anyway, I've stepped on so many toes around here with my use of terms that now I've somewhat assimilated the "THAT'S SO OFFENSIVE" stance about things that are just offensive in my own culture and context. Which isn't yours Snadra. That's where I started to misunderstand and ruin things.<br/><br/>What made me started to react in that dismal way I did was that all I saw everyday in SG in most threads were comments from you that I interpreted as offensive to my gameplay. Which yes, you didn't know or actually care of. What I felt about those comments didn't actually mattered in the discussion, but heck if I couldn't help but feel it. And everyday, everywhere, whenever I went checking SG I felt, same as Jeff, judged, and while I resisted the best I could I finally ceded to the urge of trying to make my point come across, that I was <i>feeling things</i>. Which later turned into worse behavior because of frustration of being less and less understood.<br/><br/>So yes, you were talking to other people, about different subjects... all of which I found offensive repeatedly in different occasions. But you didn't know, I didn't tell you that, you had no way of knowing it, you weren't talking to me nor judging me. I went apeshit passive-agressive/nonsensical on you unjustly and I'm really sorry for that. My sincere apologies, Sandra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464682/#Comment_464682" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T06:45:06+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  6:45AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra, WarriorMonk, Jeff_B_Slater \u2014 good to see you reaching mutual understanding, but can you take this to another thread, please?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464683/#Comment_464683" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T07:27:36+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  7:27AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another possible example - it _sounds_ like a group on the DW Discord channel are trying to do this for DW.

I think I might place these higher for community-building than a possible open platform, which I think is a helpful tool but one that we have lots of options for already:<br/><br/>* There are a few great blogs and such out there that really got me started on the idea of the implied setting of OD&amp;D, especially Philotomy's Musings. Some of those things became explicit in later D&amp;Ds (like Elves not having a soul thanks to the specific wording of Raise Dead), others not so much. My embrace of that idea was partly the implied setting already present, but also partly that I wanted a rulebook that would really intentionally create a variant of it.<br/><br/>* I also wanted an instructional text that was specific about how we would conduct ourselves. This is especially important because it's a thing that D&amp;D specifically is normally quite bad at. And I made that text with the same tools as the setting\u2014sometimes there is overlap, as the brief description of the Cleric ends, telling us about the setting but also about who is responsible for what world-building or narrative tasks:\n<blockquote>When a question of the spiritual comes up\u2014the afterlife, fate, the habits of demons, morals\u2014first ask the Cleric.</blockquote>\nTo me this is what the initial proposal suggests\u2014a chance to drill down at the table level into what kind of game you want to make, and to be explicit about it. I certainly think Eero does that, but despite his willingness to share, for him it's differently structured process, a single organism rather than a rhizome, and while his principles and some parts of his framework are certainly useable, they aren't quite a game until you fill them out. It opens some specific doors like Flailsnails (or <a href="http://sstabhmontown.tumblr.com/post/103611664706/characters-from-other-worlds" rel="nofollow">my own largely-compatible variant</a>) since i find the original not up to my standards)\u2014I don't know how I'd adjudicate a character from Eero's game joining mine, we might re-stat them I guess, but I sure know how I manage characters from a friend's Stars Without Number game, or an acquaintance showing up with a Trail of Cthulhu investigator character from a con game who nonetheless went on an adventure with us (and perfectly ended up almost drowning in an underground oracular pool, confronting the local spirits). Or\u2014the way that magic-user players turn up with supplements of spells from other D&amp;Ds every month and pick ones to research.<br/><br/>Anyway I should totally pull out a markdown version of my rulebooks, I have a bad habit of editing the text in indesign.<br/><br/>Edit: lol I tried to format the link in this post with markdown                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464727/#Comment_464727" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T20:19:57+00:00" title="July  8, 2017  8:19PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2017 7:14PM by 2097.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often write my SG posts in markdown and convert them actually <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/>Rob, maybe I'm trapped in spam queue then, or something else?

Or, you want to send patches to other people. Improvements, options etc.</p>\n<h2 id="why-git-instead-of-a-wiki">Why git instead of a wiki?</h2>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each campaign is it\u2019s own world; a wiki is centralized. Perhaps the correct rule for your game is wrong in mine; or, it\u2019s right in both but it\u2019s not at an opportune time to change it in yours. Or any of a hundred different reasons why the decentralized nature is good.</li>\n<li>The centralized nature of wikis is an ill fit for a community. We don\u2019t want a single, central needle\u2019s eye like G+ or The Forge, we want something decentralized like blogs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="skill-barrier">Skill barrier?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First of all, perfect is the enemy of good and a little is better than nothing:\n<ul>\n<li>No git? Just put the files up somewhere and we can use diff and other tools (including git\u2019s own tools)</li>\n<li>No markdown? Just put it in something that pandoc can convert. Or whatever, we\u2019ll find a way.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Making things so that nerds can use them is the first step in making something everyone can use. Geeky programs are the bootstraps we need to pull something together, analogous to how programs like kernels, libraries and compilers are what\u2019s under the hood for more slick user-directed apps. If we can get this going, tools can be built on top of it to make it more accessible.</li>\n<li>Most alternatives to nerd tools are proprietary (Google Docs comes to mind) and/or require expensive, modern computers</li>\n<li>The problem with inventing new protocols is the protocol itself. Cf all the struggling alternatives to Twitter and Facebook, I spent some time in the identi.ca swamps trying to get it to work. By starting with git and some markup language, we get something tried and true and frankly amazing (I\u2019m always impressed by git) and we get something that works <em>today</em>.</li>\n<li>Fifth: we who want this, want it. Those who aren\u2019t stoked about the same paradigm are welcome to wait before jumping onboard, (if they ever even choose to do so).</li>\n<li>Also, one of the points of a markup language is that you can render it out into books, webpages etc, for reading. Getting most of the benefits of the traditional model.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Upstart" rel="nofollow">Upstart</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>RPGs aren\u2019t like software, IMO.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>During the 90:s and slightly earlier, the view of RPGs like a textbook, a novel, or a travel guide became popular. Before, the analogy was board game rules / wargame rules.</p>\n<p>But I think that software is a better analogy. Software for humans. And also\u2026 what we want is <em>more</em> hacking, and more easily accessible hacking. Open source software is the perfect model.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn\u2019t how you <em>introduce</em> someone to an RPG.

Explicit permissive license.<br/><br/>If you write something you want to make easy for other people to use, slap a permissive license on it and make that explicit when publishing it wherever you do.<br/><br/>2. Easily importable/resusable publishing format.<br/><br/>As (1), but additionally to the pdf/website/130 foot mural painted on the side of a bulding somewhere as a publishing venue, you also have a file to download linked that allows to get at your work easily and makes importing it into other work fast and as hassle-free as possible. For text, this probably means a plain text file instead of/in addition to a pdf or website. (For images some losslessly compressed high-DPI format, etc.)<br/><br/>3. Added Markup.<br/><br/>As (2), but additionally the text has markup added to detail layout, seperate text passages from headlines, and so on. This could be Markup (Which is really easy to use.) but it could also be some other kinds, as long as it's somewhat widely used and/or easily converted to whatever markup a potential recipient might need. (The formats <a href="http://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">pandoc</a> understands are probably fine.)<br/><br/>(Roughly ordered by work necessary and value added.)<br/><br/>Work published under a permissive licence and in an easily reusable format would IMO be a great step to do, without ever needing to touch anything like git or Markdown.<br/><br/>And if somebody later-on decides to try their hand at those things, these steps would make it that much easier for themselves. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464851/#Comment_464851" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T10:48:57+00:00" title="July 16, 2017 10:48AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" rel="nofollow">Lord_Minx</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Work published under a permissive licence and in an easily reusable format would IMO be a great step to do, without ever needing to touch anything like git or Markdown.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nYes.

So we have some people using it for old-school dungeon crawling, others for highly emotional story-gaming, there are diceless variants, etc. but they are all speaking this semi-consistent metalanguage of PbtA, which often comes in almost self-contained chunks that can be recombined to new effect.<br/><br/>Also, quite a large part of it (The Dungeon World scene.) is already using open licenses.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464870/#Comment_464870" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-17T08:46:11+00:00" title="July 17, 2017  8:46AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some barebones PbtA could inspire folks.

If anything, there is almost too much hacking going on - it seems sometimes like hardly anyone plays a game "as written".<br/><br/>My impression has been, rather, that people's tendency to stay away from things like SRDs in the "indie" world has been for a different reason:<br/><br/>A strong line of thought which says that "Design Matters".<br/><br/>This implies all kinds of things, but a big one is:<br/><br/>* You can't just arbitrarily change rules within a game. Good game design has focus, and every part which doesn't support its themes should simply be excised.<br/><br/>For example, in theory PbtA games should be able to swap moves and cross-pollinate playbooks and mechanical subsystems. In practice, though, well-designed PbtA games are so carefully put together that just cutting out a move and replacing it with another doesn't "gel" with the rest of the game.<br/><br/>(In fact, I've heard many say that the "heartbreakers" [weak designs] of the PbtA design trend are those who don't hack deeply enough, instead just collecting a few bits here and there and throwing them together. Whether that's true or not, it's definitely an opinion I hear often, and pervades the 'scene'. Instead, people are encouraged to hack "deeply", essentially rebuilding games from the ground up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464887/#Comment_464887" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-18T23:14:18+00:00" title="July 18, 2017 11:14PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2017 11:15PM by Upstart.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people know pretty well what rules they can comfortably use.

I believe Google docs can manage versions, but finding which exact version or document you're looking for is a mess. Trello is great for coordinating collaboration, but in this case we don't need to coordinate too much, actually, everyone can work alone and say "hi, I've got this, plz upload to the repository" when done. Trello can't hold big chunks of information; certainly, you can introduce them as links, but that's not the idea here nor solves the format problem, which writing in Markdown does.<br/><br/>I get that the tools used aren't popular for non-programmers, don't "look" intuitive, but the learning curve isn't as step as it looks.<br/><br/>That said, is there any way that someone could make a thread here in SG to guide people who would like to collaborate and have absolutely no clue about what's Markdown and Github?

Or at least not one thing.<br/><br/>Like, right now, whatever is happening here and in the other thread and maybe in some git repo here and there is just an idea that some random people found funny and/or interesting enough to punch some letters in theor computers. There isn't much to get because, so far, there's no one idea, no coherent movement, no specific project, really.<br/><br/>Now, for me personally, I like the idea of spreading knowledge around, whether it's some kind of open game texts or how to use tools like git, etc. I like it when people publish their games in non-pdf format, because sometimes I like extracting stuff from them and it's incredibly painful most of the time. <br/><br/>So that's why I started the other thread and made that one git repo. As for what other people (want to) get out of "this": You'd have to ask them.<br/><br/>(At least until somebody writes up a manifesto, but those have fallen out of favor in these PoMO times.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" rel="nofollow">Tam_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I would suggest LaTeX, by the way, as a tool for making the markdown attractive.
