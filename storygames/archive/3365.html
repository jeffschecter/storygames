On one side, it's a 'normal' looking business card, but that's actually your character's stats. Even the phone number can be used somehow, I bet!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Highmoon</cite>See, what would be really cool is a game where you can grab any business card and based on what information is presented on the card, you have stats that you can use in play. This would work best, I think, for some sort of "monster duel" type of thing.<br/><br/>Think: my business card has a large logo on the left side, my name and title on the right at the top, and then my contact info below, like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" height="146" ismap="ismap" src="http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e30/highmoon/GamerTraveler/tgt_bc_sm.jpg" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" width="250"/><br/><br/>So myabe I get some particular bonus for the size of the logo and the placement (+2 to left side attacks), the relative size of my name grants another bonus vs. the attacking card's name, and the fact it is a horizontal card means I have a larger area expose front and back but a small flanking area (which would make vertical cards have a distinct difference in combat profile).<br/><br/>The rules, of course, would fit on a business card (man, that's gonna be some tiny font). A game like this at Gen Con or GTS, where business cards are given out by the cartloads, would be awesome. It would also give an incentive to take the business card on the desk/counter next time you go to a doctor's office, retail store or Chinese restaurant.<br/></blockquote>\n<b>"Office-Mon"</b><br/>See - I think the phone number IS your character's stats. Then build in orientation, logo placement, and lines of text as per Daniel's suggestion.<br/><br/>Looking at my business cards - I have three - one for my "real job" and two for side ventures of different sorts. All are arranged 'traditionally', ie., horizontally and are of traditional shape.<br/>One has three lines of text, not counting one 10-digit phone number, one e-mail address, and one URL. The logo takes up a position like that of the Star Field on the U.S. Flag with the text next to it and the contact info below it.<br/>The second is similar, but has two different phone numbers. The logo takes up the full left side.<br/>The third has FOUR lines of text, three phone numbers (one is an 800-hundred number and includes a 5-digit x'tension), one two-line street address, one e-mail address and no URL. The logo takes up the full left side and includes a hole (yes you can see through my card).<br/><br/>To Me: Multiple phone numbers suggest multiple 'forms'. More or less text should be a balance thing - some advantage (more defense/hit points?) at the cost of some disadvantage (slower?) Street address vs. URL suggests some sort of aptitude, the third card feels somehow anti-technology compared to the other two.<br/><br/>As I type this up, I am reminded of "Liar's Poker" played with dollar bills (or some such). I don't remember the specifics, but it involved the serial numbers on currency and what digits may or may not be on them. I wonder if that could be adapted in some way....<br/>I think it's silly, but I find the idea appealing. Anyone else wanna help flesh this out some more? Ideally the full rules should fit in a business card, front and back (roughly 200 words total).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76342/#Comment_76342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T05:26:24+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  5:26AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has continued to bounce around in my head since the original thread - so I am open to helping flesh it out....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76343/#Comment_76343" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T06:02:13+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  6:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know it's not nearly within the 200-word limit and not really a role-playing game, but I created a business card fighting game called <a href="http://www.luchacabra.com/?p=40" rel="nofollow">White Collar Battle</a> about a year ago. The gist of it is that all the numbers, phone number, fax, zip code and even any numbers in the email address or company name, are all incorporated into your character's stats. The phone numbers act as your hit points and your willpower, the zip codes trigger special combos. Heck, I'll just post it here for convenience' sake.\n<blockquote><br/>Each fighter is trying to attack each other simultaneously. If there are more than two fighters, each has to declare who they're attacking. Gather up to ten 10-sided dice. The more dice you have, the more aggressively you're attacking and the more vulnerable you're making yourself.<br/><br/><br/><b>Roll the Bones</b><br/><br/>Roll your dice, check how many dice have matching results and determine the \xe2\u20ac\u0153height,\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153width,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153depth\xe2\u20ac\x9d of these sets. The width of a set is the number of dice that are matching. The height of a set is the digit on the matching dice. The depth of a set is the overall number of dice that were rolled.<br/><br/>For example, if you rolled 6 dice, which resulted in 5 4 8 6 8 8, you would have one matching set, the three 8s. In shorthand, this is written as 3\xc3\u20148, where the first number represents the width of the set (3) and the second number represents the height of the set (8). the depth of the set is 6 because you rolled six dice.<br/><br/><br/><b>Crunch the Numbers</b><br/><br/>You may now draw a slash across any number of digits on your business card. For each digit slashed out this way, that digit is added to your set(s) as if a die had been rolled and come up with that result. A digit may only be slashed twice, forming an X across that digit. Once a digit is X\xe2\u20ac\u2122d, it cannot be slashed again. By \xe2\u20ac\u0153digits,\xe2\u20ac\x9d this refers to ANY digit on your card, not just phone numbers, but addresses, websites, and copyrights as well.<br/><br/>For example, if you rolled 3\xc3\u20148 in the previous example and slashed two 8s on your business card, your set would now be 5\xc3\u20148, as if you had five dice come up with 8s as a result.<br/><br/><br/><b>Resolution</b><br/><br/>It is assumed that both fighters are trying to do as much damage to one another as possible, without leaving themselves open for their opponent to do the same to them. Consequently, the amount of dice you choose to roll is analogous to how aggressive your fighter wishes to be. The downside of aggression is that it leaves you vulnerable to counter-attack. Here is how each roll is resolved:<br/><br/>1. Whoever has the <i>lower</i> depth is resolved first. Two fighters with rolls of the same depth are resolved simultaneously. (This does allow the slim possibility of double-KO\xe2\u20ac\u2122s)<br/><br/>2. Check the height of your roll and find any digits on your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s card that are equal to or lesser than the height.<br/><br/>3. Check the width of you roll. You may draw that many slashes across the digits noted in the previous step. When a digit has two slashes, it cannot be slashed any further.<br/><br/>There is a delicate balance inherent in each roll. In order to perform an effective attack, you must have good sets. To have good sets, you need to roll lots of dice. However, if you roll lots of dice, you leave yourself vulnerable to attack. Choose the number and types of dice you roll wisely.<br/><br/><br/><b>Victory</b><br/><br/>When all your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s digits have had two slashes drawn across them, he is defeated. When a business card has been in several fights, the process of drawing and erasing slashes can sometimes cause physical damage to the card itself. Once a card has been so completely battered that you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t even recognize it, the fighter has retired and gone to live a quiet life with his family. Bastard.<br/><br/><br/><b>Combos</b><br/><br/>The zip code on your business card is a special combo that releases a special attack. When you make a roll, it is inevitable that some dice will not be part of a set. If any of these dice match a digit in the zip code, you may set aside those dice from further rolls. These dice do not count towards subsequent rolls, but they do count against the maximum number of dice you may roll in a single round. (Ten, if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll recall.)<br/><br/>For example, if you had four dice set aside, you could only roll a maximum of six dice. When you have five dice matching the zip code on your business card, you may perform a special attack from the following list. Once you have activated a special attack, the dice return to your pool once more. You may not have more than one combo set growing at one time.<br/><br/>Number Cruncher: Draw a slash on all instances of digits matching your zip code on your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s card. For example, if your zip is 03038, you can slash all 0s, 3s and 8s on your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s card.<br/><br/>Snapping Pencil: Your attack has crippled your opponent. He has lost his ability to roll a number of your choice. In all subsequent rolls, your opponent cannot count results of that number in his sets. For example, if you cripple their 8\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, then they can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t count 8\xe2\u20ac\u2122s.<br/><br/>Collating Claw: On your next roll, before you slash your own digits on your business card, you can swap one dimension for another. That is, swap depth for height, depth for width, width for height, etc.<br/><br/>Hot Coffee Spout: Your opponent is blinded, causing them to flail around helplessly. The depth of each of their rolls is doubled, but does not give them extra dice.</blockquote>\nI dunno if any of that is useful, but I figured you'd like to see "previous research" on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76420/#Comment_76420" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T09:54:15+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  9:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this Daniel.

I may need to pull out my copy of Traveller and peer at them again.<br/><br/>One thing I was pondering yesterday is lack of uniformity.  Here in the United States, all phone numbers are of essentially the same form: (###) ### - ####.  But if you go outside the U.S., the form can vary wildly.  That may be okay, but if we design for a specific (ie., U.S.) structure, we should be explicit in our understanding of that.<br/><br/><br/>The path I ended up wandering down mentally yesterday afternoon was heavily inspired by Daniel's game and followed a bit of a DitV path.  When conflict between two cards is initiated, each Office-Mon chooses a set of numbers - those in their street address (if available) or those in one of their phone numbers.  Whoever attacks first picks two digits out of their set of numbers.  The defender must match the total of those digits with one or more digits from thier own set of numbers.  Then the defender becomes the attacker and the process repeats.  Each digit can only be used once.<br/><br/>If an Office-Mon wants to bring in an additional set of numbers, they must risk a line of text from thier card - either their email address, thier web address, or one of the lines of their title block.  (Text from the logo is not considered text for this purpose.)  They can do this at any time.  If they win the battle, the line of text remains unavailable until the next day.  If they lose the battle, they lose the line permanently and the loser can add an equivalent line to thier own card - next time they get access to a printer.<br/><br/><br/>Just a thought that obviously needs to be fleshed out.
