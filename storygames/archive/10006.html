Even the SG wiki introduction to story games could be a bit intimidating or confusing to newcomers.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about making a companion website for the flyer that would basically include the content of the flyer, recreate the SG wiki in a more friendly and appealing form, and provide resources for playing story games that I didn't have room for, or didn't want to include on the flyer.<br/><br/>I don't want it to be another community or a wiki. I do want to target it toward non-gamers who want to give this weird hobby a shot.<br/><br/>So, story games forumeers, is this worth doing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222032/#Comment_222032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T09:36:13+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  9:36AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the same objections as to a pamphlet.

(This is not a theoretical question, as I expect/hope to be in this situation quite often over the next six months or so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'd love to be able to say, "hey, check out RPG's on the Internet" and be done with it.  But the first hit is RPG.Net where there are a bunch of fiddly little debates about whether a Sexy Vampire can beat up a Feral Vampire, or whether the latest Dungeons &amp; Dragons splat book is slightly broken, moderately broken, totally broken, or insanely broken.  Or there's Wikipedia, where the general introduction is 10 screens long.  Neither are good general introductions; neither empowers the newcomer to get out there and muck about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt'd be nice to have some place to point someone which is super-newbie-friendly, DIY and general in scope.  The only agenda being, "Hey, this is a thing!  We think it's fun.  Here are places to find more info, and some local people to contact."  So far as I know that doesn't exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nShreyas is right that websites are for enthusiasts (or people who are already curious) - but those people do exist and I wonder if they're being served as well as they could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Brennan, I think the flyer hits the right points but, for me, is a bit too wordy.  Like, maybe by 33% too wordy?  "Where did they come from" doesn't matter.  I think "How do you win" is probably unnecessary - if you frame it right in the opening paragraph, it should be obvious that creating a kick-ass story is the big reward.  The key bit of content is the first two sections, and I think I'd word it more like, the rules help us structure a story - horror stories have different pacing and a different kind of logic than romance stories, for example.  And we sometimes use dice or cards to keep the game unpredictable.

That might be even easier to digest than a block of text.<br/><br/>For example, these are some of the videos I've made in the past couple months. I'd never done any video editing before, but that oughtta tell you it doesn't take much more than a camera, some simple video editing software and maybe some open source music.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVSuviern3A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVSuviern3A</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHQlkx72bU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHQlkx72bU</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222119/#Comment_222119" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T19:00:18+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  7:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Here's my e-mail.

If I'm playing D&amp;D; 4E every week for a year, then it's probably better to make a D&amp;D; 4E specific handout. But in cases where you are playing a different game weekly, it makes less sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nA handout about your specific group or organization is also a good way to go. We play weekly here in the park. To find out what we're playing next week, go here. Or give me your phone number and I will text you. Or many other options. Youtube videos on a website is a great idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply exchanging emails can also be a good solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut different solutions will work with different people and different situations. And often we can't predict what they will be or prequalify who we are reaching. It's impossible to say one solution is better than another divorced of context, trial use, and measured results. And what works now may not work later and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo what you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo many things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake mistakes fearlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnalyze.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nRevise.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake mistakes faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222133/#Comment_222133" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T22:36:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2009 10:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Brennan, if you do this thing, I wanna translate it into Swedish and get something like whatarestorygames.com/se.
