The reason I ask is that I've just been to one of the happiest smiliest Gen Cons ever and there seemed to be much less of an out-there story gaming presence. That's not to say that many of those good people weren't there (although I did miss many that weren't) but they were functioning in what seemed like a different, perhaps quieter, perhaps less "we're in this against something (something not necessarily well or easily defined)"-way.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that the story project has in many ways succeeded in changing a lot of what happens in games and is gradually seeping into the greater conciousness, or even being welcomed there.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>(I orginally wrote indie instead of story but thought the latter was less inflammatory.

That's about the most odd ball out there game there is (in terms of how it plays).  I remember explaining the mechanics.  How everyone just goes around the table contributing one thing to the fiction.  How the cards in Flashpoint constrain who contributes and what they can contribute.<br/><br/>No one blinked an eye.  No surprised looks.  No protests.  No looks of doubt, disbelief or disappointment.<br/><br/>And then we just played.  It was awesome because I remember people actively FIGHTING me the first time I brought out InSpectres five to eight years earlier.

A lot of the game concepts that seemed alien or really difficult to implement just 5 years ago seem much more possible and accessible now.  Personally, I hit a brick wall a few years back with a few of my designs, which were just beyond my ability to really implement well, but the advances in thinking and product design and audience familiarity/willingness in the last few years have led me to return to some of them and feel like I can make progress again.  It definitely feels different now, whether that is perception or reality.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, this plateau is just the beginning. Fighting for "games can do / be about different things" was a worthy thing, but that should have been obvious from the get-go, right?  There are so many important battles that people are beginning to chip away it -- about accessibility, about product design, about inclusivity, about handling different kinds of content, about changing people's thinking and behavior, about mixing methods, etc.  Plus, once the impossible games become increasingly possible, it's time to expand our vision to things beyond what we can easily imagine.<br/><br/>Can we make games that emulate documentary films? Can we make games that don't try to emulate another form of media at all, but really embrace gaming as its own medium? Can we make games that will save people's lives? Etc, etc. There's so much left to do.<br/><br/>Also, "phases" like this can only really be diagnosed in retrospect. It's much easier to talk about the phase we just left than whatever phase is happening now or will happen next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338170/#Comment_338170" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T04:41:29+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  4:41AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a feeling, as mentioned above, that it's a bit like the discovery that not only is light not all one colour, but there are colours even beyond what we can see at the moment.<br/><br/>I looked in a few gamestores in Virginia and they had D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Rifts, WoD, not even any Call of Cthulhu, let alone GUMSHOE or FATE. Games on Demand at Gen Con helps (400 gamers in 4 days) but many of those are old hands rather than newly illuminated and the advertising needs to be bumped up to reach a wider audience. I think the Ennies does much to reach out and show what small press can do and there is no doubt that the big boys have been watching and learning.<br/><br/>Perhaps it will take one person (maybe Ed Healy and his mad 60 day dash around the US), to raise the awareness and involvement even further, to broaden the community. I imagine that things will change from inside too. The vibe amongst the indie crowd at Gen Con was less one of guerilla gaming than it had been in the past. I'm just not sure what that vibe is now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338172/#Comment_338172" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T05:42:14+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  5:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>the big boys have been watching and learning.</blockquote>\nOr, depending on how you look at it, "borrowing without attribution".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338181/#Comment_338181" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T06:26:04+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  6:26AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time to get serious and maybe even, ambitious?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338182/#Comment_338182" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T06:28:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  6:28AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

And any fight should not be discounted just because it was won and is now in the past. What seems obvious at one time was not obvious before. <br/><br/>I think we've all got stories like Jesse's -- that "before and after" picture of the transition that took place over the last eleven or so years.<br/><br/>Mine was RPG.net. I remember talking about Kickers in 2001 or so -- the notion that the Players come up with what they want their Characters to be engaged with in terms of story; that the GM doesn't have plot or an adventure. Now, I'm not claiming utter novelty for the notion of Kickers in RPG play (though as a rule for play, it clearly was.) <br/><br/>What I am saying I was told, literally, to shut up an stop talking about it. I was told -- who today comes to these boards and is a peer to many story game  folks people in the LA game community -- to get off the RPG forum and take it to the Game Design forum, since clearly Kickers were a) not worthy of talking about in an RPG forum and b) the mere presence of the discussion is too much to bear.<br/><br/>Now, one can say, "Well of course that shouldn't have been happening." But it did. All the time. Just <i>talking</i> about this stuff seemed to rile up the strangest responses. And now? People are happily mixing and matching and trying new games and openly talking about all sorts of games over at RPG.net. That's a big change. <br/><br/>So, in my view, the phase story games are entering is "normal."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338183/#Comment_338183" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T06:40:58+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  6:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there was plenty of ambition three or four years ago.

Sell your game based on the idea that it will sensitize the players to the real-world racism all around them, and you'll get a reaction.  The total lack of a screaming match over Kagematsu still surprises me; it was perfect for that kind of storm.<br/><br/>Not that I want an enraged RPGnet, mind you.

Hell, one of them is my roommate! True, she's new to the gaming scene, comparatively, but her friends (and her boyfriend) have been gaming since they were kids, and all they "see" are D&amp;D and trading card games. I've been telling them about things that can be found in story-ish games that might interest them (such as trying to sell them on Anima Prime, since they're all big fans of Final Fantasy), but man, it's like pulling teeth sometimes! I mean, if they're going to be complaining about how their 4E campaign doesn't hit their needs for gripping story and building relationships with NPCs, they should at least try to listen to some new ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338204/#Comment_338204" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T07:56:46+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  7:56AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another fight that was hard-fought but now the outcome seems foregone: you don't need to sell your game to a publisher for it to succeed, you can publish and support it yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338210/#Comment_338210" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T08:27:05+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  8:27AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2011 8:31AM by Wordman.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Now, one can say, "Well of course that shouldn't have been happening."

They've started pitching games to entirely new audiences: anime fans, DIY crafters, zinesters, people looking for grassroots religious experiences (in Joel's case). Joel's got a game that's received more attention outside the gaming community than within it.<br/><br/>If we're talking manifesto: We need to create and share games that can instantly capture the hearts of those outside our weird bubble.

bitter?<br/><br/>neither.<br/><br/>well. maybe a little glib because i didn't back it up with anything., but i was giving my honest opinion of the stage indie games are in. not everyone looks at the entire time-line of game design from the 1800s to present. as such, there's this wide-eyed impression that, "wow. we figured out where hitler's gold is. we can do this forever." and actually, you can't.<br/><br/>d20 failed because there wasn't a licensing fee and anyone with a typewriter could smash out a book and called it "game material" even if it had 100+ pages of history and 4 pages of mechanics. ugh. don't make me name the book i am talking about.<br/><br/>i can see the difference between a game and a product. i can banter about what i love and still say it failed because of X Y and Z (a few dozen games come to mind), or point to something that's monetarily successful and show you why it's not technically a game. i've actually worked all sides of the industry and hobby. and having attended conventions for over 20 years i can honestly say, i've listened to every kind of player tell me why the love/hate what they love/hate. and so while i myself love/hate/enjoy story games, i also recognize that it's reached saturation. i can see more ideas coming out than people have the patience to read. and this notion that story-games are somehow immune to the pitfalls of traditional games is a bit naive.<br/><br/>story games are not shadowrun and that's a good thing. but bob the "product publisher" who calls himself a game designer even though he writes shadowrun adventures (which makes him none of those things) is going to make stuff every year despite the universes lack of need for another adventure where the PCs steal money from the corporations and then get cheated by their employer. one can easily draw parallels to events going on the story community as well.<br/><br/>and the beauty of this environment is that this idealism that gaming can be something is amazing to me because it shows that NOT having that history and timeline perspective means someone other than me is going to branch out and try to design that "crossover" game. they won't ever succeed. but i will love watching them try. and that's what makes all this matter.<br/><br/>so. i sort of contradicted myself. and i think that's okay.                        </div>\n<div

But the seeds are being sown.<br/><br/><b>Jim:</b> Yeah, indie games didn't "invent" any of these ideas necessarily.  So what?  Also, most games that get produced may not be totally successful.  I don't see how that matters either.  There's more people in the community who have a solid perspective on that than you might think.  Also, only playing 3 out of 50 indie games sounds like a tremendous waste to me.

I totally disagree.<br/><br/>Magic the fucking Gathering is still doing this, despite all the limitations built into that game--the card types, the mana system, the deckbuilding system, etc--so certainly roleplaying game design as a whole can do it. I may be misinterpreting you, Jim, but to me you're saying that innovation stops, eventually. And I look around at my world, and can't but disagree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338607/#Comment_338607" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T13:08:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  1:08PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding sales, most RPGs don't release their sales numbers - but Evil Hat does, and we can potentially compare relative rankings because ICv2 releases rankings for the RPG.  In Q3 of 2010, the Dresden Files RPG made the top 5 RPGs.  Here's Fred Hicks' <a href="http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2010/10/evil-hat-sales-numbers-q3-2010/" rel="nofollow"><b>Q3 2010 Sales Numbers post</b></a> with combined 3061 DFRPG book sales through "distribution orders" and 4427 DFRPG book sales total.  And here's cyclopeatron's report on the <a href="http://cyclopeatron.blogspot.com/2010/10/pathfinder-ties-4e-in-sales-did-hasbro.html" rel="nofollow"><b>post on ICv2 Q3 2010 sales</b></a>.  We can't do this for other quarters because DFRPG didn't make the top 5 (although if someone paid a bunch they could get the ICv2 full report - I don't).  For comparison, here is Vincent Baker's <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=566" rel="nofollow"><b>2010 sales numbers</b></a>.  What I get from this - Dresden Files and Spirit of the Century sold in the thousands.  Apocalypse World sold 174 in Q3 2010.  I suspect the only games on the order of Apocalypse World would be Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard, which I don't have sales numbers for.  <br/><br/>I think it's important to note that Rob Donoghue and Ryan Macklin helped freelance write the Leverage RPG for Margaret Weis Productions.  So to some degree, the indie movement is certainly merging with the mainstream.  Note that although Mouse Guard is solely written and copyright by Luke Crane, it is printed and distributed through Artesia author Mark Smylie's company Archaia Press.  Also note that the main channel for DFRPG and SOTC are hobby store distribution orders, not direct sales.  I think that these are milestones in integration of indie RPGs and traditional RPG authoring and distribution.  Whether you see this as indie authors gaining ground or selling out may depend on your point of view.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite><b>Jim:</b>Yeah, indie games didn't "invent" any of these ideas necessarily.  So what?  Also, most games that get produced may not be totally successful.  I don't see how that matters either.  There's more people in the community who have a solid perspective on that than you might think.  Also, only playing 3 out of 50 indie games sounds like a tremendous waste to me. Even if you not going to play them more than once, why not play them?</blockquote>\nThe topic is the status of indie RPGs as a community and movement - and one subtopic is how ideas from there have seeped into the greater consciousness.  If that's what we're looking at, I think it is important to differentiate between (1) ideas that were in the mainstream already, and (2) ideas that the indie RPG community put into the mainstream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338611/#Comment_338611" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T13:50:30+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  1:50PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            J. Walton. Wow. You so missed the point. I have 47 indies games I haven't played because there isn't enough time to enjoy everything I want to play. Hence. Saturation. In the tubes, this is known as Eschaton, where more words will be written than people can ever read. We're already seeing it.<br/><br/>Hans. No. Innovation doesn't stop. Innovation within a medium does. We don't make amazing ball-bearing housings for horse-drawn carriages anymore. We've moved on to ball-bearing housings for automotive axles. Which eventually are replaced by self-contained units that never need to be oiled, but must be machined on a lathe. Until someone invents a frictionless axle housing and ball-bearings are obsolete.<br/><br/>Video games will eventually eclipse and make games like D&amp;D obsolete. They must. Because the social value inherent in the structure of that game does not compete with the value of "data at my finger tips" and "instant dungeons." But a dungeon crawl is still a dungeon crawl, whether it's diablo, under mountain, or the true dungeon at gencon. One could make comparative analysis that one is more fun than the other (for them), but you can't tell me they are different. If I play Montsegur and I replace the Cathars with captain kirk and the Catholics with Khan, am I really playing a different game? Or am I playing with different color? NFL Monopoly is still unenjoyable.<br/><br/>Eventually, story games will go through the same pains that Traditional Games went through in 1992. And in less than half the time it took traditional games to get there. Being aware of that doesn't make you a downer, it means understanding trends. Again. I love story games. I would rather be playing fiasco right now than talking to you guys. We all should want to be doing that. But it doesn't change the fact that some day someone is going to say. Ugh. I'm sick of this framing scenes, conflicting resolution nonsense. Can't we just go play catch?<br/><br/>ASIDE: As for Magic, designing cards inside the model of a CCG is not game design. It's card design. Actually a very different skill set. Designing a sustainable CCG in today's market is unheard of. WoW exists because of it's IP. Yu-Gi-Oh because of the cartoon associated with it. Others because of their legacy. But there are few if any new CCG launches. Mayfair and FFG are among the two strongest companies at gencon. Neither has a CCG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338618/#Comment_338618" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T14:33:42+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  2:33PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2011 2:36PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said I was going to stay out of this thread.

What about ideas that were developing in the mainstream in parallel with ideas in the indie RPG community? What about ideas that the mainstream put into the indie RPG community? What about ideas that either community drew from video games and then let seep into the other sector? What about ideas that mainstream RPGs put into video games that were developed and then reintegrated back into mainstream RPGs or indie RPGs? What about ideas that film put into either or both sectors? Etc.<br/><br/>Second, why is it important? What is the prize at stake that indie RPGs win, mainstream RPGs are denied, or that they both can share?<br/><br/>I know this isn't exactly what you're saying\u2014that assigning credit or awarding prizes or determining who gets to take possession of which ideas isn't necessarily what you're after\u2014but I am truly torn here. On the one hand, I think understanding the genealogy of games can be important. On the other hand, I am wary of assigning credit or victory points to one publishing model over the other (instead of individual games); of putting those models at odds. It strikes me as a setup to the kind of argument that says Game Y deserves only partial credit because it learned the lessons of Game X. Which is dubious to mine ears. So I am extra cautious.<br/><br/>More to the point, ideas are slippery and cheap. Execution matters. If a game does a great job accomplishing what it sets out to do, it doesn't earn more or fewer XP for having been informed by a game from the other sector. Does it?<br/><br/>It's interesting to see how games inform and inspire each other, sure. It can be enlightening and empowering. But why is it important that we track and label ideas based on where they originated? So we know what to praise and what to dismiss?<br/><br/>Forgive me, John, for reading a whole lot into that one comment. Please note that I'm not saying this is necessarily what you're getting at, John. I just wanted to draw a circle around something that makes me fret.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Why is it important to differentiate between those ideas?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will<br/><br/>(Edited for precision.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338619/#Comment_338619" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T14:35:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  2:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What pains did traditional games go through in 1992?<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338624/#Comment_338624" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T15:54:35+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  3:54PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will.

I took a bunch of art history courses\u2014I'd love to take companion courses on game history, too. ("Then we enter the post-D&amp;D era...") Never mind the fact that we'd be largely unable to agree on movements, eras, labels, or descriptors, I imagine. <br/><br/>That "games are fluff" bit isn't really in play here, though. Who's saying that? My point is that understanding or attributing things based on the individual games that sparked them is more important than doing so based on the (ideological? practical? political?) camp\u2014indie versus mainstream\u2014that a game supposedly belongs to. That strikes me as scorekeeping for fuzzy-bordered, misshapen, ill-defined teams... and the perpetuation of the idea that there are two teams isn't especially helpful in this area, is it?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong. I'm genuinely asking. <br/><br/>To tie this back to Steve's original question, my larger point is this: I agree with the earlier post that says it's much easier to identify a phase as one leaves it than it is as one enters it. I'm not sure even a highly informed opinion can predict the future and thus name the next phase accurately. That said, I do think this is a fruitful question\u2014I've been delighted by the discussion here. So thanks, Steve, for starting this orientation thread where we stop and look around for a moment. <br/><br/>I'll back out, though, before I derail this thread any further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338709/#Comment_338709" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T09:33:51+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  9:33AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2011 9:35AM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Story Gaming community is growing. There are probably more people here we don't know personally than we do know.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the Story Games community is going to move to Google Plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttendance at conventions that heavily feature Story Games are up overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're seeing less desire and pressure to publish. Especially publish by Gen Con. Which means less pressure to be an exhibitor at Gen Con. Which also means more games like Lady Blackbird.<br/>\n<br/>\nGen Con is getting more expensive for publishers. And there are more avenues outside of Gen Con to reach a larger audience like PAX and Anime / Manga conventions. Comic Con will eventually become a viable place for Story Games. We may see less of a presence of major game designers at more play focused conventions that are not local to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore traditional publishers are going to hire Story Game designers to work for them. More RPG game designers will be hired by large companies to work on computer, mobile, and social media games.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople in general are more accepting of the idea of playing social games. It seems easier to get someone who has never played a social game before to play one. Which means it's just as easy to play a Story Game as it is to play D&amp;D.; Story Games often have the benefit of being casual short term play friendly. But D&amp;D; is also stepping this up by organizing and promoting their Encounters program.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're also seeing more Story Game mechanics sneaking their way into more mainstream games. Even if many of these Story Game mechanics have been around for a very long term, longer than this community.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe line between boardgame and story game continues to blur. I know more and more boardgame fans trying more story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more local fan driven conventions that heavily feature Story Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more "Games on Demand" type events.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy read on Gen Con\u2026 it's become more family friendly. It grew by 20% (around 6,000 people) but at least half of that growth is due to family friendly events offered over the weekend. I also don't know if babies and very small children are included in those attendance numbers. My guess is no, but we saw many young children.

Which alleys? No particular reason.<br><br/>I think this thread is suffering from a lack of William Gibson perspective on trends and technology. Trying to track a social movement as its occurring (I would call story games a subversive social group) is really difficult. I like reading everyone's opinion, though really, it's more about pattern recognition. Which trends are happening and why they're happening is hard to spot in the indie community. One it seems like everyone has spotted is in this thread that more and more people feel that game design is accessible, and because of that new hot shit is popping up all the time. Seems like lots of people are saying that in the subtext of their posts in this thread.<br/><br/>It seems like whether that's a mainstream vs indie argument is kind of tangential from the main point: lots of people like the freedom to create their own games and play with people who enjoy what they enjoy. And as more hot shit pops up in all these small places all over the world, more people join in the community at large, and the community grows. Exciting. It's a bit like the accessibility of the internet... 20 years ago there were still people in bumfuck Idaho who couldn't get internet reception. Now its so pervasive, the global community is accessible for so many more people. I can see this idea reflected in gaming, and story games in particulr.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338728/#Comment_338728" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T12:32:50+00:00" title="August 14, 2011 12:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2011 12:38PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite><br/>i can appreciate that you and anyone else on the "hobby" side of gaming has this outlook that the story games renaissance is in full swing, but gencon showed me that saturation has begun and next year sales will be down for most booths as consumers have too many choices.</blockquote>\nOh, you may be totally right about this!

It was pretty clear from the outset that he was skeptical of Ron's pitch - and in fact seemed completely terrified at the prospect of a non-traditional RPG. In the end, he backed away from the booth in much the same way you'd separate yourself from a knife-wielding PCP addict. Not that Ron was being confrontational, but the idea of story gaming was so far removed from what that guy considered proper roleplaying that it looked like he'd found himself in a really dark, frightening alley and desperately wanted out.<br/><br/>This guy was a random sampling of 35,000 people who attended that weekend - but I suspect he wasn't the only one of his kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338737/#Comment_338737" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T14:29:40+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  2:29PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Is it worth mentioning that, for a while, the Forge booth at GenCon was the largest booth dedicated solely to RPGs, save possibly for WotC?<br/><br/>I'm stil not sure how much I like the term "story games", but I think that, as RPGs go, they are pretty much it.

The saturation for attention already hit one peak around 2006-2007, when more games were produced than even most hardcore indie games fans could play or be familiar with.  I remember having those conversations at GenCon in 2006.  People were like, "I don't even know a bunch of these games!"  Soon it's going to be the case that even the quote "important/significant" games are going to be too numerous for any one person to play, no matter how much they love indie games.<br/><br/>But I think that's okay.  There are way too many great movies produced every year that I don't have time to see, but SOMEBODY watches them.  I may not get around to playing <i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i> this year, but someone will.  The attention market is much more expandable and flexible than the market for $$$.  And due to the increasing ease of publishing something (free, POD, crowdfunding, etc.), as long as you can find 20-50 people who love what you produce (which isn't that hard) indie games will keep rolling along.  Sometimes people produce duds that don't get enough attention to really make any splash.  But that's cool too.  They do something different next time.<br/><br/>The way indie games work, coming from several different inter-related communities of game designers, not needing much monetary success in order to be considered "successful" (see: Lady Blackbird), it's pretty distinct and -- I suspect -- largely immune from many of the forces at work in traditional game publishing.  As many people have pointed out over the years, indie games isn't really a business as much as it's a way of approaching the hobby that sometimes involves selling things but doesn't necessarily need to (and often involves playing or writing for D&amp;D or mainstream games as well).<br/><br/>Just a different perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338766/#Comment_338766" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T18:10:22+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  6:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am aware of the love in the "hobby" for the art of game design vs. the interest in the "industry" for the craft of game design.<br/><br/>I merely think the "market" is saturated.

I totally recognize that there's a lot of stuff being tried out there, and a lot of experimentation. And there's bound to be some stuff in there that's going to be important for some people.<br/><br/>But story games designers and fans are not a subversive social group. As a group, story gamers are not subversive in any way, shape, or form. Heck, not are they not subversive, they're not even especially turned outwards.<br/><br/>I'm not being dismissive of all the cool stuff that's happening, or of the subversive ideas being thrown around out there. But there's a far cry between this and acting as a subversive social group, which is to say a group of people mobilized as an active force for deep-rooted change in society.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I was going to add that educational and simulation-oriented roleplaying and training has been used for many years, so the idea that you can accomplish something with it doesn't seem controversial to me (but again, see above, nothing new.)</blockquote>\nTo me neither, actually.<br/><br/>I'm what sort of riled up about is the idea of story gamers as a subversive social group (see above.) To me, the only thing this kind of thinking helps along is the status quo. It's typical magicial thinking one often sees in teenagers: that somehow, just by wanting the world to be different, they're an agent for change (god knows <i>I</i> fell prey to this in my own teenage years.)<br/><br/>In another thread where I was discussing the current state of best practices discussions, a couple of people glibly told be to "be the change you want to see." Well, this is basically what I'm saying, here: if you want to see stuff in society be subverted, you are not acting toward this by being a story gamer. You are not part of a group that effects social changes, or even seeks to (although some individual in the group do.) Pretending like somehow the fact that you're into story games matters to the course of society is tantamount to sitting on your ass and doing nothing.<br/><br/>Mind you, for me, this takes <i>nothing</i> away from story games and RPGs in general. They're a leisure activity, and sometimes a thought-provoking one at that. Not everything has to be about social change, and I think it's actually healthy to take part in leisure activities that are (mostly) not about anything else than leisure. So I'm not saying that story games should do more to impact society... I'm just saying that story gamers who wish to impact society should look elsewhere for ways to get involved in just that.

I think you make a point that's valid for you, because its your opinion. I can even say that I agree that story games don't affect people on the level of say... feminism.<br/><br/>But then I go, wait. Leisure activities involving creative thought, process, and social interaction do, to me, have impact. Maybe the preciseness of my language in my original post in regards to the subcultures of William Gibson novels was a bit extreme if only to illuminate the metaphor a bit more (all of Gibson's groups are accidental trends that emerge within society, not meaning to have social impact but end up growing to be huge change makers... like the people who do branding and marketing in Patter Recognition, for example. I would define most of Gibson's stories to be about subversive social groups). Maybe there's better words to be used. I don't, to use your example, believe we're a punk rock movement piercing through the mediocrity of non-roleplayer's minds with our awesome liberty spikes.<br/><br/>I think of roleplaying and game design as important art forms in my world. I think other people on these forums and elsewhere do as well. I think that as gamers our social groups are meaningful and are changing the way people think about play, design, and interactivity in important ways. In fact, there's a lot of talk in the bigger media of game design and how important it is in the world today. Story games is a subsection, granted. <br/><br/>But think about the social impact of groups of roleplayers playing Kagematsu, for example. How does this game communicate important cultural ideas about feminism by cleverly dealing with Judith Butler's ideas of performing gender? That, to me, is important impact.<br/><br/>Maybe you're right about "subversive social group". But I certainly wouldn't call it meaningless, unimportant, and only a hobby. If it's that to you, that's cool. But to me, roleplaying is important!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338998/#Comment_338998" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T06:57:23+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  6:57AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Anansigirl">@Anansigirl</a>: I agree that story games, like all other forms of media, can definitely challenge how people think. And I definitely think they can be a powerful tool for other social groups to help structure their thought or enact their agenda. What made me jump in your statement (which I've also read before) is the idea of story gamers themselves as a social group enacting change. That I don't buy.<br/><br/>I get what you're saying, though. I think it amounts to whether or not you believe ideas are enough to enact social change or not. Coming from social work (which is influenced by popular education and grassroot-movements here in Qu\xe9bec), my own frame of reference is that they aren't. As such, I don't think story gamers qualify as a subversive social group until they collectively act to create social change in a subversive fashion. (And I don't necessarily think they should either.)<br/><br/>Like I said though, I get what you're saying a lot better, so thanks for taking the time to clarify. I think we might just be looking at this from two very different points of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338999/#Comment_338999" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T06:57:59+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  6:57AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one only need read the output of RPGpundit and his acolytes to see how unsettling story games are to some people. I wouldn't overstate the subversiveness of story games beyond roleplaying but many people (several million probably) have a lot invested in a one true way of gaming, and most of those aren't story gamers. Story gaming was difficult and unsettling for many of them. There is plenty of evidence for this. I don't think any wider subversion is meant or implied and as this is a story gaming forum, it's entirely appropriate to talk about story gaming as our main subject of interest.<br/><br/>Although the subversiveness of story gaming isn't the core idea behind this topic, subversion is a way of changing things. One area where story gamers tend to have a different attitude to that which you might find on other gaming fora is that of attitudes to women (or other minorities in gaming). Story gamers have engaged with this through games and in other ways and whilst a measured and reasoned approach is helpful, sometimes there's nothing like a smack in the face* to make people notice that there are other ways of doing things.<br/><br/>So I'm all up for some subversion, that's why I wrote Tbilisi! which criticises rpg theory. It got just the reception I was expecting at the Forge (i.e. Why would you do such a thing?).<br/><br/>*A metaphorical one, in case you hadn't realised.

I lead a -still small but growing- publishing company. We make entertainment in the form of comic books and a bi-monthly newspaper called "El Oniichan", that centers around mocking the characters of mainstream products and the impact they have in the actual peruvian lifestyle. And now we plan to get into publishing RPGs.<br/><br/>Now, how is that new or revolutionary in any way? It's something that hasn't been done before here in Peru to this extent. Not at least in the last 30 years. The reaction of the audience says a lot, even when we only print 1000 copies of each publication, we keep selling them. Even when retailers that actually distribute comics in Peru are still less than a dozen and we hadn't conventions of any sort until 2008. We are launching our first event this september and expect 600 attendants for a 8 hour party+show+comic market. I've been working in the community for about 20 years and it's the first time I actually get to feel my work is leading somewhere. <br/><br/>My point is: Yeah, revolution takes a lot of work and a lot of time. It isn't an event, like history books could mislead you to think. You need to built speed and mass, and then elements react by their own and the thing explodes in your face. And even when that happens, you won't probably be able to tell the difference until a few years later. I doubt people will call what we are doing here a "revolution", unless it actually succeds at getting somewhere. I call it a revolution because the term gives me an idea of how much work needs to be done, not because of what I'm gonna get once it's done. Perhaps it's the same, wherever you are. You can feel something is happening, and it's at least enough tangible to start a thread about it. I'd say you are going the right way, and like us here, all you need is to keep pushing, getting stuff actually done, published/distributed and being played. Whether you get somewhere or not, nobody could tell there wasn't an indie games explosion in the early years of the 21th century <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339038/#Comment_339038" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T11:55:35+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say, Jocelyn?

You remember when you started a thread in good faith, and Shreyas and some others fought you tooth and nail to try to tell you<i>who you are?</i>Remember how you (justifiably!) railed against that? I think some of us who DO identify as a "subversive group" or something like it may be feeling the same way about your comments here. I certainly am. So I'd like to ask that you not tell us who we are. Say who YOU are; great. Say "I don't identify as a member of a subversive group when I play story games." But please don't tell us who We are or who we aren't.</blockquote>\nI'm not telling you who you are. If you say that while playing / designing story games, you consider that you are being subversive of the larger social order and enacting change on a societal level, I totally believe you. It is indeed not my place to say what you do or don't identify as.<br/><br/>However, what I've stated is my opinion that such a belief is misguided and that if you want to be an actor of social change, you should get involved with movements or organizations that have social change as a goal instead. Your games can color your involvement in such movements, sure, but for me the story games milieu itself is not an agent of social change.<br/><br/>You're welcome to your opinion on this issue, and I'm welcome to mine as well, I think.<br/><br/>This said, I'm totally open to be proven wrong. Someone could easily demonstrate to me that, in itself, the story gamers as a group is an intentional agent for social change. All you have to do is answer the same question I asked Christopher Weeks: "What actions do story gamers take - as a group - that is first and foremost meant to bring on change (even the tiniest one) on a societal level?" Because that's what a subversive social group is - it's a group that acts in a way that has subversion of the current social norms as its primary goal. This is why I'm not buying story gamers as a subversive social group - it's not a goal shared by the group and the <i>group</i> isn't taking on actions that have subversion as their primary goal. Explain to me why I'm wrong on those two counts, and I'll gladly change my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339050/#Comment_339050" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T12:41:45+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 12:41PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>First, I think you're wrong when you claim that you can't subvert by accident.</blockquote>\nActually, you're right. I agree you can subvert by accident. But I think this doesn't make you subversive, because the intent wasn't there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>Also, I think that game designers and game players are absolutely creating interactive, social, creative media on purpose as their primary intent.  And out of curiosity, which designers are you meaning when you make the claim that they're in it primarily to make money and not wreak change upon the world?  I bet some of them would disagree.</blockquote>\nAgain, you're right about the profit thing. I should've written "make a profit and/or entertain". I recognize that some designers (most, maybe) aren't seeking to make a profit. I think that all of them, however, aim to entertain. I really can't see anyone in the hobby right now say to themselves "man, this game is going to be pretty boring, but it's subversive value is up the wazoo, so I'm satisfied with it." (Actually, I think my quote actually describes Human Occupied Landfill pretty well... which is funny since it was published by White Wolf.)<br/><br/>If I'm getting you right, however, you're saying that partaking in any interactive media is by nature subversive. I'm... not sure that I agree with this, but by that definition, you're right that story games are subversive. (And I definitely think discussing the subversiveness or not of interactive media is waaaaaaaaay beyond the scope of this thread. You've given me food for thought, in any case.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>When you ask what we do "as a group," what does that mean?</blockquote>\nI meant any action meant primarily to bring on social change. My claim here is that the primary goal of people designing games is to entertain, and that the primary goal of people playing games is to be entertained. Some of them can choose to be subversive on top of this, but not everyone in the group shares that goal, so it can't be claimed to be the group's (story gamers as a whole) goal.<br/><br/>Again, if what you're saying that any interactive media is subversive, then the primary goal to entertain / be entertained in an interactive manner is subversive and this fits the bill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339051/#Comment_339051" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T12:46:44+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 12:46PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>My point is: Yeah, revolution takes a lot of work and a lot of time.</blockquote>\nWhat Paulo said.

Is that what you're wiggling around on?  I mean, sure, you're setting it up so that if you can point to a single person who played a "story game" once who has zero interest in subversion, then "story gamers" aren't subversive.  But that's crap and I'm not sure if you're doing that on purpose or I'm reading too much into it or what.  I can't see your face even.<br/><br/>But "story gamers" is just this group of people who like a thing.  I've watched a trend for ten years; at The Forge and here and elsewhere among these people, lots of us who might identify or be reasonably identified as story gamers, where we reach out to non-gamers and play our games with them.  Maybe it's because it's easier to train them than brain-damaged WoD players or maybe because we want more women to play these games or maybe we just like these other people.  But this trend is us reaching out and modifying what other people -- non-gamers, do with their free time.  Subverting the social order.  Doesn't that count in this arena?

(The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art) Part of his attempt to critique rpgs as a performing art includes the thesis that participating in role-playing games (in general, not any particular version of them) is subversive of capitalist entertainment by its very nature, since it opposes the one-way producer-to-consumer model that Christopher, Levi, Paulo, and Joel have mentioned. It's fairly involved and academic, but the basics make a lot of sense to me.<br/><br/>Funny enough, Tavis Allison once said he though this section was tacked on to satisfy a Marxist thesis adviser. I thought that was weird, but I'm a noob in academia.<br/><br/>I'm not particularly interested in being part of the discussion here in this thread or anything, but I thought I'd mention this in case you (or anybody else) is interested.

I personally identify with being a part of this group as well as other role-playing sub-groups.  However, I don't identify with that group being "subversive".  <br/><br/>In general, I believe that role-playing games - whether or not they are considered story games - are a positive/healthy creative outlet, and would encourage them in all sorts of people.  They are important, and have formed the basis for lots of social interaction and relationships.  <br/><br/>However, I don't feel subversive within this community because I don't feel like there is a particular target that we as a whole community are trying to subvert.  Likewise, I think that music is an important and valuable part of life, but I don't think that the music scene is a subversive group.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>But "story gamers" is just this group of people who like a thing.

I can start with a much smaller definition. I think story-gamers are definitely trying to subvert the status quo in the RPG hobby industry. And through GoD at GenCon and our own little cons and meetups we are doing that in an organized fashion. <br/><br/>There are also those of us who are trying to upset larger orders on a small scale. My social circles are largely composed of people who have swallowed the pill that says raising children is about driving them to classes where they learn stuff, then watching them do that until your time is totally filled. I am intentional about introducing games to them to show them we can spend time interacting with our children instead of chauffeuring them and spectating. Now I'm not part of a group that is trying to do that, but give me time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339083/#Comment_339083" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T15:10:20+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  3:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>I'm not telling you who you are.

I know we live in a very self-aware time, but generally people who want to make change do better when they don't talk about what they are doing and just do it more.<br/><br/>There is a lot of great creativity going on in the game design community these days and some boundaries are being pushed.  But when you've spent all day at a Board of Ed hearing to try and get a kid moved to a different school because he is so disruptive that other teachers can't even teach their class but you also know that the kid sleeps under the kitchen table because that's the only space for him and never eats breakfast, RPG designers talking about "subversive social change" seems a tad overblown.<br/><br/>There is a real world out there and it is in bad shape.  Playing games is a crucial part of living and ultimately that kind of entertainment has influence.  But as a tool for making significant social change, they aren't super high up on the list of priorities right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339178/#Comment_339178" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T03:42:44+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  3:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 3:51AM by GB_Steve.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give it a rest.

The indie designers will continue to push boundaries (are there even boundaries) and look for more interesting veins in which to create. I don't know if a true crossover game can be created, simply because of the mindset of traditional gamers. It's like walking up to the dude dressed like an owl bear and saying "hey, want to play charades"? Fiasco is the closest I've seen in being a gateway drug to the world of story gaming, but I have a feeling that this will continue to be trad v. indie for a long, long time. <br/><br/>Segment Two: Designers in a fit of nostalgia will revisit their early gaming days and rehash old favorites. We'll see more traditional/fantasy-set games that will be redone with simpler rule sets and a more story-telling focus rather than a crunchy numbers base. You meet at the local tavern, you end up with a quest, you go dungeon crawling, you kill and loot... and you bask in the memories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339188/#Comment_339188" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T06:04:05+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  6:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 6:05AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I think that between Jocelyn being annoying and Joel getting annoyed, we've killed this thread.

As annoyances and topics that kill threads?<br/><br/>I'm really sorry, guys. I think I might have misread the story-games forum and its culture somewhat. I was under the impression that this was a good place to think critically about this stuff, but looking back of what GB Steve said, I realize that pretty much all the threads here are about how awesome and socially important story games are. I sort of missed that at first - whereas now it's pretty clear that this forum is akin to [Whatever+] threads or the D&amp;D/d20 subforum over on RPG.net.<br/><br/>My apologies to those of you I've annoyed, and rest assured that from now on I'll post accordingly with the forum's norm of sticking to analysis and highlighting of the things that are awesome about story games. If I ever feel the need to have a critical discussion again, I'll try to find another venue for it. (If you guys have any good forums for this kind of discussion that you'd like to suggest to me, I'd be grateful for any links you can send my way.)<br/><br/>And thanks to those of you who've put up with me and bothered replying in this thread. This whole passive versus interactive thing really has given me food for thought and challenged my way of thinking about this stuff. Hopefully, wherever I end up having my two-sided discussions will have posters like you guys who can get me to think about stuff differently.<br/><br/>Anyway.

I was only speaking for myself. In fact, I suspect my posting method is in the minority around here.<br/><br/>2) I'm not at all saying that discussions have to be one-sided, or only talk about how awesome things are. I'm just saying I find it far easier to engage when we're talking about personal experience. Sharing negative experience works just great, like "We struggled with that when we played," or "I tried that and it really derailed the game," or "when someone tried that on our groiup, it was no fun for me." That I can engage with far better than a simple statement of opinion, divorced from experience.<br/><br/>Maybe my use of words like "celebrate" made you think it was all about one-sided agreement? I just mean "celebrate" in the sense that life is beautiful and humanity is beautiful, even when it's filled with pain or struggle, and when I get all wrapped up in debating a point I lose sight of that. I WANT to hear experiences that are different from my own. Again, I'm just sharing what would help me have conversations with you. Take it as you will, and I'm not shooing you off of Story Games by any means!<br/><br/>3) I guess I have a hard time separating the "social relevance" and "gaming relevance" of Story games.

Searching through forums and picking through a zillion threads for nuggets of wisdom doesn't count.  Nor does being given 300 different "must play" game recommendations from 100 different aficionados.  <br/><br/>We need a more user-friendly trove of knowledge.  I've made some efforts to nudge the Forge Glossary toward being that, but that effort didn't go as I'd hoped.<br/><br/>So, big picture-wise, I'm guessing we're in part of the "post-WoD* baby steps" phase.  99% of what current story gamers have innovated will be forgotten and reinvented later.  The 1% that will survive makes me happy, though.<br/><br/>*the mid-'90s explosion of World of Darkness games being the last "phase" of large-scale relevance that I can identify                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339316/#Comment_339316" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T17:28:48+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  5:28PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, within the history of just indie RPGs, perhaps this phase is "back to basics vs forward to new horizons"?  There seems to be a good amount of enthusiasm going around for both (a) taking new wisdom to old-school gaming and (b) venturing into activities that may or may not count as tabletop roleplaying.  <br/><br/>This is also kind of a "mentoring" phase, as newcomers have a lot of options for who to ask about game design.  The two or three most useful Forge insights seem to be pretty easy to run into around here.  <br/><br/>Hopefully a lot of us are getting our itch for structure scratched and can go on to design games that are neither old-style purposeless meanderings nor new-style 3-hour arcs with endgames.  I'd like to think we're entering a "just enough structure" phase, but I have no actual evidence of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339335/#Comment_339335" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T19:01:57+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  7:01PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>We need a more user-friendly trove of knowledge.</blockquote>\nThis.<br/><br/>I think the corpus of story games out there has grown to be so diverse that the single label of "it's a story game" doesn't say much.<br/><br/>For instance, I've <i>hated</i> my play experience with some games and really really liked some others.

Some you will like, some you won't; the only way to tell is by trial and experience. I fail to see why Story Games would be any different in this respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339398/#Comment_339398" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T06:37:35+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  6:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To keep this thread closed down like Steve asked, I've drifted the discussion that's starting now to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14926" rel="nofollow">this new thread.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14872/what-phase-are-story-games-entering/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14872/what-phase-are-story-games-entering">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14872/what-phase-are-story-games-entering/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14872/what-phase-are-story-games-entering/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14872%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14872%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
