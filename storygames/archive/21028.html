The games tended to go gonzo. 3e softened up the impression in prose, but the mechanics remained, IMO, pretty inclined to going gonzo. And then Chuubo's came out, which continued softening the prose impression. I can't comment on the mechanics, as I haven't played it yet, but aside from stronger pacing mechanics it looks like it's still mostly Nobilis.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure that the mechanics actually push for Gonzo play, so much as the incredible flexibility of the powers (and resultant conflicts) pushes for it, and nothing in the game constrains that trend. <br/><br/>What drives these thoughts is my questioning whether the really appealing part of Nobilis - the setting, the power scale, the resultant questions that emerge in play - are actually tied into the game itself, or whether these things can be ripped wholesale away from the Nobilis engine without loss, and stitched onto the bones of a system that better drives play.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461542/#Comment_461542" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-31T07:06:12+00:00" title="March 31, 2017  7:06AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Nobilis 3 times. Once, the GM ran on the fly for a bunch of us who got together at GenCon, and he streamlined the rules and came up with the plot during the post-chargen bathroom break, as is traditional.<br/><br/>Once, we had pregenerated PCs of such quality that when the Dragon was put on the table, we did not all grab for it, because ALL of the PCs were that cool. The guy who did want it took about a minute to a) confirm no one else did and b) to take boggle damage, because Dragon, right? It had a solid plot that was full of a gazillion possible paths to take, you know, the kind of thing that can go anywhere and creates structure just by existing.<br/><br/>That was at Origins, and the same folks ran a Nobilis larp later in the convention, which had streamlined rules and was full of awesome. The lights went low, and we all started philosophizing. Oh, and there was this lovely touch of envelopes that everyone started with and distributed to whomever they wanted. These were marked "give to a friend", "give to an enemy", "give to an ally", et cetera -- by giving them to someone, you were making them your friend, enemy, ally, whatever, and you didn't know what information was in them.<br/><br/>All of this was 2nd edition.

Eventually most player groups settle down into far more serious explorations once they built of those bonds of trust with everyone else at the table that they'll be allowed to use the power that the game provides them and that that power will be recognized.<br/><br/>That's when things get really interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462034/#Comment_462034" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T08:31:52+00:00" title="April 17, 2017  8:31AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobilis never worked for me and I think that is because my groups always fell in the other direction: Nothing much happened.

The rules lack a resolution system of any kind.</blockquote>\nsounds highly unlike Nobilis.<br/><br/>Your comment seems to look to the rules for permission to do something. The rules are built along a very particular line of "Yes, and." If your powers can even vaguely justify something, "yes." If they're opposed, "yes, and (it'll cost you miracle points)." It's rather along the lines of Apocalypse World in that way: you know the fiction, and as long as it's plausible in the fiction, then yes, you can do that.<br/><br/>Which is fitting for a game of gods. Yes, if there's any way you could possibly justify a fictional result given your powers, you can do that. We don't roll: you're a god, you can do that. Unless another God-like being opposes you.<br/><br/>Or at least, such was true in 2e. 3e gets weirder, since the Aspect system is now revised to sort of run in parallel with mortal action rules. So, although you'll still win every thing you could possibly *want* to win, Aspect is the one realm in which "unless another God-like being opposes you" gets replaced with "unless someone competent opposes you." Which, yes, feels weird, and is part of the incoherence I'm feeling in the 3e design.<br/><br/>There is so much I think I dislike about the Nobilis conflict resolution system, but "get <br/>nothing done" isn't on the list. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gustaf_s" title="gustaf_s"><img alt="gustaf_s" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gustaf_s">gustaf_s</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462153/#Comment_462153" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-19T20:00:31+00:00" title="April 19, 2017  8:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am currently playing in a game.
