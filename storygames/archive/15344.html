We plan to play around 4-5 shorter sessions (around 4 hours each).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players actually managed to blew my mind even before we started playing. As everybody described how his character looked, Lady Blackbird told she was 19. I pointed to the part of her character sheet which says she hadn't seen Uriah Flint for six years and asked 'Uhm, are you sure?' but she just nodded and smiled. I was perpelex for a moment, but then I saw where this was going and thought, yeah, awesome! Uriah as some kind of childhood crush of Lady Blackbird, why not? This gives the story a totally different vibe which I would have never thought of.<br/>\nSo we got a rather young Lady Blackbird, trying to pass as a fisherwomen, protected by a dreadlocked Naomi with a huge scar across her face. A gruffly, bearded Cyrus, a coffee-addicted Kale and a Snargle 'wearing only flap trousers made of rubber and lots of piercings'. Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game started with Kale picking the lock of the cell, Naomi killing one of the guards and Cyrus interogating the other, and then everybordy rushed to get back to the Owl which was just being investigated by the imperial soldiers. After some chaotic scenes, the players managed to win back their ship, Kale started engines, more imperial soldiers arrived in the cargo bay and opened fire on the Owl and everybody exspected Snargle to get them out of here as fast as possible. But to everyones horror, Snargle sayed 'The cargo bay is big enoguh, I fly a turn inside the Hand of Sorrow before we leave!' - which against all odds he managed to do, scattering the imperial troops in panic.<br/>\nAfter some more insane flight stunts, the Owl managed break free while Cyrus used the Owl's cannon to destroy the wirless antenna of the Hand of Sorrow just before it could send a message.<br/>\nSo, with crippled communications, but apart from that pretty much intact, the Hand of Sorrow was left behind while the Owl dived into a nearby asteroid field which was to dangerous for bigger, slower ships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following refreshment scene had much fun bantering between the players, but they didn't really start to talk about their character backgrounds as I had hoped. A few awesome things happened, though.<br/>\nThe first was Lady Black looking into one of the smuggling compartments. I asked Cyrus what she would find there and Cyrus burst out the first thing that came to his mind: "Sausages!" So it was established the the Owl was actually smuggling sausages... I hope to explore the story behind that in the upcoming session!<br/>\nThe second awesome thing happened when Snargle asked me if it was possible to use wireless communication within the remnants. "I don't know", I told him, "you tell me." So Snargle turned back to the other players and told them: "Well, we will have trouble to contact Flint... you see, the problem with the remnants is that wireless communication just isn't reliable there. Messages often are delayed by several days... and sometimes, they arrive several days before they were even sent!"<br/>\nEverybody immediatly loved the idea and the players started to talk about that one captain who tried to divorce one of his three wives who was travelling on another ship, but everything went wrong because the messages arrived in the wrong order. It was a totally confusing and absolutly hilarious story - every time I thought it was finished, another player would jump in and add something like "...so he ended up divorcing her before they were even married!" or "As far as I know, his first and his third wife were actually the same person, but he was married to her twice... at the same time!"<br/>\nAfter this intermezzo, the Owl arrived at Haven where they wanted to buy new fuel. I asked them what was the problem with Haven and the group came up with the harbor master hating goblins which he regarded as filthy and insisted on having them sanitized before allowing them to leave the ship - which made Snargle squeak in terror, obviously it is a rather unpleasant procedure. The players managed to stop the harbor master from searching the ship, but Snargle objected to be sanitized and thus has to stay on board (which I am sure he won't do...).<br/>\nIn the last scene of the evening, I gave a short (and deliberatly vague) describtion of the harbor and the surrounding city. I told them that there was a wild mixture of different people and races on the free world and Cyrus immediatly asked me "Oh, what other races exist besides humans and goblins?" Again, I said "Well,you tell me! What races can you see?" Cyrus immediatly jumped to it, telling "I see many of those horned, purple guys... you know, those who always smile but never say a word. Some say they are enlighted, but I believe they are just idiots."<br/>\n"Oh, no! They are very spiritual and mystical beings indeed!", Snargle contradicted.<br/>\n"Well," Cyrus asked, "if they are that enlighted, how come they never speak a word?"<br/>\n"Because they allready have said everything there is to say... long before there was anybody to listen."<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, how awesome is that? I don't know yet whats up with those purple guys, but this short dialog added a new and intriguing element to the game. At this point, we had to cut. We will continue today and if you're interessted, I'll update this report after each session.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome observations and stuff that didn't work so well:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n* My sister, who played Cyrus, didn't really feel comfortable whe the 'ex-soldier/in command'-part of her character, but apart from that, she had a lot of fun with the role. After the session, we talked about how we could change the character so she'd be more comfortable with it without messing up the whole setup. We ended up discarding the ex-soldier part and instead made him a bastard son of some imperial noble to keep the troubled connection with the empire in the game. Made some minor tweaks to keys &amp; secrets, will see how it works tonight.<br/>\n* I totally need to get used to the system when it comes to action/combat scenes. During the first session, I totally fell into the habit of breaking up the combat in to rounds and giving everyone an action and tried to run the combat like in an traditional RPG - instead of just resolving it with just one or to rolls. This totally didn't work.<br/>\n* Players need more encouragement to bring their own ideas into the story. This was very weird and a bit shocking to observe. I talked about it with my sister afterwards - I knew that for her and most of the other players, Lady Blackbird was actually the kind of game they really wanted to play. In most other games they had played, they were frustrated by not being able to use their imagination more because there was always someone at the table who knew the official setting better than them and would go 'No, you can't do this because...'. They have internalized this mindset of 'I have to be careful not to contradict what is in all those huge books all these geeks seem to know by heart' that they are very shy with bringing their own ideas to the table now that they are allowed to. It got better during the first session and I exspect it to be different allready during the second, but I was really surprised how deep this kind of conditioning went.</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steffen" title="Steffen"><img alt="Steffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steffen">Steffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348465/#Comment_348465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T10:20:34+00:00" title="November  9, 2011 10:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you had an awesome night!

But there were really large segments of the game when the players were rather insecure and not taking the initiative. Another problem was that the amount of participation was very unbalanced. Especially Snargle contributed a lot, but some of the other players were rather shy and passive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said... we played the second session yesterday and it was a totally different and much smoother experience. I was totally blown away! All players were contributing, building on each others ideas and constantly thowing in new crazy stuff. In fact, most of the time I was just playing NPCs and setting obstacles - apart from that, the players were running the game and barely needed me. So I guess everybody (including me) just needed some time to get into the game and now we solved our initial problems and are really into it.<br/>\nI will write a report about the second session later... there is much goodness to share!<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: ccreitz[/cite]If you're willing to share them, it would be fine to show us the changes you made to Cyrus in German.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI will upload and share the entire stuff during the next days. There is still a little work to be done - so far, I only translated those pages the players needed to see, but I want to make a complete translation. (There is allready a german translation out there which I found via google, but it really didn't work for me... a lot of it read rather clumsy, so I decided to do my own.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinB" title="MartinB"><img alt="MartinB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinB">MartinB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348549/#Comment_348549" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T06:05:50+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  6:05AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2011 6:08AM by MartinB.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still, working on the play report (man, a lot happend in that session!), but here is something I observed and thought it may be helpful for others who want to GM the game:<br/>\nWhen you ask the players questions to introduce new elements into the story, don't ask them what or who it <i>is</i>, but ask them to describe what they <i>see</i>.<br/>\nFor example, instead of saying: "You recognize someone you know from your time in prison. Who is it?"<br/>\n- you say: "You recognize someone you know from your time in prison. Describe him, what does he look like?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI observed that (at least in my group) that it makes a big difference and I guess I understand why: If you ask questions like 'who' or 'what', players are forced to think in categories of story and feel pressured to think about what would make sense right now before they start talking - it's a different way of thinking than what do when just playing your character. This sudden shift (change of stance?) feels like an unnatural interruption.<br/>\nOn the other hand, when you ask 'what do you see?', players don't have to change their stance and can continue to describe what their character sees, and they can just start to say whatever comes to their mind first without worrying about what it <i>means</i> - that will come naturally once you have an image in your head:<br/>\n"I see a tall guy, with long dirty hair... cheap clothing, but he's carrying a mean looking dagger... has a strange tatoo on his hand... oh no, he used to be a snitch for the imperial police!."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process is much smoother than leading the players to do it the other way round - thinking about who he is (a snitch for the imperial police) first and then thinking about what he looks like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348554/#Comment_348554" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T06:57:10+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  6:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Martin, I like your suggestion of asking what they see immediately.

The Goblin-hating harbor master didn't allow Snargle to leave the ship and the Owl needed new fuel before it could continue its journey.<br/>\nI tried to get everybody involved right from the beginning this time, so when I narrated the intro to describe the basic situation, I asked every player one question. This worked really well and the answers formed the foundation for the entire session, and I'm definitly planning to use this techique again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Cyrus wether they would be able to afford the needed fuel. Cyrus was skeptical and didn't want to sell the smuggling goods on Haven because he hoped to get a better price elsewhere. Maybe Lady Blackbird would be able to pay for it, but she allready had paid for a lot of other expences.<br/>\nI told Naomi that there was one interessting building in the city beneath them that looked totally different than the rest of the city and asked her to describe it. She told that it was a grey tower which stood isolated on a large square. It was hard to see any details because the building seemed to wobble and waft like shrouded by magic. A long line of people stood before its main gate, waiting to be let in.<br/>\nNext, I ask Kale to describe the skyship that had docked next to the Owl. It was slim and streamlined, painted green, looking very new and modern. It was definitly faster than the Owl, but had inferior weapons. I turned to Lady Blackbird and asked her what she knew about this kind of ship and learned that it was a new class of imperial courier ship. It couldn't know anything about them (since the Hand of Sorrows communication systems had been crippled during the escape of the Owl), but its presence still was something to be concerned about.<br/>\nFinaly, I asked Snargle why, from all the citys on Haven, he had chosen to fly to one where the harbor master hated goblins. Snargle replied that this place was famous for its mouflon races. Not only could you make (or loose) a lot of money by betting on the mouflons, but for some weird political reasons, the fuel prices somehow interacted with the races and that meant you could get fuel to a lower price than anywhere else on Haven - if you were lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this five questions, everybody had contributed and we had gone from nothing to an intriguing setup. So the session started with the players discussing their plans. Obviously, they had to manipulate a mouflon race to get the fuel prices down and win some cash. Snargle explained that a special black bretzel was used drive the mouflons, and they would have to get their hands on it to manipulate the race. As exspected, Snargle didn't want to stay on board, so he disguised himself as 'a monk of the wobbling tower' to fool the harbor master. The rest of the crew was highly skeptical about this idea (since it obviously wasn't the first time that Snargle tried to fool the harbor master, and usually he failed) and only reluctantly agreed to give it a try, which led to some great dialogs:<br/>\nCyrus: "Okay, Snargle.... but this time, please don't sing the <i>I-am-not-a-goblin</i>-song!"<br/>\nSnargle: "But may I remind you that the last time, it was <i>you</i> who sang that song."<br/>\nCyrus: "But I <b>am</b> not a goblin!"<br/>\nKale: "Yeah... but noone believed you."<br/>\nAgainst all odds, Snargle managed to fool the harbor master this time and the party went into the city. Lady Blackbird, who had enough of Kales cooking skills ("I don't need a pan to make pancakes, some parts of the engine get so hot that you can just apply the dough to it and scratch it off when it's done.") trailed of with Naomi to get some decent food while the others started their quest for the brezel. As it turned out, the brezel was still in the wobbling tower - you see, the monks of the wobbling tower guarded the secret of making this special black brezel you need to drive the mouflons. Haven has a strange economy indeed.<br/>\nSnargle, still in the disguise of a monk, went to the towers back door and managed to swindle his way inside.<br/>\nNaomi and Lady Blackbird observed the scene while having lunch at a nearby restaurant. As soon as Snargle had vanished into the tower, I told Naomi: "...and it seems like someone else has recognized that this wasn't a real monk. You recognize the person from your time in prison! Is this good or bad news?" - "Bad news! He used to be a snitch for the Empire!" And now he was talking to the monks and warning them.<br/>\nLady Blackbird and Naomi rushed to help Snargle, but since they didn't look like monks at all, they couldn't take the back door - and as Naomi observed, there was still a long long line of tourists at the front gate, waiting to visit the tower. Which led to Lady Blackbirds best line of the evening:<br/>\n"Standing in line? Oh, I've never done that! How does one do this?"<br/>\nWhile the two of them talked their way into the temple, word was spreading among the monks that a goblin imposter was among them. Snargle did his best to convince everyone that the abbot was the goblin and he was the real abbot, but he was slowly running out of luck (and pool dice). At the last moment, Lady Blackbird and Naomi arrived to save Snargle from the angry monks. The trio managed to manipulate the black bretzel and then hurried to escape the tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, the snitch had talked to the imperial courier from the green ship and the courier now started to hire some mercenaries to surround the tower and catch Lady Blackbird as soon as she stepped out. But Cyrus and Kale became aware of the threat and with some quick talking and a darkness spell from Kale, they manage to distract the mercenaries long enough, so everybody managed to escape unnoticed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reunited group decided to go right to the mouflon spiral [2] and blend into the gathering crowd. For now, they were save and could enjoy the race. Since the manipulated the whole thing, Kale decided to bet all his remaining valueables. But in spite of Snargles schemes, Kale had to use a jump spell to make sure that the right mouflon really won. Hooray! Fuel prices fell to an all-time low and Kale won a pile of money.<br/>\nBut Snargle got nervous: "You used <i>magic</i> to cheat at a mouflon race? Are you insane? The Protectors will find out! We better get that fuel and leave Haven as fast as possible!" So they rushed back to the Owl, exspecting to find it sorrounded by mercenaries or imperial troops because of their trouble at the wobbling tower. But to their surprise, no sign of the enemy... and the imperial courier ship was gone, too!<br/>\nNaomi and Cyrus got suspicious and started to search the ship for signs of manipulation while the rest of the crew refilled the fuel tanks of the Owl. One last time for the session, I told the players that it was up to them to define what they found.<br/>\n"Dead mice in the turbines?" Cyrus sounded disappointed. "Dead mice to clog my engines and make it look like an accident? That is all they could come up with? Did they really exspect me to fall for this old trick?"<br/>\nNaomi, in the meantime, found something far more troubling: Somebody had scratched a sign into the the Owl's hull: "I know that symbol from my time fighting in the arena. Means something like <i>'I'm watching you.'</i> They <i>wanted</i> us to get away. And they want us to know."<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of getting away... the Protectors by now had found out about the manipulated race and followed the magic to its source, so an angry mob of all those who had lost their money on the race (and some monks) was approaching the now refueled Owl, which made a quick start and once more took off into the wild blue yonder...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] Because this is obviously the way harbors for skyships work.<br/>\n[2] Mouflon races take place on spiral-shaped tracks which get steeper and steeper with each turn. So the whole racing track looks like a tower: The mouflons start on top, and frightend by the black bretzel, they start to run down the outward-spiraling track which finally gets so steep that the mouflons will sooner or later stumble and roll into the finishing line, which is part of the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348606/#Comment_348606" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T15:07:07+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  3:07PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348643/#Comment_348643" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T00:26:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2011 12:26AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wonderful!

So for them, I hoped it would be the thing they were always looking for and seems like I was right. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br><br>*<i>Das schwarze Auge</i>, biggest traditional german fantasy game.

Lady Blackbird tells the GM "Listen &amp; Ask Questions,<i> Don't Plan</i>", so I'll try to think about tomorrow session without planing. Since I need to take some notes anyway, I may as well do it here so you can see my thought-process before the game and compare it to the after-action-report.<br><br>So, last session was pretty much a self-contained chapter in our larger adventure, with its own setup (resulting from the arrival on Haven and the answers to the 5 initial questions), conflict (all the weird stuff that happend)  and ending (the Owl, now refilled, taking off into the blue again).<br>So we can go into the new session with a nice clean start. Since we pretty much ended with action and low dice-pools, it will be natural to start with a refreshment scene and the players need to talk about where they want to go next anyway - Nightport seems a likely candidate, but who knows...<br><br>No plans then... but two goals:<br><br>1. Some of the cool stuff the players made up during the first two sessions has not really been resolved and has the potential to play a larger roll in the story. So I want to bring them up again or, better, encourage the players to bring them up again themselfes.<br> - The temporal communication anomalies in the remnants. What is the trick to avoid them?<br> - The purple guys. What is the matter with them?<br> - Contraband sausages?!<br> - The snitch Naomi knows from prison - who is he?<br> - Who left the mark on the Owls hull and why?<br> - Lady Blackbirds has a mysterious amulet which seems to mean a lot to her - what is that about?<br>Hm, just formulating these open points actually made me aware of two things:<br> a) It's probably too much to try to bring all of this back into the story, so I shouldn't pressure myself and/or the players to do so. If just two or three of these elements turn up again, it will be fine.<br> b) It took some restrain to write it down as open questions, for some of them have 'obvious' answers (the amulet is from Uriah Flint, the snitch left the mark...). But I should leave them open for now, so the players have the opportunity to take them into different directions if they want to.<br><br>2. I hope for some more exploration of character backgrounds.<br>Everybody is aware that 'Natasha' is definitly not the common fisher woman she claims to be, but nobody seemed to interessted to learn who she really is. And the ohter character backgrounds haven't been questioned or reveald much either. I would love to learn more about that and I think it would really give the game more depth if we'd get into this stuff... where did Naomi get her scar, how did Lady Blackbird meet Uriah Flint, how did she end up hiring the Owl etc.<br>I really wish to hear the players talk about this, but I don't want to force them. Not sure about what I can do to encourage them without being to blunt.<br><br>Since the 'ask everyone a question during the intro'-technique worked so well the last time, I'll do this again. Since they haven't really talked about where the Owl should fly next, I may try to ask some questions which will feed right into the upcoming discussion and tie in the character backgrounds:<br>For example: "Lady Blackbird, what will Count Carlowe do when he learns you've been seen on Haven?"<br><br>...enough preparation for now, don't want to overthink this.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349000/#Comment_349000" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T18:43:10+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  6:43PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Martin,<br><br>That sounds like great prep.

The message was send by a certain imperial courier ship, and thus Hollas learned that Lady Blackbird has been seen by a snitch on Haven and that she joined the crew of the Owl. "We had her right here! Damned! We had her right here and we let her get away! We must inform Count Carlowe immediatly!"<br>At this point, I turned to Lady Blackbird and asked her: "So... what will Count Carlowe do if he hears you've been spotted on Haven?" - "He will most certainly loose his temper - without me and the marriage, his dynasty is doomed. And maybe he now is convinced that the imperial troops are to incompetent and he has to try... other ways... to catch me."<br>Switching back to the Owl which just had left Haven in the general direction of Nightport, I asked Snargle what he was looking out for when taking the Owl into this territory. After a quick look on the map, Snargle explained that they now were getting closer to the sun and thus they had to exspect more solar winds and magnetic storms with strange side effects. He had heard that there were people living on the bright side of Nightport, too, and that they had been changed in strange ways by the constant exposure to the sun. Next I asked Cyrus what his experiences with Nightport were like. "Great! You have to be careful to follow all the weird rules of the pirates... they have a lot of strict and obscure rituals about what and how much you have to drink during certain songs and when dancing on the table is mandatory and this kind of stuff... if you screw it up, you're in trouble, but when you drink correctly, you can have a pretty fun time there!" Naomi, however, disagreed: "Although the Empire officially treats Nightport as an enemy, there is lot of unofficial trade going on... this is where my parents where sold into slavery!"<br>In the meantime, Kale was busy looking through all the stuff he won at the mufflon race. I told him that among all the money and the jewlery, there was one object he'd never seen before and asked him to describe it. It turned out to be an elliptic piece of dark metal, with a grip on one end and some strange spikes on the other, emitting a soft humming noise. He had no clue what to do with it. (And at this time, neither had I!)<br><br>Now, after everybody had contributed to the intro of the session, the game itself began with the players discussing their next steps and I could lean back for a while and just listen and enjoy the conversation. Everybody quickly agreed that they should go to Nightport, where the hoped to learn how to navigate the remnants and how to contact Uriah Flint. But as they were trying to figure out the details, the players finally started to question each other about their character backgrounds and it turned into quite an interessting talk... some interessting bits:<br> - Lady Blackbirds coverstory had worn rather thin and she finally admited that she was no fisherwoman, but from a noble family, though she didn't tell her name yet. As the others called into question wether she was serious about marrying the pirate king, and wether Uriah would really stick to the engagement, she got quite upset and exclaimed "I know him since I was three, and he is an honorable man!"<br> - There was quite an interessting dynamic between Cyrus and the Lady going on in this scene. Cyrus had bought of the Key of Hidden Longing early in the game and he and the Lady didn't get along to well. Now, as he learned about Blackbirds trouble with the imperial nobility, they suddenly had something in common.<br> - At one point, Naomi told the Owls crew "You can't be good at what you're doing, else you wouldn't be smuggling sausages!" Kale and Cyrus reacted with pure comedy gold, at first all out denying that they were smuggling anything at all, then denying that they were smuggling then sausages, then admitting that "the best stuff to smuggle is something you can eat in case you mess up finding a buyer." And finally, we learned that the prices for sausages have gone up dramatically since the empire introduced the 'Wurstgenu\xdfsteuer'. [1]<br> - Snargle insisted on going to the bright side of Nightport, hoping to learn something from the strange people living there. According to him, prolonged exposure to the sun changes beings in strange ways and gives them mystical powers. The goblins call the gift of shape warping the 'gift of the sun' - they haven't always been this way, but the goblins homeworld was the closest world to the sun and so they were changed. But the goblin homeworld was to close and finally crashed into the sun...<br> In spite of this fascinating story, Snargle couldn't convince the others. (Lady Blackbird: "Are you saying that if I get to close to the sun, I might change into something like you?! No way!")<br><br>When the conversation started to slow down, I decided that now would be the right time for me to jump back into the game and throw some stuff at them. An idea had emerged in my head for an action scene which would hit several keys and some of the topics previously discussed.<br>So I announced a sudden beeping sound from the cockpit as the sensors had deteced another ship near the Owl. Shortly thereafter, a distress signal from the other ship (The 'Pride of Myr') came in through the wireless, but it was badly distorted due to solar winds and most of it was unintelligibly. The players decided to investigate and soon discovered a medium-sized trading vessel under attack from a sky squid which was slowly pulling it down into the lower depths. Some flying and shooting later, the squid-problem was solved, but as they got a closer look at the trading vessel, Naomi discovered that it was build to transport living cargo... slaves!<br>Naturally, Naomi wanted to board the ship and free the slaves. Cyrus strongly agreed, Lady Blackbird and Kale were okay with it, only Snargle didn't look to happy about the upcoming fight but went along with it anyway. Under the pretense of helping them to fix their engines (which had been damaged by the sky squid), the players talked the Pride of Myr into letting them on board. Snargle stayed on the Owl to keep it alongside the larger vessel and the other four started to subdue the crew of the Pride, consisting of the slave trader and some imperial guards. There was the most creepy moment in the entire game so far when I asked Naomi what she was going to do with one guard they just had captured. With a sweet smile and a soft voice, she answered: "I'm going to traumatize him for the rest of his life."<br>And there was a tense situation when they encountered the lieutenant who was commanding the guards - instead of opening fire, he saluted to Lady Blackbird since he recognized her from a ball on Illysium. After a short moment of hesitation and confusion, Blackbird decided to take advantage of the situation and help Naomi to cut the guards down (not that she needed much help...)<br>After the fight was won, Kale went to plunder the captains cabin, while the rest freed the slaves. Most of them were ordinary folks, but Cyrus spotted a strange group of red-skinned, green haired people who spoke a strange language and stayed among themselves. I quickly decided that they were 'sunfolk' from the bright side of Nightport. Kale in the meantime found several maps which showed the Imperium has recently been very busy charting and exploring the space near the remnants.<br><br>While the players were still trying to figure out what to do next, another message came in through the wireless: "Pride of Myr, this is the Hand of Sorrow. We recieved your distress signal and are moving in to assist."<br/>Everyone suddenly moved very fast. The former slaves were left in charge of the Pride of Myr and fled with top speed - luckily, Kale had allready repaired the engines. The Owl, however, took the sunfolk onboard with the intention to bring them back to nightport. And, to my surprise, Naomi had spared the live of Mica, the youngest of the imperial guards (who didn't seem too happy with his job) and took him along, hoping to bring him over to their side. (Can't wait to learn how this turns out!)<br/><br/>The Owl fled through the lower depths and manage to escape the Hand of Sorrow once more and soon, the crew tried to talk with the sunfolk. With Blackbirds magic and Snargles knowledge of languages, they managed to get a shaky communication going. The sunfolk were thankful for being freed and shared some of their knowledge of solar winds and anomalies... to navigate them, you need a special device called a Kytte-Kathai. The sunfolk decribed what such a device looked like - it was the strange object Kale had found at the beginning of the session among the stuff he won on Haven.<br/>Kale hadn't been in the scene and thus didn't hear the news. Kales player gleefully anounced "Meanwhile, I figured out what to do with this strange thing - I bolted it to a wall and with all the strange spikes, it's handy to keep my tools organized."<br/><br/>At this point, we had to cut and will continue next session with the arrival at Nightport.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] Which means as much as 'tax for sausage indulgence', but it just sounds so much better in german.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349924/#Comment_349924" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T11:06:03+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 11:06AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic!<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying the creativity you and the players are all bringing onboard.

I didn't really realize how much had been going on in the last session until I started to write it down...<br/><br/>Today we will play the next session. The way last session ended, I didn't have to do much thinking and preparing this time - the ingredientes from the previous sessions are all there and should come together quite naturally:<br/>The Players allready have a Kytte-Kathai, but so far no idea how to use it and thats what they have to learn on Nightport. After what we learned so far, the pirates on the dark side of Nightport are quite a strange and complex society - on the one hand, Cyrus made it sound like jolly Monkey Island-style pirates, but from Naomi we learned that there is a much darker side to it. This is a theme I want to explore further.<br/>And since Lady Blackbird raised the stakes during the last intro ("without the marriage, Count Carlowes dynasty is doomed"), Carlowes henchmen will be after them. An imperial assault on Nightport seems unlikely, so it will be bounty hunters or the like - which should be a good opportunity to tie Naomis background (the Snitch etc) back in.<br/><br/>I find the fact that Naomi took Mica along highly fascinating and will use it as a starting point, narrating the intro from his point of view: How he joined the imperial army with dreams of honor and glory and soon got disillusioned when he found himself guarding slaves. Now, he has been 'freed', but isn't really that convinced that the rebels are any better... and they seem to be on what looks to him like a suicide mission. So poor Mica has no real glue what to do next, as the Owl is approaching Nightport.<br/><br/>These are my main ideas for the upcoming session. Another idea that I might throw in when an opportunity arises are the puprle guys from session one: Maybe they are what became of those goblins who were still on their homeworld as it fell into the sun? We'll see...!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scramble" title="scramble"><img alt="scramble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scramble">scramble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350017/#Comment_350017" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T06:35:42+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  6:35AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The slave-ship is such a classic it deserves to be in the orginal LB PDF.

And then let Naomi explain why she, of all people, is defending her. But the way the session developed, I had to cut it. Maybe you can use it in your session. ;-)<br/><br/>Of all the good stuff that John put in Lady Blackbird, I really find Naomis role among the most interessting. Why is the former slave now loyal to an imperial noble, and how deep is her loyality really? It takes just two sentences to set it all up, but it creates an awesome tension and is so open for all kinds of different storys and outcomes... fantastic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinB" title="MartinB"><img alt="MartinB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinB">MartinB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350819/#Comment_350819" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T14:54:26+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  2:54PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Steffen,<br/><br/>das Angebot nehme ich gerne an!

I guess there is some consensus that they want to get in trouble because they want to have an adventure, after all.<br/>It also serves as a kind of auto-balancing mechanic, because I noted that the players tend to self-complicate things for the first half of the session until they reach the level of complication they are comfortabe with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinB" title="MartinB"><img alt="MartinB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinB">MartinB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351403/#Comment_351403" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T15:01:19+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  3:01PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2011 6:26AM by MartinB.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... I've been lazy, time to update my session report.<br/>Our fourth session has been a bit short since Kale was caught up in a traffic jam, so it was rather late when we finally started.<br/><br/>We started right where we had left of, with the Owl approaching Nightport and my usual round of questions.<br/>Cyrus told us about some of his contacts on Nightport: There's 'Limping Mike', who runs a quite popular tavern, and Gregor, a pirate who is some distant relative of Uriah Flint and runs buisness for him on Nightport.<br/>I turned to Kale and asked him: "...and what did you steal from Gregor the last time you saw him?"<br/>Turns out, Gregor is terribly superstituos and Kale stole his favourite lucky charm... Gregor has been rather nervous and paranoid ever since.<br/>Naomi talked a bit more about the darker side of Nightport: Though she never has been there herself, her parents where sold into slavery by a guy simpley called 'One-Eye' for obvious reasons.<br/>And Lady Blackbird finally revealed that she was supposed to meet a certain Oscar to get in contact with Uriah. In the meantime, Snargle was listening to the radio chatter. There were rumors going on that the sunfolk was planning an invasion of the dark side!<br/><br/>Play began with the party splitting up - Naomi and Lady Blackbird (and Mica!) went to meet with Oscar, while the rest of the crew went to Limping Mike. Both groups had multiple random encounters with pirates and their arcane drinking rituals which had to be obeyed, so we quickly decided that we should add the condition 'drunk' to the charactersheets...<br/><br/>At Limping Mikes, there was lots of chatter about the sunfolk and the players were rather shocked about the hysteria and hostillity towards the sunfolk. Limping Mike agreed that it was bullshit and just a false pretense made up by the slave traders to justify further hunting and enslaving the sunfolk. Kale and Cyrus were quite upset by the situation - the slave traders have been growing more and more influential during the last years, the good old days are gone. Back then, Uriah keept the slave traders in check, but since Uriah hasn't left the remnants for several years (a fact that had been established in a previous session), things have spun out of control on Nightport.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Lady Blackbird and Naomi (after some shopping, drinking and bullying Mica) managed to make contact with Oscar. He told them that something had gone wrong - somebody should have met them on Haven and give them the Kytte-Kathai needed to navigate the remnants, but the courier turned out to be less reliable as exspected and lost the Kytte-Kathai while gambling on mufflons races. Lady Blackbird gathered that the Kytte-Kathai must be the strange thing Kale won on Haven, so that turned out well - but since they hadn't been handling it correctly, they'd need to reallign it before they could use it. There had recently been a growing interest in these devices, probably related to the increased imperial activity around the remnants.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at Limbing Mikes an old, grim one-eyed pirate captain showed up an started to further incite the crowd against the sunfolk - he seemed to be the one behind the hysteria. Cyrus couldn't keep his mouth shut, and for a moment it seemed like the situatin would escalate, but they somehow managed to talk their way out and meet with the others. Naomi draw the conclusion that the one-eyed pirate must obviously be the guy who sold her parents into slavery - but he had to much support here even for Naomi to make starting a fight look like a good idea.<br/>The situation was further complicated by the fact that they still had the sunfolk they had freed on the Pride of Myr hidden on the Owl and feared what would happen if that would be detected. The group decided that the next step should be to return them to the bright sight and let them realign the Kytte-Kathai. But first they wanted to visit Gregor to see if he had some news.<br/>Gregor was alone on his ship - the crew had allready left it when they reached Nightport a couple of days ago, but for superstitous reasons, Gregor always waited for seven days before leaving the ship, but he agreed to let them on board. They talked to him for a while and learned that Uriah was busy planning something really really big, but noone knew what exactly it was. But it seemed important enough to him to ignore Nightport for a while and let things there go to hell - a situation many of the pirates once loyal to him where unhappy about. Gregor himself had been mostly busy chasing off imperial ships which got to close to his hideout and hasn't therefore spend much time on Nightport.<br/><br/><br/><br/>...unfortunatly, we had to cut at this point. The session was short, but a lot of the big picture came together this time. Another hilarious detail of this session was that Cyrus asked Gregor if Uriah was still wearing 'that ridicolous hat', which immediatly became a canonical item and running gag, very much to Lady Blackbirds displeasure. Will continue the game tomorrow!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Regina%20Hart" title="Regina Hart"><img alt="Regina Hart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.reginahart.net/ganesha32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Regina%20Hart">Regina Hart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354199/#Comment_354199" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T18:35:47+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  6:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Martin, thank you so much for taking the time to share your Lady Blackbird sessions.
