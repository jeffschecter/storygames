Monte should be familiar to D&amp;D fans for his work on the Planescape campaign setting, Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil, Arcana Unearthed, the mammoth Ptolus city sourcebook, and, of course, Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition.<br/><br/>I've spent the past several months talking about D&amp;D's past and how that relates to its future. It's now time to focus much more on the future of the game. Monte has an unmatched design pedigree in the RPG field, and for that reason we've brought him on board to work with R&amp;D in making D&amp;D the greatest RPG the world has seen. Over the next few weeks, Monte will use this column to share his thoughts about the game. As we look to chart D&amp;D's future course, this column will continue to be a place where we share our ideas and listen to yours, and we hope you'll keep reading, discussing the contents, and sharing your feedback and thoughts with us and the larger D&amp;D community. That's what makes Legends &amp; Lore a conversation that we can all participate in.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343459/#Comment_343459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T06:05:03+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  6:05AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 6:05AM by jenskot.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Starting this thread on request.

I mean, Monte seems like a very nice guy, and I'm fond of his cool weird setting work he's done, but at the same time he's basically responsible for every single thing about D&amp;D 3e that I find problematic. The super powered wizards, it's utter lack of decent advise for running the game, and to a lesser degree the whole Ivory Tower game design thing (although he recognized that as a problem ages ago, so this probably wouldn't be a problem again).<br/><br/>I was hoping they'd hire some more fresh-faced individual with crazy ideas, or one of the nifty OSR folks.<br/><br/>4e now doomed to be a dead-end in the D&amp;D evolutionary line, it seems.

The thing that gets me over and over about Wizards (other companies too, but especially WotC) is that they don't know how to design pre-packaged dungeon adventures that are super awesome the first time you sit down and run them, which seems to be, like, the core of what D&amp;D should be about. How else do you show DMs how to run the game?  Keep on the Shadowfell was a HUGE disappointment, and it was most people's introduction to 4E.  I don't know if it's the "design by committee" aspects which keep weakening their approach (see: skill challenges), but it seems like it shouldn't be that hard to make the most definitive part of D&amp;D (dungeon adventures) super exciting, if that's the focus of your job.<br/><br/>Also some really top-notch, concrete instructions on how to run the game would also be a vast improvement on previous editions. If they bother to look at stuff like Dogs in the Vineyard, Mouse Guard, Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, etc., they'll see that the standards for giving people the tools and advice they need to run games is vastly improved now and it's about time that D&amp;D recognized this as well.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's kinda out of their hands now, if they can't get it to work this time.  Pathfinder and the OSR and Dungeon World and other things will continue to keep on keeping on.  The best that D&amp;D will do for people already playing other games is give them another option to consider when planning a new campaign.  I think it's total dominance of the dungeon-y part of the hobby may be permanently gone, unless they really do hit this one out of the park.  But maybe the pressure will be good for them, though, and push them to be better, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343465/#Comment_343465" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T07:49:41+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  7:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Cam takes an unremarkable universal game system, adds indie designers, and ends up with some pretty remarkable games. WotC takes the oldest RPG around, pushes it in some interesting directions for a while, then brings back one of the main guys who made a previous edition what it was with the hopes of -- what, getting rid of those "interesting directions," maybe? MWP feels like it's been expanding, creatively; is WotC going to start <i>contracting</i>? Has someone decided 4E was an "experiment"?<br/><br/>Very curious to see how it shakes it, nonetheless. I rarely play D&amp;D these days (and not out of choice, either), but I'm always interested to see what WotC does with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343469/#Comment_343469" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T08:26:30+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  8:26AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it funny that everything Wizards keeps saying in their columns kinda points to a 5th edition(of a sorts; either way, the next iteration of the rules) and it's causing wild speculation among the fan base, yet Wizards has more or less left them to it. With Essentials, they were constantly insisting "This is definitely NOT 4.5e, seriously, stop calling it that," but they're just letting the 5e rumors grow and grow. I don't know what they're planning, I just think it's kind of interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed with J. Walton on all accounts. Pre-done adventures are pretty lame to me(Never been able to run one of Wizards' adventures, but it might not JUST be them).<br/>\nI think it's good that D&amp;D becoming more on the level with other games, becoming an alternative as opposed to being the standard. It shows not just the dropping status of D&amp;D but also(probably more of) the rising interest in the story game mentality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking forward to seeing what Monte does with Legends &amp; Lore. I enjoyed what Mearls did with the column, I think he was very consistently bringing up new ideas and starting good discussions, and I hope Monte will be able to do the same. But we'll see next week I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343473/#Comment_343473" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T08:40:13+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  8:40AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wizards success is good for all roleplaying so I hope they get their groove back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343482/#Comment_343482" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T09:30:34+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  9:30AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 9:30AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's impossible to do a "single version" of D&amp;D that will satisfy people who like one or two editions exclusively.

There's no single version of D&amp;D; that's going to placate the entirety of the fanbase, though I think Jenskot's "pick and choose" approach would probably be the most crowd-pleasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with pre-published adventures is that there's probably some economic reason why they've gotta be 30-60 pages long.  The trouble is, a night's entertainment is <i>maybe</i> 2 pages long at most.  (The One-Page Dungeon contests are brilliant and give you almost everything you want.)  So those extra 28-58 pages are either<br/>\n<br/>\n* stuff that is necessary to the adventure, so it will take months to run (and means each module destroys part of the market for other modules)<br/>\n* more game stuff than you will ever need (so it's all wasted design work)<br/>\n* super-elaborate GM-controls-the-plot type stuff about the backstory for the last 4000 years of the setting<br/>\n* all kinds of details that get in the way of developing the confidence to improvise<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole published-module approach in the '80's, I think, really ingrained a lot of bad GM'ing habits, <i>just because of the publishing format</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 or 2 page downloads are much better, but apparently harder to monetize.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just hope that whenever they release 5e, they make the older editions legally downloadable again.

So if someone wants to have all the rules in writing, they need all of those.<br/><br/>Of course, if they continue to make all their crunch available to subscribers through their web apps, then that alleviates the "gotta buy em all" problem a little. Of course, in return for not having to buy every book, you have to fork over $15/month for ever and ever amen.<br/><br/>But that's the whole idea, right? To figure out how they can have a continuous revenue stream so they can make all that money they need for hookers and blow.<br/><br/>Personally, I like that a typical module has enough content in it for like 20 to 40 hours of game time. It's much easier to peel out a small subsection of it if that's all I want then it is to write my own stuff to expand on what's there. If I just wanted to make up my own stuff, I wouldn't be buying a module, right?<br/><br/>And besides, as long as they keep their licensing semi-open, there will continue to be dozens and dozens and dozens of external contributors ready to write and sell modules of various sizes. And that benefits both Wizards and the individual writer.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much it helps the consumer.

That's a fairly big niche. <br/><br/>The only fantasy-based products with comprable exposure are World of Warcraft, the Lord of the Rings books/movies, and the Harry Potter books/movies.<br/><br/>Their current model relies heavily on software to supplement their core rulebooks - the character builder, monster builder, etc. Not to mention the subscription fees that go along with that, which the vast majority of 4e players seem willing to pay. That's fairly good modern-style implementation for a game with 30 years of a book-publication-based revenue model.<br/><br/>Plus, there's dozens and dozens of community based resources demonstrating concepts through video, podcasts, blogs, etc.<br/><br/>No other RPG has nearly that level of both company-based and community-based support.<br/><br/>And, honestly, I don't think you can solve any of the biggest issues with D&amp;D without gutting it to the point where there will be even more community outcry than was seen with 3e and 4e.<br/><br/>Just about anything that one group would want to FIX, another group would want to KEEP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343541/#Comment_343541" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T17:59:43+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  5:59PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 6:01PM by TylerT.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The computer implementation does not target the people who routinely gather around a table to play games*, namely board gamers. it's like replacing a scroll with a codex when everyone is using touch pads.<br/><br/>I can present to you a completely working model of DnD 3.5 with what I'm talking about implemented. From player experience to product structure.<br/><br/>The biggest thing to understand about my argument is there is no reason to leave anything behind. The things people love can be folded into new and better presentations. but there is no reason the old presentations can not also exist.<br/><br/>Many people here argue that games like DnD are too complex to be played easily, that misses the mark. a game like DnD is hard to absorb because of how the information is presented. DnD actually needs MORE rules not less. but in order for players to absorb and use those concepts there needs to be a major shift in how information is presented. it's critical to understand that in the board game population one person at every table may have read the rule book. board game rule books are free because they have very little value as products.<br/><br/>With more rules bandwidth DnD could add the kinds of structures it needs to be relevant to modern life. things that control game length and remove the need for prep. note these things could easily be ignored by heritage groups and consumers and in fact given rule books don't have enough bandwidth for them anyway they can be left out of classic presentations.<br/><br/>*it ignores the need for at the table character creation, requires a printer and card cutting. from what i understand the red box made an effort towards resolving this. it's also a strange new purchase model for table top players but that's neither here nor there, it's cool to try new things.

But CRPGs and MMORPGS are huge among nerds.  Boardgames are becoming embraced by a larger and larger segment of the population, even those who aren't deeply nerds.  So delivering a boardgame that brings the feel of a CCRPG/MMORPG to the table top in a fun high production value I suspect seems MUCH more palatable to Hasbro game execs then another edition of super nerdy books.<br/><br/>If the sales numbers of those games are there...I wouldn't be surprised to learn that those are essentially beta test beds for what "5th edition" will look like.  Dump the Weird RPG books altogether and just release a series of related board games with streamlined tactics, handwaved character interaction and plot, and focus on what most people (outside of us) consider to be the foundation of all roleplaying...leveling up and getting new upgrades.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343711/#Comment_343711" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T07:12:48+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  7:12AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually prepping to start a Pathfinder AP (The Council of Thieves) for my group, and while there's a lot of really great stuff in there, it's WAY too much text and detail - the whole point of using pre-generated adventures is to reduce prep time, but these take just as long. You basically need to read it and then write your own short-form notes for actually running the game. :/ Pretty railroady, too, although this particular one is set in a city so there's room for improvised exploration and personal sidequests.

I need to correct you.  We have had some long time staff leave, a couple of people, but we haven\u2019t reduced the overall number of people working on D&amp;D.  We are constantly adjusting and tweaking our organization.  I think that any healthy organization has some amount of movement.  With Dungeons &amp; Dragons, because of that direct personal relationship that our staff has with the gaming community, our ultimate customers, when someone changes it\u2019s far more noticeable than it is in many other businesses.  But, I can tell you that in my 20 years of management experience I don\u2019t think that I have seen an organization more stable over a period of 15 years than we have had in Wizards of the Coast or D&amp;D.  You take the average tenure of our employees working on D&amp;D and it\u2019s extremely high.  We will have and have had occasional turnover, but D&amp;D is a healthy, thriving business on the role-playing side and will continue to be.<br/><br/>We are always looking at our releases trying to time them out and making sure we are putting out the optimal amount of content, which is a balance between our hardest core fans that could never get enough, and our newer fans who are trying to get involved in the property but can\u2019t be overwhelmed by having too much information or feel like they can\u2019t keep up.  So our programs on D&amp;D are designed to optimize that balance of keeping our most faithful fans happy and be able at the same time to bring in new fans to the property.  And that\u2019s how we are working on our release schedule.<br/><br/>I will also say that our release schedule is related to what we were talking about earlier: trying to drive people into the stores to play D&amp;D and of course while they are there, purchase some D&amp;D products.  That\u2019s the optimal balance we are trying to hit with our program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>the board game side of our business has been very successful, but we want to be careful that we don\u2019t over saturate the market with the D&amp;D board games, so we are constantly on the lookout for (just as we side on the RPG side) what is the optimal balance of the number of releases.  We have been very satisfied with the releases we have had and we will continue to have board games releases in the future but we will do it in a measured way and not try to overstep success and keep the market excited and interested for all the next products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Wizards business will continue to operate as an independent wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro, so the consolidation of the gaming business of Hasbro from Massachusetts to Rhode Island won\u2019t have any direct impact on our business.  However, we have always had a very close relationship with Hasbro to find ways to take advantage of opportunities where they can help us or we can help them, and in the new gaming situation in Rhode Island that will continue to happen. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343723/#Comment_343723" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T08:57:55+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  8:57AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so there seem to be several themes running through this thread...<br/><br/>*Monte Cook: I don't really care for this announcement one way or another. Monte has a reputation but I was never overly impressed or influenced by any of his work. He's in a different space. I think his Ivory Tower days are over so I'm not worried about how that will affect future D&amp;D, but I could be.<br/><br/>*Published Adventures: I belong to the school of thought that say all published adventures suck forever. Ok, most of them. Paizo's Adventure Paths were (are?) a big hit but these days I'm seeing more criticism than praise and from the ones that I checked out yeah, they were the classical overly-wordy, railroading, you-are-going-to-spend-more-time-reading-this-than-you-would-spend-prepping-your-own-game deals. In a word: blah. It has always confused me how the official stance was always "don't railroad" but then the published adventures teach precisely that.<br/><br/>However, I think Wizards is wising up on this, and perhaps faster than Paizo. Check out <i>The Madness at Gardmore Abbey</i>! 1) the focus is on the artefact (boxed set, tokens, flipmaps, dungeon tiles, a DECK OF MANY THINGS) 2) from what I hear it has a number of pregenerated characters with actual dillemas and "Beliefs"/"Bangs" partially incorporated in them 3) it appears to be pretty open and malleable instead of the standard A-B-C plot hackfest.<br/><br/>*5th Edition: I don't think we'll see an actual 5th edition in the sense of the shift from 3e to 4e or 2e to 3e. It's D&amp;D's anniversary in two years and I'm 100% confident that WotC will have a new iteration of the game out for that, but I'm not expecting an overhaul. Merely a drifting/retooling/modulating of 4E, probably with a new marketing strategy and presentation. From Mearls' recent writing I'd guess they want to make a very basic and open version of 4E (reminiscent of the old Basic D&amp;D), with all the increasingly complex and tactical subsystems being modular plugins. But it won't be a new game imo. Also probably repackaged in a box again, as a game, with more internet support for various tools (the character builder seems to be going well). Also, the in-store Encounters and Lair Assault will continue to be the primary outlet for most supported D&amp;D play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344096/#Comment_344096" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T06:54:04+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  6:54AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My one real question.

But it would be interesting to see, yeah...I think what they would need for a new RPG would be a big, interesting, popular licence. I'm not sure they'd dedicate any resources to it otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344100/#Comment_344100" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T07:07:44+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  7:07AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2011 7:08AM by thadrine.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WotC comes out with all of these high quality products and have the largest production team and capital in the industry (at least for RPGs) and yet they have not made anything that "I" would buy in a very long time.

The sub-textual fear is that this change is heading back into a 3.x mindset, which for a lot of 4e fans is a dark, frightening place, full of enemies (i.e. Pathfinder fans).<br><br>It sounds like Monte hasn't actually read or played 4e yet, which is mildly disturbing I do agree.<br/><br/>However, it has to be remembered that Monte doesn't even have a title in his new role and so far his job seems to be to basically noodle around and share his ideas in Legends &amp; Lore, so all the sturm and drang is way overblown.  It's as if the janitor at WotC ruminated that Wizards should be more powerful in 4e.  I do think the reaction demonstrates a very real fear that 4e is not doing well and may not be around for long.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344133/#Comment_344133" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T13:00:20+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  1:00PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monte did follow up on twitter to mention he's played some 4E, but not much ("7-10 games") and that he's aware of passive perception in 4E and thinks this is different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344134/#Comment_344134" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T13:05:07+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  1:05PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I read it that he's just kind of spitballing, throwing out ideas to get people thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344135/#Comment_344135" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T13:08:05+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  1:08PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit and now at least on rpg.net the conversation has taken a turn for the good and become quite an interesting discussion on how to handle perception.

And I'm finding lots of fun and interesting stuff to work with. Lots more than I would have expected.<br/><br/>I'm talking old modules from like the early 80s.<br/><br/>But most of the covers look horrible. Really horrible. And many of them suggest to me that the adventure inside will be totally different from what it is. Or they pick one encounter that has almost nothing to do with the overall tone of the module and put that on the cover.<br/><br/>Like Danger at Dunwater. 90% of the module is a lizardman cave. But the cover picture is a Saughain (which I probably spelled wrong but don't feel like looking up) riding a giant seahorse in the ocean. Which is sort of what the next module is about, but not quite. So the cover is totally misleading. Many to most of those old modules seem to be like that - at least the ones I've looked through so far. If the module were shrink wrapped, I'd assume it was a module about saughain and be totally pissed that it wasn't.

Being a brand means it must fit certain parameters, to be reproducible and marketable. So yeah, maybe we're all bored of the standard goblins and orcs, but that's basically part of the product identity. It's like McDonalds removing the cheeseburger from the menu. The creativity, sense of wonder and the fantastic is (and maybe always was) in the hands of the DIY/homebrew/OSR community.<br><br>So, yes, when you say "roleplaying" most people will think "D&amp;D" (and vice versa) in the way "fantasy" makes people think "Tolkien", and I don't see that changing. However, if you don't want orcs and goblins, you have to look elsewhere. I wouldn't say this is WotC's fault, no more than it's Tolkien's fault for being Tolkien. You want something else you're going to pick up Mieville, Harrison, Vance, Martin. Can't blame Tolkien for not being Howard. Can't blame D&amp;D for not being Vornheim.<br><br>I guess at the end of the day there isn't anything really stopping WotC from going out there and creating something new and different. But they've got established settings (FR, Eberron...), established parameters, product identity, brand name, overarching product aesthetic/art direction. They're comfortable with that.<br/><br/>There's also the system bit. I think it was Rob Donoghue who made me aware of it. The way the system is set up, 4E supports the action genre, as opposed to older editions which supported the adventure genre. (The in-between editions aren't really sure which way they want to lean.) That and the overly encounter-based, linear-adventure design really drives against the "sense of place, situation, environment". But I think location-based adventures are making a comeback. 4E itself is being tweaked in a way that opens it up to a more "classic" way of playing.<br/><br/>It is interesting how the modules, their art, their setup really influence the perception of the game. I think one of the reasons why we even have modern D&amp;D in the shape that we have is because most modules published back in the day were really tournament modules and later metaplot modules. Unlike Caverns of Thracia or Keep on the Borderlands, which basically showed you how to set up and run a sandbox, open-ended, non-linear campaign, GMs were educated to run a breadcrumb-trail game with escalating encounters punctured by exposition pieces. Even if the people running the company tell you <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=613" rel="nofollow">not to plan, to go along with the players</a>, etc. the adventures they publish are the complete opposite. And those adventures have over the past 20 years bred a culture of play that is very much embedded in many of 4E and Pathfinder's design assumptions.<br/><br/>Same for settings. For every high fantasy dragonlance plot, for every 1st level module with kobolds and goblins, for every re-hash of the central conceit, there was one Barrier Peaks spaceship less, one feverish hallucinatory dungeon less. The "moral clean-up" of 2nd edition that removed demons and devils also severed ties to the <i>weird</i>, the kind of fantastic fiction where (in Brad Murray's words) "there's not even an effort to find a distinction between fantasy and science fiction". It was a move to a specific, genre-ified, commercially-accepted fantasy. There's a reason why if you go to your local bookstore and look at the shelf marked "Fantasy" it's going to be full of books with swords, dragons, orcs and dwarves, even if there is not literary, historical or imaginary precedent for it (there are some good pieces on this by various people out there but I can't find them right now because I'm in a rush).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344224/#Comment_344224" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T07:34:54+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  7:34AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>So yeah, maybe we're all bored of the standard goblins and orcs, but that's basically part of the product identity.

I was reading walkerp's initial wonder/excitement statement and thought about my experiences picking up, flipping through, reading 4e books.<br/><br/>I agree with him. I dunno about Corporate/Kewlness, but I definitely don't have the wonder/excitement thing going. Okay, I'll even take Planescape off the table because that's an outlier, but what about the Dark Sun boxset (or supplements like Ivory Triangle, Preservers, etc), Al Qadim (my first thought), etc? I recently spent about two hours at a friend's house going through all of his 4e books (he has most, if not all, of them) - and mind you I *like* the 4e system - but not even the remade Dark Sun, Manual of the Planes, etc generated those feelings. He also had some Al Qadim supplements/boxes I never read before, and flipping through those, they did give off that sense of wonder.<br/><br/>Now, as I got older I spend faaaaaar less time on "reading setting without playing", and have the attention span of a gnat when I'm not solving "the data center exploded and everything's fucked" problems. So I tend to get bored by long setting sections. But it seems that with 4e supplements (like the remake of Dark Sun)... uh... "there's no foreplay". It's basically "here's a teaspoon of setting writing and WHAM HERES THE RULES ON RACES AND AWESOME TIERED CLASSES AND LISTS AND LISTS OF MAGIC WEAPONS/TREASURE". It's the feel of a lot of the books I flipped through. They're balanced, they're pretty (I like the art!), they're well laid out, but they focus hardcore on the rules front and center, and less on the majesty of fantasy. If that makes any sense? <br/>(the reason is clearly that "majesty/wonder" doesn't sell like New Rules do)<br/><br/>Not sure if the alternate is any good, as I said I don't have a lot of patience (any?) for long-winded setting that I can't use ("The major exports of Calimport are the following metals..." (ala Forgotten Realms 2e)), but there's likely a balance. Maybe like the Exalted books: The rules are clunky and take up a lot of the book (and if I had to choose, I'd go for 4e 9 times out of 10 over Exalted 1e or 2e), but they also focus a lot on that sense of wonder/excitement in fantasy.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344236/#Comment_344236" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T09:52:27+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  9:52AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I want from WotC is less analysis of the rules and more setting material.

I understand and appreciate a lot of the reasons 4E is put together the way it is, the class and encounter/skirmish balance, etc.  <br/><br/>While there is an appreciable difference in the amount of setting description between 4E and previous editions, I don't think that's the core of a certain lack of wonder for me for the current game.  Apocalypse World &amp; Ghost Echo have very little setting description and I feel a sense of wonder with them.  That feeling is conveyed principally by the magic of possibility.  Regardless of the current number of advances my brainer has achieved, there is the possibility that I might become the leader of a gang or a hardhold, or that I might scavange some Beforetech 4-harm AP autoburst flechette weapon out in The Bramble.  These things may happen if I roll well and if they follow from the fiction.  <br/><br/>In 4E, per intentional design and for perfectly fine reasons, even at 27th level, anything I find is going to be level-appropriate and is going to be incrementally and very slightly better than the items I had before.  Any new daily or encounter power I gain is going to be marginally better than what I had previously.  Possibly worse (!), and I may decide to keep my current powers.  Relative to even 3.X,  most magic items and spell rituals in the game have virtually no potency to affect the game fiction appreciably.  Understanding this, the sense of wonder, the desire to explore and to level up in a game is... diminished.  In a game that is supposed to be *about* that.  <br/><br/>Some of this is also vested in the amount of power and information provided to the players relative to the GM, a revolution begun in 3.0 and realized fully in 4E.  Those changes also came from worthy design goals.  But at a price.  Well-tuned and "balanced," modern D&amp;D is not very good at "leaving you something to wonder about."  I think Apocalypse/Dungeon/Algol World do a better job of that.<br/><br/>I like 4E.  It does a lot of things well and I had fun with it.  But I don't know how any pending edition of D&amp;D gets that "magic" back without a pretty radical redesign.<br/><br/>Andy: I missed most of 2nd ed. (doing other things), but I love Al Qadim.  I will not rest until I possess all of it.  I am really captured and inspired when I read through its supplements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344275/#Comment_344275" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T14:37:45+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  2:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, that's the first thing I noticed about Monte's article.

So like if the DM rolls up an arrow trap on the fly, he still has to decide how that actually works in the fiction before communicating that information to the players. If you have a string sense of your agenda and principles, it's easier to integrate random ideas into your presentation of a consistent setting without having to actually do the work beforehand. So you are discovering things along with the players.<br/><br/>If you're playing strict tournament style, you have to invent everything beforehand and you can only invent details in play, the amount of actual "discovery" you do (not counting discovering what players do in the dungeon) is minimal unless the players consistently ask for highly detailed descriptions. The advantage to having modules is that you can have a different set of setting-based agendas and principles for each module (different modules, different writers). The disadvantage is what you find in, say, Carcosa: the setting assumptions that James is posting about on his blog are not made clear in Geoffrey's original document, so if the DM doesn't interpret the raw data correctly, it won't get used as it was intended.<br/><br/>(To stay on-topic) Monte's passive perception by rank would be a concrete setting-based agenda/principle once certain types of traps are ranked. So, if only grandmaster trap detectors can find magical traps, that's a principle that says something concrete about the setting in a way that is much more easily understood by the part of the brain that understands narrative* than the more Gygaxian principle of say, magical traps are found 30% of the time by grandmaster trap detectors, 20% of the time by experts, and only 5% of the time by novices (or whatever). You would still need to interpret the result: why was this trap found / not found?<br/><br/>(* Another example, perhaps somewhat tangental: In the Iliad, Achilles is the greatest warrior of the Greeks. He wins every fight, every contest, no questions, no rolls. Ajax is the second-greatest of the Greeks, he always comes in second, always at everything ever. Hector is the greatest warrior of the Trojans, and he is exactly equal to Ajax, neither of them can win against the other. This is invariable, set in stone, a principle of the setting that any game set in the Iliad would have to come to terms with. If one player is Achilles and the other is Hector and they fight, you don't roll dice to see who wins, because that's not the Iliad. You would roll dice to see <i>how</i> Achilles wins, and <i>how</i> Hector dies.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344350/#Comment_344350" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T06:45:20+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  6:45AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input, Andy and nemomeme.

The same applies to the cover itself: there's a space between "The cover is made with the very best of intentions, to draw your attention and clue you in on how great the book inside it is" and "The cover is a blatant attempt to get you to buy this and they will put anything, literally anything on it if they think it will get you to fork over some cash."<br/><br/>And actually, I think that space might be occupied by "The guys in the art department thought this was the most awesome-looking thing we could get within our budget, so now it's the cover!

I don't look at Budweiser ads and expect the girls. These are both true things. I don't know how they're different, but as a person this is how I act.<br/><br/>Making a good cover that conveys your game is more and more important in the age of online ordering and box sets. I cannot flip through those, so the cover better do something to sell me. I might look at reviews, sure, but not always. <br/><br/>The cover's certainly not more important than what's inside, but it's a big part of getting me interested, communicating the setting/mood/whatever, and bringing the product as a whole together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344417/#Comment_344417" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T11:45:30+00:00" title="September 29, 2011 11:45AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Ok forget about the cover.

is more and more important in the age of online ordering and box sets. I cannot flip through those, so the cover better do something to sell me. I might look at reviews, sure, but not always.</blockquote>\nThat's kind of interesting: I would've thought that in the age of online ordering and box sets, the cover would matter even <i>less</i> when deciding what to buy, since you cannot flip through the book to see whether the cover's eye-catching qualities are backed up by what's inside.<br/><br/><br/>I tend to start with "I'm interested in buying a module for D&amp;D," then go directly to asking other people (online, typically), "What's a good module for D&amp;D?"  Or if I see a module online that seems to fit what I'm looking for (it's a D&amp;D module, it's got the right character level range, it sounds interesting, etc.), I go and ask other people whether it's good and check the reviews, because I learned in the '80s that buying <i>anything</i> for a game without flipping through it first or reading a reliable review was roughly equivalent to setting my money on fire.  Perhaps the industry has gotten better since those days -- sometimes it feels like it has -- but buying something, anything, without checking it out first?  Madness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15105/wizards-of-the-coast-rehires-monte-cook/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15105/wizards-of-the-coast-rehires-monte-cook">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15105/wizards-of-the-coast-rehires-monte-cook/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15105/wizards-of-the-coast-rehires-monte-cook/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15105%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15105%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
