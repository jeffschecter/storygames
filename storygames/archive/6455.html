It's called Cheap. At first it started as something that I wanted to play one night, but after playing it with multiple groups I realized that it was something I wanted to pursue further, and I have been refocusing it, tightening it, and developing it.<br/><br/>The game I have created is fantastic.<br/><br/>Cheap is a game about killing your narrator before he kills you. Someone is using you to play out their twisted fantasies, and you have no idea how to find them. You enter the game without knowing the rules, and you're forced to go over your head to figure them out. It's a game about power, abuse, how you use your knowledge, and how you use your ignorance.<br/><br/>The game feels like a departure from other roleplaying game experiences, and not because it's *trying* to be cutting edge, but because it evolved into this really cool thing that's all its own.<br/><br/>I'm at a place where I really want to share Cheap. And I found this really awesome artist, <a href="http://www.goldpiece.com/" rel="nofollow">Jesse Parrotti</a>, who I want to contribute art to Cheap. And these decisions are leading towards binding Cheap inside a physical product and getting it into people's hands so that they too can delve in.<br/><br/>I want to know how one best promotes a game.<br/>I want to know how one best promotes a game with a very volatile and unfriendly subject matter.<br/>I want to know how to market a game without explaining the rules.<br/>Cheap has a very intense, in-your-face playstyle. How do I communicate that without sounding like all those "Most Hardkore game Evar!!" nobs?<br/><br/>Cheap is a very simple game but requires prep work. That prep work is NOT playgroup specific, so it'd be easy to have someone else do the prep work and pass their materials on to you. How do I best facilitate this? One way is through supplement wheels (setting expansions in D&amp;D, for example). I was thinking about another way: What if you purchased a quarterly magazine subscription, and each issue had the full rules, any necessary updates, and a large bulk of that aforementioned prep work? Cheap is a simple game, procedurally, and thus the magazine could be 10% core game and 90% supplementary material. What about a prep-sharing network of types? What about setting up forums where people could post their prep?<br/><br/>This post hasn't given that much information about the game. If you'd like more, ask away!<br/>I'd love some suggestions, ideas and insider hints on how to market a game, and specifically this one.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142964/#Comment_142964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T14:55:52+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  2:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Magazine format is pure sex.

It's a game about power, abuse, how you use your knowledge, and how you use your ignorance.</blockquote>\nYour forced to go over your head? I've got an uncomfortable feeling here, because there's two alternatives. One is that the player isn't forced at all - if the game isn't fun in some sort of way that's compatable with them, they just stop playing it (unless their bugged to continue by the owner of the game).<br/><br/>The other alternative, which I don't like to think of, is that it actually is a game of social manipulation (not massive manipulation). The person is forced to figure it out because the social context their in is being manipulated - their only other option is to leave that social context. Ie, stop being friends/an aquaintance with you.<br/><br/>Mind you, alot of roleplay game designs have had groups fall into the second category, since they lacked 'fun now'. In the game, why are you trying to figure out the rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142975/#Comment_142975" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T16:52:48+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  4:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck a periodical.

A few months ago I had a dream that I was playing Cheap, and that the person running the game had the rules printed on the back of their shirt.

You are forced to figure things out on your own IF you want to succeed at the game. Reaching the end goal of the game (confronting your narrator) has the potential to be a powerful and fulfilling experience. Which isn't to say that the game is a "fun later" kind of thing. It's more like: When you run a marathon, your end goal is to cross the finish line. But crossing the finish line would be meaningless without the running part. And even if you don't reach the finish line, the running part holds a lot of meaning. You enter a marathon for the activity of running, but focus your efforts and training on the goal of the finish line. Maybe that metaphor is helpful, maybe not.<br/><br/>In Cheap, you are told one thing very clearly at the beginning: you want to kill your narrator because maybe that will end what's going on around you. The play experience hopefully is a two-fold experience: on the one hand, it is fun and involving in and of itself; on the other hand, it turns that whole "kill your narrator" thing from a prompt into a player goal.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/><br/>Ben,<br/>I can definitely provide everything in a single book/package. My exploring more modular options was born out of the fact that some people might just want enough of this prep stuff to get a sense of what they're shooting for when they do their own. Those people might not want to pay the increased price point of a product that included prep they didn't want.<br/><br/>The magazine thing could be cool because someone could pick up one issue, love it, start a game with their friends, and then decide to get the remainder of a year's subscription in order to get all that delicious, delicious prep and a wealth of game ideas. That said, the whole idea of "pay once if you want the core, buy a subscription if you want it all" would probably fall in the logistics department, because I imagine shipping costs are more expensive than printing costs. Maybe not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143004/#Comment_143004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T02:47:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  2:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the Dying Earth line, we launched the Excellent Prismatic Spray for support material.

Its obvious that something about the game is supposed to be a mystery. The problem with that is this: RPG games have a terrible history with handling mysteries poorly. Now, I know you and I trust you aren't doing anything too goofy.

It sounds like you have a cross-genre game.  Without knowing too much, I think many different types of role players and other types of gamers may find something about the game compelling.  Only you can determine what the audience is.<br/><br/>Beyond that, look to build a community around your game.  The thing that's great about printing background/supplement materials is that you can always invite fans of the game to submit materials or go on to forums and discuss their research.  That's a Good Thing.  In terms of package, I think you can sell subscriptions, but I would just call them supplements, not magazines or periodicals.  You might also consider delivering them as PDFs, it's cheaper and easier to fulfill.<br/><br/>I am not sure why you are concerned about not explaining the rules.  I think that you can describe the game in broad strokes and that should be enough.  I have bought numerous games without knowing the mechanics of the game.  I think if you let them know what is great about the game (and your description is a really good start) then knowing of the rules is largely superfluous.  Especially if the player is not to know.<br/><br/>As for marketing a game with violate subject matter...I think you put your cards on the table and say this game is about psychological tension.  The Saw films didn't try to package the movie as a comedy, you don't need to either.  Instead, keep circling your message back to what makes the game great: how its a departure, how the idea is to kill the narrator before the narrator kills you.  There are enough talking points in there for any banner, ad, email message, however you decide to promote the game.<br/><br/>Hell..."Kill your Narrator...Before the Narrator Kills You" should sell a good number of copies from that alone, I think.<br/><br/>Does the help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143392/#Comment_143392" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T08:02:32+00:00" title="May 10, 2008  8:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>So, back to what I said earlier, fill people in.

Thanks a bunch! I'm going to answer these questions in this thread over the next few days.<br/><br/>Chris,<br/>Thanks. That makes a lot of sense. I'm beginning to question the importance of the secrecy element, anyways. In the past, I've very much approached this as "I want them to learn WHY they're making a decision at the same time that they're asked to make the decision. Not before. Possibly after." The Premise (in the Big Model/Ron Edwards sense of the word) presents itself fully in a specific mechanical decision which takes place well into the game, and my thinking has been "if people learn X about the game, it'll change the way they approach this Premise". Maybe, however, that's fine for Cheap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143396/#Comment_143396" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T10:06:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2008 10:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2008 10:07AM by Judd.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really cheap?<br/><br/>Participate in a meaningful, positive and creative way at a high traffic gaming forum with a link to your game and a catchy title and sub-title in your signature.<br/><br/>Cheap: Kill your Narrator before your Narrator kills you<br/><br/>or something...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143409/#Comment_143409" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T16:58:07+00:00" title="May 10, 2008  4:58PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2008 5:15PM by Callan_S.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Callan,<br/>That statement assumes that you are interested in staying in the game. You are forced to figure things out on your own IF you want to succeed at the game. Reaching the end goal of the game (confronting your narrator) has the potential to be a powerful and fulfilling experience. Which isn't to say that the game is a "fun later" kind of thing. It's more like: When you run a marathon, your end goal is to cross the finish line. But crossing the finish line would be meaningless without the running part. And even if you don't reach the finish line, the running part holds a lot of meaning. You enter a marathon for the activity of running, but focus your efforts and training on the goal of the finish line. Maybe that metaphor is helpful, maybe not.<br/><br/>In Cheap, you are told one thing very clearly at the beginning: you want to kill your narrator because maybe that will end what's going on around you. The play experience hopefully is a two-fold experience: on the one hand, it is fun and involving in and of itself; on the other hand, it turns that whole "kill your narrator" thing from a prompt into a player goal.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?</blockquote>\nNot really. Everyone in a marathon is together in that they want to cross the finish line. They share this desire with each other that way, and it's a social bond (even between the guy who crossed the line first and the guy who passed out half way through - they still share something in common). <br/><br/>Here, the narrators player can't confront and kill the narrator himself. As I understand it, he doesn't share something with the player because of this. In the marathon, everyone forces themselves together to try and finish the race. It would be quite unpleasant if some people didn't have to force themselves (they can drive a car) and some did have to force themselves to the finish line. It implies some people are of a lesser station, that they should force themselves to the finish line while others don't have to. Here in cheap, the player is supposed to force themselves to do something that another person doesn't have to force themselves to do. And the only way out of that is to leave the social context - ie, stop being friends with them. Otherwise, your supposed to force yourself to do something no one else has to force themselves to do.<br/><br/><br/>* I'll note I wrote this based on an intuitive feeling. And in writing it out I've just figured out some stuff that makes sense in terms of forcing oneself to a goal, social position and building on Vs undermining RL relationships.

And by that I don't mean to imply you want to kill a real person. But rather. I am thinking of the movie "Stranger than fiction" where a character in a story gets to meet the author who wrote him. I think this approach is much less competitive/combative. While if the Narrator is just a place holder for the GM, then it seems like you have to personally defeat the GM in order to "win" or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile that could be fun, there is a history of this sort of behavior (us vs the GM) as a model for dysfunctional game play, and that is a hurdle your marketing efforts might have to over come as well.<br/>\nJust my two cents, keep the change...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143500/#Comment_143500" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T10:27:22+00:00" title="May 12, 2008 10:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I don't know Cheap, but as I see it, this is a totally artificial differenciation between the GM and the character representing the GM.

And in that, I make quite clear that if you do not find this sort of discomfort fun or engaging in a good way, it is absolutely fair to get up and leave the gaming session with no questions asked.<br/><br/>I've had friends walk out of games of Cheap before, and others play through and then decide it really isn't for them. It has in no way affected our friendship, and I kept playing roleplaying games with them. Just not Cheap.<br/><br/>When I say "you are forced" I mean, "the system is one that forces you to act in Pattern X if you want to succeed in game". There is no imperative to act in Pattern X in real life or outside of the context of the game, and indeed I would feel like things weren't working if that were the case.<br/><br/>Dave/DinDenver,<br/><br/>The GM-figure controls the Narrators. Which, in most scenes simply means they frame the scene and run NPCs. The only time when someone is actually "in" the Narrator character is during a Showdown, and then the GM does indeed control the Narrator. The sense of competition you speak of is present in the game, but it's not a players-vs-GM thing. It's a players-vs-GM's character thing.<br/><br/>What's the difference? The difference is that the GM isn't fighting to "beat" the players. Since the players don't know the rules of the game at the beginning, the GM could very easily "beat" them simply by choosing to make all the variables really, really difficult and frustratingly non-obvious. The GM's job is to provide situations and play them to the hilt, not to win. The players' job is to explore and exploit the situations. There is a sense of competition, but it's focused more towards a fictional character and a system than the GM-as-person.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? I think that what Algi is saying is that this differentiation is non-important.<br/>Algi, where do you live? I'd love to play this with you and see whether you see the differentiation or not in this case.<br/><br/>Judd,<br/>Good advice.

I've got an uncomfortable feeling here, because there's two alternatives. One is that the player isn't forced at all - if the game isn't fun in some sort of way that's compatable with them, they just stop playing it (unless their bugged to continue by the owner of the game).<br/><br/>As you put it, I think it falls into this catergory and there's no real pressure or being forced to go over your head. Perhaps it's more a game about pretending there's force and pressure. So it's a game about pretending there's power and abuse and how to use your knowledge/ignorance.<br/><br/>Perhaps selling it could involve presenting the idea of imagining your a fictional character with an evil narrator overlord to topple? That sounds weird and funny and an exercise in imagination to me - certainly more fun than TV!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
