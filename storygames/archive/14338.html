A lot of RPG design is about getting players to accept things happening that they otherwise wouldn't. In this case, Sean bought into the idea that something bad could happen to his character if he knocked the tower over in the process of pulling out a block, but he didn't have buy-in on the idea of bad things happening when he wasn't interacting with the tower in a direct and conscious way. That certainly made a lot of sense to me, and I was actually surprised that so many others took a "sometimes terrible things just happen, you've got to roll with it" attitude. Seeing what mechanisms do or don't get people to agree to fictional events is really interesting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ninesling" title="Ninesling"><img alt="Ninesling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ninesling">Ninesling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325743/#Comment_325743" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T19:44:48+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  7:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played this weekend on a table that you would have to take a jackhammer to in order to disturb the tower, so it was a non issue. We did however play this once at Recess when it was in the BRIC and the tables there were VERY wobbly. As a group we all noted that it added an element to the game that was really fun. It added to the tension and after all that is the whole point of using the jenga tower, right? We had talked this weekend about the possibility of painting jenga blocks with glow in the dark paint and using a black light with the lights off since you don't really have to refer to your character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325866/#Comment_325866" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T10:58:39+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 10:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br><br>Dread is a great game for illustrating issues about rules and exactly what the group is agreeing to when they agree to play by them.<br><br>I've seen people reject Dread because they don't like the idea that resolution is based on a real-world player skill.  This is profoundly bizarre to me as it some how suggests that RPGs are somehow games that don't require skill.  But I have some empathy for this point of view as it is not unlike my opinion that most American-style LARPs are based on a person's real-world ability to work a room and I find that troublesome.<br><br>Sean, on the other hand, had no problem with the real-world skill dimension but drew the line at the environmental rules (for lack of a better word).  He had not problem dying due to a failure of his own real-world skills but because he got too drawn into the game was upsetting.  <br><br>So during the discussion I tried to point that Dread is not a game where surviving means you "win".  It's not about beating the Jenga Tower.  The game is more about experiencing the mounting tension and that's diminished if the *environment* of the game is not, itself a threat.  If as the GM I'm drawing you in, and you lean in just a little too much and BAM! the tower falls because you bumped or kicked the table then that's the game *working* in my opinion.  It's a moment of shock both in the real-world and in the fiction.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327092/#Comment_327092" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T12:58:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 12:58PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a lot of good information and inspiration for a game I'm working on from this!
