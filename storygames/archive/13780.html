I am unspeakably excited about this new material.<br/><br/>For the upcoming Fiasco Companion we are including worked examples of what we're calling "packages", which are structural and thematic revisions to the core game to address different genres. The package in the Companion, which we're calling the soft package for now, includes new Tilt and Aftermath tables to change the game's arc from Coen brothers to John Hughes. The stakes are lowered, the problems are largely social, and it remains a died-in-the-wool Fiasco. Packages can also include rules hacks, one of which will appear in the March Playset of the Month, but they don't have to. <br/><br/>Anyway, to support the soft package the Companion will have two playsets I wrote with the romantic comedy in mind - High School (which will probably get a better name) and Regina's Wedding. Both also work with the default package just fine (You get <i>Brick </i>instead of <i>Ten Things I Hate About You</i>). We played High School with the soft package last night.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//fiasco/ricky_masters_goes_to_hell_ap_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the Setup</a>.<br/><br/>It became crystal clear early in the Setup that this was going to be about the school's Jesus Youth contingent, and Mike eagerly set himself up as their foil, challenge, and love interest - the despicable Ricky Masters. Ricky and my guy, the unfortunately named Robert Plant, shared an intense interest in getting into Jenny Tabuno's pants. Jenny, of course, was the purity-ring-armored leader of the Jesus Youth, an unapproachable bastion of holier-than-thou virginity. We knew her arc had changed when a Tilt element turned out to be "Sex: Somebody is pregnant". Robert Plant tried diligently to win her heart by being the better Christian, while bad boy Ricky Masters lied, cheated, and stole for her. There was a great turnaround when we discovered that Jenny Tabuno knew Ricky was a poor kid all along, and that despite all his desperate lies she really, truly liked him. He wasn't just a salvation-related project. She'd played him like a fiddle. It got a little harder-edged toward the end, and there was a great showdown outside Planned Parenthood as Jenny went through with her plan to get an abortion, despite the hateful attacks of her Jesus Youth compatriots on the protest line and the impassioned, paternalistic pleas of the shitbird Ricky Masters. The only guy who truly loved her was Robert Plant, and he was the only one waiting for her after the procedure, and she turned him down cold. There was also Mr. Tabuno's priceless Porsche, a weird kid everybody called The Goat Man, gruff study hall teachers, and every high school trope we could dredge up. <br/><br/>I was a little surprised how it played out. My friends are a nihilistic, black-hearted bunch of players and I wasn't sure they'd take to the gentler tone, but they did. And even knowing we were headed for a less destructive Tilt really informed play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311905/#Comment_311905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T13:28:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  1:28PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Wish I'd known about "Package" as a term about three days ago... <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ]<br/><br/>Sounds funky and cool--can't wait!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311933/#Comment_311933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T15:18:55+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  3:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>[Wish I'd known about "Package" as a term about three days ago... <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ]<br/><br/>Sounds funky and cool--can't wait!</blockquote>\nFiasco?

You can make your game lighter or darker in tone by choosing which to play.  Funny hijinks or terrible tragedy and black humor?  <br/><br/>You don't even necessarily have to pick which Tilt and Aftermath to use until you get done with Act One.  Maybe everyone discovers partway through that the mood is darker than they thought, or lighter than they thought.  Or they decide that the first act was lighter than they want, and the harsher Tilts could push the game in a more entertaining direction (or vice versa).<br/><br/>The same could go for some of the other fanmade playsets.  The <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/eusdvp0dyt" rel="nofollow">Muppet playset</a> could be a standard <i>Muppet Show</i> episode or it could be <i>Meet the Feebles</i>, and choosing the right Tilt or Aftermath could help make that decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311938/#Comment_311938" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T16:15:56+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  4:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That never occurred to me, Nick, but it's a great idea.
