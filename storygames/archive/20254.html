For example, "roll under ability score" is a technical agenda for a person who has strongly internalized this concept and considers it the hallmark of elegant rpg design. Likewise "run vigorously, scream and swing a sword" is a very important technical agenda for a certain type of live-action roleplaying game, without which the game simply isn't proper.<br/><br/>These technical affinities or preferences or assumptions range from trivial ("I like roll-under") to foundational ("A real rpg has a character sheet") to extensively complex ("I am a fully accomplished miniatures gamer, and thus all my roleplaying thought is filtered through the lense of setpiece skirmish, figures availability and terrain prep"), and the extent to which individuals internalize them as an "agenda" depends on historical accidence more than anything else: if a strong tradition of gaming in a certain way happens to be what you learn, then you will have insight, mad skillz and preference for that toolset, and the more extensive the toolset is, the more difficult it is to reach beyond it. That's a technical agenda, and being light or heavy or green or blue doesn't really enter into it, except insofar as there are historical traditions of play and design that may be characterized as mechanically lighter or heavier than each other.<br/><br/>If I were to attempt to apply this notion of historical analysis to the categorization of technical agenda, I would start with one extremely important and foundational technical tradition, namely the old school D&amp;D one developed and transmitted from the original American Mid-West gaming tables. This is a technical paradigm that includes things like an impartial referee, hex maps, party caller, randomized characters, ability checks - you all know what it has and doesn't have. Once we have the notion of this cultural tradition, we can compare individual examples of technical preference to it and say things like "his technical agenda is very old school" or "his technical agenda is only barely influenced by the old school".<br/><br/>I'll leave naming other important technical agenda families/traditions for later, I think it's pretty clear how this would shape out. You'll get something like half a dozen big boxes and maybe a dozen smaller ones, and can then proceed to combine them in various ways to describe the technical agenda of an individual in terms of cultural influence and history, which would then hopefully be useful for understanding and further development of that individual's agenda.<br/><br/>And yes, nothing in particular prevents one from characterizing a game by the combination of its techniques and Creative Agenda. My recent D&amp;D play, for example, would be "Gamist with old school toolset and Forgite analytics in the GMing methodology". That's pretty much the creative agenda plus the technical agenda right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
