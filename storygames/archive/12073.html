Malakim of Eli, warrior angels who serve the word of Creation, basically, can wield [i]anything[/i] as a deadly weapon: garlic press, limp fish, ballpoint pen, whatever. And you've got entire splats like Kyriotates (possession people or animals! Or multiple of them, at once!) and Balseraphs (lie so well that you can make almost anybody believe almost anything) and things like that. Oh, man, In Nomine.<br/><br/>Exalted! Where to start? I dig the Eclipse caste ability to sanctify any oath they witness, such that if the person making the promise breaks it, really bad things will happen to them. And the Sidereal Charmset? Avoidance Kata is my favorite out of a tough crowd of competitors, I think, which lets you retroactively go "I'm not here, and I never was here", whenever you suddenly find yourself in a bad situation. Or Avoiding the Truth Technique, which can make people really sure that you're lying, but you can only use it when telling the truth. And if you go into demon-summoning, man, Exalted's demons are awesome, but I expect no less from the brainchildren of Jenna Moran (aka Rebecca Borgstrom), who wrote most of them up the first time.<br/><br/>Spite: the Second Book of Pandemonium! The spell called "Penitence" transports you and a target of your choice TO HELL. Where you both remain until one of you is dead. There's a brief but tasty description of where you end up, including but definitely not limited to the sentence: "In the distance, vast and terrible windmills made of dried skin turn slowly, serving some unknowable function." Spite's full of gems like that.<br/><br/>I love superhero games with set lists of powers to buy, because it's so fun to browse them. "Ooooh, Duplication. Wait, Duplication... and Mimic! I'm a one-man Mirror of Opposition!" Mutants and Masterminds is the most recent game to scratch this itch for me, but I've also enjoyed Aberrant a lot more than I might have based on the system alone just for the opportunity to do things like "Mega-attributes across the board!"<br/><br/>Mage: The Awakening, you can conjure your inner demons and literally kick the crap out of them. There's an entire Legacy (school of specialized magic, kinda-sorta) based on this practice.<br/><br/>In Unknown Armies, there's a ritual wherein you can rip out one of your own eyes, and (attempt to) transform it into part of a horrible tentacled monster whose presence deforms reality, loyal to you, that you can then see out of (basically, your eye still works, despite being a part of this unspeakable thing instead of a part of you). These monsters can also crawl inside the skin of an appropriately sized corpse, and move it around like a puppet, albeit a disturbing one if someone looks at it too closely. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel characters with the Pardoner trait can change the Beliefs of other characters, as long as the new belief deals with the church, god, sin, or stuff like that, and as long as the character in question has the character traits of Gullible, Superstitious, or Believer.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure "The Device" from 3:16 haunts my unremembered dreams. Some day. Some day.<br/><br/>So what's some of <i>your</i> favorite awesome shit characters can do in various games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270446/#Comment_270446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T12:02:58+00:00" title="May  8, 2010 12:02PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Omni-Man.

Like most characters in that campaign, she was around so long that even the most powerful book NPCs were an even match for her.<br/><br/>What was most fascinating was that because she utterly lacked a moral centre, her casual violence made the other players (and hence their characters) start to think about the deaths they were causing and take steps to minimise them.<br/><br/>Just dropping "Taking lives is fun!" into the IC chatter after clearing a room of mooks worked a treat to wake everyone up to the fact that, action film setting or not, they'd just technically murdered over a dozen people.<br/><br/>I've not really played a game where I felt the same 'I am a total bad-ass!' rush as with Feng.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270469/#Comment_270469" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T19:54:08+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  7:54PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>And you've got entire splats like Kyriotates (possession people or animals!

Not even high-level powers, really, but the narrative room in Aberrant to customize how a characters powers manifest is really fruitful and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270507/#Comment_270507" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T12:07:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2010 12:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My guy could cast Magic Missile once a day.

Then he learned Continual Flame. I don't recall if I had some reason not to worry about the material components of the spell, but I don't recall being concerned about the cost. We spent several days in town, so each day, I cast the spell the maximum number of times on the blade of my sword. Of course, it had absolutely no effect other than giving off light.. But dude, an eternally flaming sword!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Vampire: the Masquerade, the very first time I played, I created a 4th Generation Vampire (hey, we were fast and loose with the rules...) and I'd pumped my strength WAY up this one time. Then I threw a car at someone. I <i>threw a freaking car.</i> How cool is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Riddle of Steel, my wife was playing an assassin type character. The PCs had fled from other assassin's trying to kill her for betraying the guild, and they were set upon in the middle of the night. She'd heard them well enough to go out into the dark woods to stalk the assassins while they were stalking the PCs.

However, I also refocused in my own GMing to make sure the PCs had the stage long enough to be awesome: In a high-powered game, this resulted in the typical Matrix-style kung fu stuff. In low-key games, this resulted in other effects like "getting exactly what you wanted in a high bluff/persuasion/etc roll, even when it goes totally against what I had in my notes".<br/><br/>Player-wise, my favorite moments were playing Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, Tenra Bansho, and With Great Power. The last was mostly due to the descriptive openness that you get with the rules. The middle was mostly due to creative, open GM and watching enough anime to know how cool "cool" is, and Dread... Dread was all about the action plus feel plus good GM. <br/><br/>For example, my slick-haired Brooklynite with Adidas shoes, track pants, a wife-beater shirt, gold chains and a 20 pound sledgehammer goes through security at a municipal courthouse on his way to fight a demon. He steps through the metal detector, which immediately goes off. I shoot one venomous "get the fuck out of my way" look to the security guards (I think a spell might have amplified the effect), and they were like, "Shit, this ain't even worth it" and let me through.

She was even capable of cascading subtle vibrations through her self in order to perform extremely quick computation and even real-time sonar estimation.<br/><br/>Game mechanics aside, some of my favorite character abilities came from how I played them. <br/><br/>Ernest Fidles could win Vampire: the Masquerade, even post-posthumously. By the time I retired him, because winning would have been no fun for anyone - least of all me if the Storytellers had made the correct decision to simply retcon the last year of what he had accomplished, he was working for the NSA, the Ventrue Andrew Carnegie, the Tremere, the local Prince - who ever that was this month, the Setites - thanks to some some out-of-game cheating possibly resulting from sexual favors, and the Technocracy. And was too valuable to all of them to kill. After playing Ernest, I was banned from playing mortals in White Wolf larps for years due to power concerns. <br/><br/>Alan McGregor was a studiously paranoid vampire. He constantly checked trees and other nesting points for bat form foes and after having been hounded by Malkavians for years he spent months thinking about where invisible folks are most likely to stand. He would often stare right at those places. Typically he would be wrong, but every once and while it would scare the skin off someone who couldn't be sure if they'd been spotted or not. <br/><br/>I once played a Setite who knew a library worth of occult lore, and behaved wrong - but was truly and earnestly helpful. He genuinely wanted to share his occult knowledge, believing that this lore would corrupt any who learned it. When I played him, I talked like the psychiatrist from Dark City. I was able to be so off-putting that once when I was talking to an FBI vampire hunter I freaked him out so much he wanted nothing to do with me, by politely talking about his benefits package at work. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270739/#Comment_270739" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-11T18:51:30+00:00" title="May 11, 2010  6:51PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2010 6:53PM by Elliott Belser.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know I'm not alone in playing a 4th Edition D&amp;D Warlock just so I could get the power "Hurl Through Hell" at 29th level.  <i>It does exactly what it says on the tin.</i><br/><br/>Also, regarding <i>Exalted.</i>  I took one look at the Eclipse caste and went "Wait, being the talky guy is stupid power- OH HELLS YES."

Eclipse caste solars can learn the charms (awesome special abilities) of ANY other character type, given someone willing to teach them. And they all get "parlay" rights automatically: basically, if I recall correctly, if they're there on diplomatic business, demons, gods, the undead, even the twisted and alien Fair Folk can't attack them first. If you're the talky guy, being able to walk up to the Demon Princes themselves and going "Let's talk about this like reasonable people, eh?" and <i>actually getting a chance to do just that</i> is total awesomesauce.

Little sharpened bullets of awesome are just what I wanted.  Thank you everyone for sharing so far.  And especially thank you for sharing the In Nomine love.  That game had so many great things that characters could do that it made my head spin, though the Malakim of Eli was probably my favourite.  That game stuck with me to the point that I still find myself occasionally saying "Do as thou wilt... but be cool."<br/><br/>As for me, I was often the GM in games so I don't have a really long list of awesome shit my guy could do.  As a matter of fact I can only really remember one clearly right now.  Aberrant gave us the power Element Control (or possibly Mastery?), which I immediately used to make an NPC called Crimson Red who was a Blood elementalist.  He would take little pinpricks of himself and shape the blood into blades that floated around his body.  The more people he killed, the more blood he had to craft with.  He would walk through rooms full of the dissected dead with not a single drop of blood anywhere on the floor, surrounded by a hundred red knives, all floating in air and circling around him.  <br/><br/>I also remember getting to play in a session of the Whispering Vault back in the day and my character was all about mathematics.  I recall describing him as looking like the Morrison/Philips Kid Eternity, but all of the negative space was filled with mathematical formulae.  His ranged attack, which I think is called Rend, was my character using math to disprove the existence of his target.  He would trace formulae in the air and his target would fall apart into nonsense numbers.  Man I loved how open the descriptions of the powers in Whispering Vault were.  <br/><br/>Oh, and I also played in a batshit crazy zombie tSoY game where my character was a woman who'd been bitten by a zombie but had tied off the arm that was bitten so only her arm was undead.  Think giant, twisted super-arm like the Nemesis from Resident Evil, but attached to Michelle Rodriguez, and you'd have my character.  It mostly meant for gross things (like I had to nail my zombie hand to the floor before falling asleep for fear that it might kill me sometime during the night), but it did have some advantages.  Like that it could split down the middle from between her middle and ring fingers and run up her arm to the shoulder, and become a gigantic snapping mouth, like a crocodile's.  <br/><br/>Can you tell that I read a lot of Clive Barker as a teenager?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270761/#Comment_270761" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T02:30:05+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  2:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my friends is constantly tinkering with a game called Autumn War... I think it's on version 12 or something crazy like that right now. One of the abilities that recurs in about half the versions is called "Mad Eyes". Basically, it lets you hear OOC conversation, IC.<br/><br/>It's kind of messed up if you think about it too deeply, but undeniably handy, when your character gets to hear the GM describing things that happen even if your character isn't present. I've had fun with it multiple times. (In fact, I statted it up as a Mutants and Masterminds power, once. ESP with the Dimensional Power Feat, the Dimension in question being 'the real world'. That's actually a pretty good system for being able to handle almost anything you can imagine with a bit of creativity in statting it up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270789/#Comment_270789" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T08:30:06+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  8:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this probably happens so often with White Wolf games that there's all the AMAZING SHIT you can do and the game never really lives up to it.<br/><br/>Case in point, I played a Tremere who had a really rare path (set of spells) that let her animate inanimate objects. She could also transform herself into an inanimate object of roughly equivalent mass and it would work just like the actual object. So if she turned herself into a TV, she would actually function as a TV. This was mind bogglingly awesome when combined with the fact that she'd gotten someone to teach her Auspex (telepathy). I abused that shit so much by sneaking into a room, turning myself into a chair or something, and then using telepathy to totally spy on them. That rocked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270798/#Comment_270798" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T09:32:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  9:32AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 3.5!

As a result, if he spends too much time in one place, it slows takes on an antique appearance, with all technology becoming magical in appearance (out of respect for other PCs, I didn't transform anything with actual points in it, just appearances).<br/><br/>Funniest incident: we had to take a plane across the country. By the time it landed, it was a dragon with a walled and glass-windowed houdah on its back, for the passengers (all PCs).

Another delusional PC (a common theme for me--LOVE those Psych Lims!). This guy was convinced that he was a WWI flying ace with a trusty midget sidekick. Both sidekick and plane were invisible--they were actually a Power Limitation on his Telekinesis: he could only remotely manipulate things that a human midget could reach/do, or that a two-seater WWI bomber could do (i.e. he had WAY low-Active-Cost Flying, too).<br/><br/>Funniest bits were when other (N)PCs would walk into the plane or trip over the midget. That would make my PC very irate, sometime demanding an apology for his "sidekick" or requiring the other PC to clean up the "smudges" from faceplanting into the "plane."<br/><br/>I *think* I also had some kind of variable power pool devoted to skills, randomized each session (i.e. to "whatever the GM thinks would be cool or funny"), which represented things his sidekick knew and "told" him, in a pinch.<br/>-----<br/>I could go on like this all day: I make very off the wall or iconoclastic PCs, most often. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270803/#Comment_270803" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T10:13:59+00:00" title="May 12, 2010 10:13AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Villains and Vigilantes.  Super hero roleplaying with all the fun that entails.  I was having problems coming up with a character concept and started flipping through comics to get inspiration, couldnt come up with much until I saw the tagline on the back of a comic I now forget that was simply  EXCITEMENT... ADVENTURE...DANGER...  Which somehow lead me to a character with multiple personalities who thought he was three heros, Mr Excitement, Captain Adventure, and Dr. Danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach had their own persona, costume and gear but all had the same super powers.  Mr Excitement dressed up as Uncle Sam with a red strobe light in his hat and some disco dancing moves. Captain Adventure had a rapier, a poofy shirt and a big feathery hat, Dr Danger was a commando in camouflage with knives, guns and grenades.  His powers involved mostly heightened ability scores, a bit of strength and endurance, a bunch of agility with one real super power absorption.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsorption worked by using an action to set up the ability so the next attack that hit the character would be absorbed and then turned into a combat bonus to damage with his next attack.  The group ended up captured in a force field that caused them damage if they tried to break out.  By setting up and using the absorption ability to take the damage from the escape attempts a chain reaction formed where the damage bonus kept building and building until so much damage was caused the force field could no longer hold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
