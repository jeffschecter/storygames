The Court-level equivalent was of course the Battle School, while the Story-level was the "PsychSim" or video game thing based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_in_the_Ender's_Game_series#Fantasy_Game" rel="nofollow">Giant's Drink</a> scenario from the original novel.  Students take turns "programming the sim" (i.e. GMing).<br/><br/>I also added in the idea of a group-created NPC bully \xe0 la Bonso Madrid.  The levels of safety were "The Bully mocks you in public," "The Bully attacks you away from the other students, but is interrupted," and "The Bully kills you."  Our Bully was a sly Italian kid named Tito.  I missed two safety rolls and got beat up in the middle of the night when I was awoken by Tito as he returned from some shady midnight business.<br/><br/>In the end, we had three great "fairy tales" and a very intriguing Battle School tale.<br/><br/>The first fairy tale was an outtake from the Ramayana, introduced by an Indian student*; it involved a love triangle between Prince Rama, Princess Sita, and the Demon Ravanna; the monkey god Hanuman was involved as well.<br/><br/>The second wasn't exactly your usual fairy tale: it was a noir film about a Private Eye named Dice Rockwell, investigating the "murder" (only he wasn't really dead) of a man named Gunther Glass who was linked to a jazz singer named Slinky Malone.  I got to be Knuckles Martini the mob boss (my bumbling flunky's name was Bunkie McCay).  I gave Lula a die just for coming up with those names (though poor Bunkie was my invention).<br/><br/>Third we had the tale of the Three Trickster Gods.  Anansi, Loki (my Student was Norwegian so I got to be Loki) and Coyote have been stranded on this island by Crow, and want to get off the island and get to the putatively yummy raspberry patch on the other side. Wacky hijinks ensue.  Of note about this tale is that it was GM'd by someone who has done very little gaming, was very turned off by some bad D&amp;D experiences, and had certainly never GM'd before\u2014and she totally hit it out of the park!<br/><br/>I may post more details of this game as the spirit moves me.  All in all it was a huge success, and a reminder of just how amazing Story Games like this usually are as far as efficiency goes: we had essentially four complete stories in just under three hours (and that was including a 20-minute break).<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*One of the things that emerged from my decision to put "nationality" as a line on the character sheet; it's not required but it's cool when players introduce via their Students stories with elements from that Student's culture.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302575/#Comment_302575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T08:46:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  8:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fantastic.
