Think "The Office."<br/>\n<br/>\nSetup: It was a three-player table. Two of us had played before, but the other guy who'd played before mostly played-by-forum. There was one element in the Relationships section that we had trouble with, it was an element that wasn't in the same format as the others. Otherwise, things went smoothly, and we quickly figured out that our players were father &amp; son at the family business (a paper company, as a nod to the series) and a shiftless cousin who was the janitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay: Things were very much PG for the first half of the game. We established our characters' personalities and roles at the business, and there were some hijinks here and there, but it was mostly pretty pedestrian. Mention was made of one character's casual drug use, but that was probably the most extreme thing that happened. When we got to the tilt, we considered using the soft tilt table because of the nature of the TV shows that inspired the playset and because our particular game seemed suited to that. But since the game was a playtest, we decided to do the less intuitive thing and go for the standard tilt table. All hell broke loose. Suddenly there were ski masks, assaults with baseball bats, people getting shoved off the roof, comas, disinheritance, and someone got smothered with a pillow embroidered with a motivational phrase ("Quality: It Starts With You"). I was surprised at how well the change of tone in Act Two went over -- we were enjoying the game during Act One, but there was a lot more laughter and glee during the carnage of the second act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345619/#Comment_345619" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T20:48:22+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  8:48PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 8:48PM by Brian_Minter.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joshnumbersbad</cite>... someone got smothered with a pillow embroidered with a motivational phrase ("Quality: It Starts With You"). </blockquote>\nHa ha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quinn" title="Quinn"><img alt="Quinn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quinn">Quinn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345975/#Comment_345975" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T10:19:10+00:00" title="October 14, 2011 10:19AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was there for the full time and I must chime in that Brian's game was indeed loads of fun!
