First of all, it's a fascinating listen by a very charming person. Second of all, it has made me stop and question game text books as a whole. Game texts are like dictionaries: they're not very booky books. Listen and see if you agree with me - is this not a very cool idea?<br/><br/>And now I have to figure out what to do with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175118/#Comment_175118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T20:13:39+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  8:13PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always said that game books are more like "how to write" books than fiction books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175123/#Comment_175123" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T21:04:18+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  9:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always thought of them as manuals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175358/#Comment_175358" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T19:13:59+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  7:13PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2008 7:38PM by madunkieg.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a pretty extensive background on this, so I'll try to avoid ranting about what she said as much as possible. Yes, some books are used mostly in a non-linear manner, and game books are of that type. Books incorporate many features that aid in non-linear use: page numbers, tables of contents, indexes, chapters, and much more. Some, like the Bible, even go so far as to number specific lines.<br/><br/>Game books have even introduced an advancement. At the back of Warmachine and Hordes (both from Privateer Press) various key words and terms are listed alphabetically, each accompanied by a short rules summary and a page number to the full text of the rules.<br/><br/>That said, electronic information presents a lot of great new possibilities, but these advantages come with a wide and sometimes crippling collection of drawbacks, not the least of which is the need for a working computer. Not only that, but I have yet to find a document format that really allows the possibilities to be explored.<br/><br/>Take, as an example of what could be improved, rules updates. When an electronic file is given internet access, it could contact the game company's server, download the latest rules clarifications and updates, merge them into the text, and create a list of them to bring them to your attention, but also allow you to revert to the older rules if you so desire.<br/><br/>That's just the tip of the iceberg. I encourage you to explore new ways to make your game books more useable, but don't bother worrying about how "book-like" game books are or aren't. That's an argument about semantics, not about how to better supply and organize information.<br/><br/>If you want to see an interesting example of how books and electronic information could be combined, watch the anime short "<a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-4088257039553148885&amp;ei=T0v5SIjvJoT0-gHt4_mIBA&amp;q=pale+cocoon&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Pale Cocoon</a>".
