But I realize that not everyone is into metal and so a substantial chunk of SGers were left out of the discussion.<br/><br/>So let me broaden the question a little bit more for our friends that don't dig the metal.  What songs have inspired you to create a roleplaying experience?  Was it a single adventure or a whole campaign?  How did it go over, or did it just stay in your head, waiting for the day when you would unleash it on your gaming group?<br/><br/>Just no James Taylor, please.                </div>\n<div

Almost every non-one-shot PC I've ever played, and most of my main villain NPCs have had them as well.<br/><br/>I have a compact little ipod &amp; speakers rig I can bring anywhere and it is always charged and ready to go with a series of playlists.<br/><br/>I made a rock and rap mix of 80s boxing and fighting themed music to play when facilitating Contenders.<br/><br/>I have a 20s mix for The Shab-al-Hiri Roach. (slightly anachronistic)<br/><br/>For Dogs In The Vineyard and Dust Devils I have a mix of Slim Westerns Vol 1 &amp; 2: haunting, soul-scarring Western instrumentals.<br/><br/>My last Fate campaign was inspired almost entirely by the 300 soundtrack but its theme song was Survivor's, Eye of the Tiger, both of which were played at each session.<br/><br/>I have a Ribbon Drive mix I adore and which is intended to inspire a road trip about longing.  The first song on the mix is This Mortal Coil's version of Buckley's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mUmdR69nbM" rel="nofollow">Song to the Siren</a>.<br/><br/>My Sunday group's two previous PTA shows each had their own songs which were played at the beginning of each session.  "No Man's Land," a show about soldiers in WWI, but inspired primarily by HBO's Carnivale had Conka by Apocalyptica as it's song/mood-setter.

A gun in a cyberpunk game played AC/DC (Thunderstruck, Big Gun, etc.). It had a volume knob in place of a safety. Whenever someone turned it on so they could shoot, I flipped on the music. If the volume was all the way up to 11, the gun switched to full auto (kind of a short burst coming from a six-shooter, but it was about attitude, not firepower). When I ran it again with a different group, I used Frontline Assembly's (Plasticity), because that group was a bit younger.<br/><br/>They sat around the table at the employment agency, staring at the gun. It was there when they arrived, black gunsteel and a twelve inch barrel. The six shooter had a knob on the side where the safety switch should have been and a little l.e.d., currently dark. It obviously belonged to somebody seriously badass, but in the hour that had passed, no one had come to claim it. Their number was called and the group shuffled into meet the placement specialist. He looked them over and sighed, "What are your qualifications?" One by one, they listed off their specialties, their employment histories, while the employment guy just sat there, clipboard in hand, until he interrupted them with a wave of his hand. "Hold it right there. What I was really asking was...do..you...have...a...gun?" One of the characters stood up, walked back into the waiting room, where a new group sat around the table, staring at the gun.They looked up with trepidation at him as he picked up the massive six shooter and headed back into the meeting, the opening guitar riff of Thunderstruck already playing, the l.e.d. lit green. The placement specialist looked at the weapon and put a big checkmark on the page on his clipboard. "Okay, I have a position for you..."<br/><br/>As for designing games, the pages don't fill until the game has a theme song. Spirited had Roxette's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8axwcs7bi8" rel="nofollow">Listen to Your Heart</a>, and Terribly Beautiful had Placebo's live rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAW1h8Q7E9k" rel="nofollow">Running Up that Hill</a>. Music is just so good at capturing an emotion, and that's useful as motivation to work through the little mental blocks that come with any design process. I'm never sure if it works on the flip side, that if someone reads or plays the game and also hears the music, that they'll feel the connection between the two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248177/#Comment_248177" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T18:28:05+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  6:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guano Apes' <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SAZrROyBWI" rel="nofollow">Quietly</a> was my inspiration for Natalie Sanduski in one of the games Matt mentioned.<br/><br/>And speaking of Ribbon Drive, the most touching game session I ever had was kicked off by Fleet Foxes' <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8CkxXhPtw" rel="nofollow">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> and Okkervil River's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY1ku4q2CkU" rel="nofollow">Westfall</a>.

There's something about refuge-in-audacity metal that makes for great <i>Showdown</i>; my other game was provoked by Lair of the Minotaur's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZE67TI5aZc" rel="nofollow">"War Metal Battle Master"</a>, which demonstrates the power of cheese. "War Metal Battle Master" lives up to its title, and the video's wholehearted substitution of enthusiasm for craft must been seen to be believed - as a gamer, I was inspired.<br/><br/>The adventure and setting I prepared for a (hopefully) forthcoming <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> game was inspired by Simone Dinnerstein's recent recording of the <i>Goldberg Variations</i>. I'll play that as the soundtrack for the part before the combat, at which point I may switch to a mix of more violent pieces. To me, Dinnerstein's take on the Variations evokes a place where thoughtful, calm study and planning are valued more highly than wading spear-point first into hip-deep gore, or muscular bluff and bluster.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD (was supposed to be in post in the first place):<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I did a Bat Out Of Hell roleplaying game, once.
