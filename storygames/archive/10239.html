In short, performance-based rewards and similar conditional incentives narrow one's focus, but impede creative problem-solving.<br/><br/>He believes the incentives that encourage creativity are three-fold: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Sadly, he only had time to discuss Autonomy in any detail.

On the one hand limitations can get you focusing on just certain things, but on the other hand they can force you to come up with some unique ideas or solutions that you might not think of if given more freedom. I know I've certainly come up with some character concepts due to the constraints of random stat rolling in D&amp;D that I'd never come across with a point based system that claims to offer more flexibility. On the flip side, I can also create character concept with a point buy system I couldn't with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>In play there's also variance, having a narrowly focused game like D&amp;D, which has combat being central forces you to think very creatively to fit a pacifist character in, that doesn't completely fuck things up. On the other hand, A Dirty World, which offers a great degree of flexibility in handling conflicts has some pretty wicked outcomes that you wouldn't find with a more narrowly focused game.<br/><br/>Narrow constraints I think create one type of creativity and problem solving while wide constraints create another type of creativity and problem solving. Some people might deal with one better than the other though.<br/><br/>As for incentives, I generally look more at obstacles as catalysts for problem solving. Incentives I think don't come up that often, but I think they would create a different kind of problem solving. For instance with XP and gold being incentives in AD&amp;D 2e, if you're going specifically at that, you'd look at a character concept that manages to get the most gold and XP as quick as possible, which would, using all the optional XP rules, leave you with a thief who breaks into trapped and locked houses to pick pocket the keys to treasure from the ocupants while inside and to steal small portable treasure with a high GP value to maximise GP and XP in one sitting. That being the optimal way of earning XP and gold at the same time would lead to a pretty specific and narrow play style. You'd have some initial creativity, and some creativity within the context of that narrow play style, but it wouldn't be sticking that long throughout play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227521/#Comment_227521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T08:40:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  8:40AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, true creativity does need to be as unfettered by rules as possible to truly flourish. However it has to be said that creativity is not always desirable. Sometimes the tried-and-true methods are more efficient, often for the very reason that they are so well established. It all depends on the situation at hand and the people involved and what you want out of them. <br/><br/>If the PCs are tasked with SAVING THE WORLD! (tm) and are given absolute freedom, they might decide to hell with the planet, let's find a way to get off this rock instead, right? And there's nothing in the slightest wrong with this as a storyline, but it can really screw up a carefully prepared scenario.<br/><br/>That's just a very loose example of one situation in which over-creativity may not be quite such a good thing. Personally, I *like* my games to be like that. Keeps me on my toes.<br/><br/>I also think that there is a point where restrictions become so tight that the only way out of them is to be extremely creative. If none of the usual methods could possibly work, then you've no option but to try something unconventional. This is a difficult situation to engineer however, especially in an RPG.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227560/#Comment_227560" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T10:05:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 10:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contra Ash: Being unfettered sucks.

Some people want to approach a problem logically and systematically, and very often that works better. Which is what I meant by the tried-and-true methods often working better in certain situations.

It reminds me of a book I read a while back, Punished by Rewards. In it, <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Alfie Kohn</a> discusses the many pitfalls of applying incentives willy-nilly. His focus is on education and child-raising rather than creativity, though. He also cites a boatload of studies. Unfortunately I borrowed the book from the library so I can't check up list the applicable ones here.<br/><br/>Some concepts I remember from the book:\n<ol>\n<li>The existence of rewards makes people concentrate on the reward rather than the task. So they tend to take shortcuts, take fewer risks, etc.</li>\n<li>The existence of a reward causes people to devalue the task.</li>\n<li>Weak extrinsic motivations can destroy strong intrinsic motivations (this is pretty well studied)</li>\n<li>The least intrusive rewards are the ones most similar to the task itself. e.g. if you're trying to encourage your child to read, reward every book they read with their pick of a new book, not money.</li>\n<li>Rewards are disempowering; they put people in the roles of "Authority Who Judges And Rewards" and "Subject".</li>\n<li>Rewards carry an implicit threat of punishment -- being promised a reward and then not getting it has the same effect as being punished outright.</li>\n<li>Praise and positive judgements still feel like judgements</li>\n<li>Competing for a single reward is even more damaging to motivation, learning, and cooperation than rewards on their own</li>\n</ol>\nI haven't played much Primetime Adventures, but it's an interesting game to analyze in this light because of Fanmail. I seem to remember someone (Jonathan Walton?) saying that as his group got more comfortable playing with each other, they used Fanmail less and less. Basically, Fanmail served as a way to help people synchronize playstyles rather than a system of rewards, so once they were synchronized, they didn't need it anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227928/#Comment_227928" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T12:02:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2009 12:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>How do you create incentives that will encourage creative problem-solving?</blockquote>Having just watched it earlier today, I think that it's important to recall that he says that incentives work on "mechanistic" activities, in which the process and goal are clear and direct. They slow people down on "candle problems" where one must think outside the box, but is incentivized to work quickly to get the reward. Is that surprising, really? Seems obvious to me, but I'm a space-out-and-ponder-for-hours kind of creator, not a "five sheets on the manuscript EVERY DAY creator.<br/><br/>Applying this to RPGs, then, becomes a matter of process clarity and goal versus open creativity and purpose. If the goal is "save the town from the threat" then it's rather easy to incentivize with reward ("and they will give you heaps of gold"). If the goal is "tell an interesting story" (or "really embody your character") then you won't get very far if you are rushed to do so: you get hackneyed story or stilted acting.<br/><br/>With that said, I am not sure how to directly answer your question, as a list of bullet points or similar, other than those he already gave: autonomy (AKA authority, in RPG terms, as one rarely RPGs autonomously), mastery, and purpose. You incentivize creativity when you give folks the reins to make the game they want. BUT, they will struggle if they do not also have a chance to learn how the game works and where it bends without breaking. MORE SO, they will flail around with kitchen-sink play (mutant ninja pirates in space) or hyper-cliched play, if there is not a purpose that pushes them beyond those local minima (e.g. in Universalis, one create Tenets to frame up capital-P Purpose--I also use the phrase Point of Play a lot to clarify this). That <i>is</i> a form of constraint, but not much more so than the "constraint" of the media used in an art form, or the genre one writes within, in a novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227963/#Comment_227963" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T13:39:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  1:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>The least intrusive rewards are the ones most similar to the task itself. e.g. if you're trying to encourage your child to read, reward every book they read with their pick of a new book, not money.</blockquote>\nThat part is particularly interesting to me in light of the typical MMO (and D&amp;D) reward structure. You're rewarded for killing monsters and taking their stuff by getting better at killing monsters and taking their stuff.

It's not universal incentive, put another way. And, further, I think most of the goals are (gamist) social rewards for being perceived as uber or leet, and the ever-expanding items and hyper-tuned builds are merely means to that end. And it's worth noting that those are VERY obvious procedures with discrete goals: ideal for carrot-and-stick incentives.<br/><br/>This makes me think of Spore, where the only real "completionist" play is accumulating all the bits and bobs, for full customizability. That game is squarely in the autonomy + mastery camp, and even a bit in the purpose camp... but that's left for YOU to decide--even more autonomy--unless we're going to say its purpose is completionism so you've unlocked the whole sandbox. But mastery is squarely there: most of the game is a slow ramp-up tutorial, culminating in an utter sandbox with scales you can drill up or down in freely.<br/><br/>Note the similarity to, say, Roller Coaster Tycoon: a scenario might have a simple purpose (earn X money in Y time), but the constraints of available land and time to invest in detail breed a LOT of creativity. I recall my favorite scenario was to build a rather big park on a postage stamp of land, which meant one had to fully engage one's mastery of coaster design, park layout, path routing, and staffing so that you ended up with this multilayered park, with rides under and above each other, decorative elements doing double duty for theming multiple rides, and some crazy (and fun) pathing to get the peeps through this amusement-park-meets-jungle-gym. You had (nearly) every tool in the box (barring some advanced coaster designs which prolly wouldn't fit anyway, and some themes), it forced you to push your own skills at design and aesthetics (or not, for the latter) to their limits, and all with the tiny, tiny "purpose" or "make this park worth X" (where X was REALLY high, realtive to the space--huge density).<br/><br/>This must map to RPGs....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228048/#Comment_228048" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T21:51:41+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>I think there's one big hurdle in applying Pink's ideas to rpgs - in the candlestick problem, you have real logistics to overcome through creative use- in rpgs, you need only convince the group or authority that you have produced an adequate solution for a "problem" and then it's solved.  Depending on the group/authority, your ability to communicate, and the shared understanding of fiction between you all, that's either really easy or really hard.<br/><br/>With rpgs, you're probably encouraging something along the lines of "entertaining" and "plausible" with the specifics depending on the game, genre, and group.<br/><br/>What I do think, helps for creativity in those cases, is actually limitations.  By producing required limitations you give direction that players must fit within and that actually tends to create some inspired input.  "If I want to get a reroll, I must somehow include 'Useful piece of geography'?  Hmm, how about THIS!" etc.<br/><br/>As far as reward mechanics, they're very often only a lead towards something, not the thing in itself: BW's Beliefs and Riddle of Steel's SAs motivate you to push towards them, but the real meat of play comes between deciding how much you'll sacrifice in the name of your beliefs, or if you realize your beliefs cost too much, or having to choose between them.  Dogs in the Vineyard's Fallout isn't really a reward- it's a tool to force you to say something about how your character has changed from all the madness you've just dealt with.  Fanmail gives you some sway, but not nearly as much as spotlight- it's more a tool for players to communicate with each other what kind of content they want to see...<br/><br/>In other words, mechanical rewards don't get you to do the thing itself- they get you to put yourself into positions to do the fun thing.  Even D&amp;D's XP is a tool to gear you for the next tactical encounter/strategic plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228089/#Comment_228089" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T07:22:57+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  7:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't this just another iteration of the "fruitful void" concept, then? Good (mechanical) reward systems don't point directly at the point-of-play, they feed a cycle of intensification and elaboration of situation around that point-of-play until the players fill it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228107/#Comment_228107" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T07:59:51+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  7:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>Yep.  <br/><br/>Which is why the situation is different than Pink's issue- in that one he has a pre-defined endgoal ("Get the candle on the wall"/"Make money for the business"), while rpgs, even with definite creative agendas, may have a very, very wide range of possibility about what it's going to be in terms of creativity.  The mechanics exist to get the group aligned at the place of creativity and to coordinate amongst each other- it's less reward and more group communication and facilitation that mechanics, setting, etc. are doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
