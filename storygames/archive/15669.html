I would be willing to document out game for the forum here so others can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if you are interested.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn" title="malachijohn"><img alt="malachijohn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn">malachijohn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355280/#Comment_355280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T16:09:58+00:00" title="January 21, 2012  4:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be speaking over Skype.  For now just one session, but if all goes well we could make it a regular thing if all are willing.  Obviously we would like to have four players max, but three could suffice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow keep in mind that I haven't played this yet, but i have read the rules several times so I "know" how to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
