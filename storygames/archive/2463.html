                    Well, I was going to type this up here, but it is WAY too long already for the forum to take it and I'm only 1/4 of the way there. What I'm going to do is take what I've already written and slap it up onto my LJ: <a href="http://meserach.livejournal.com/1037.html" rel="nofollow">Part 1 of the playtest</a>.<br/><br/>i encourage comment. Should I also write up a more distilled version with less of the big chunks of IRC logs? Continuie as I am for the rest of it? Both?                </div>

                            Don't be lazy; follow the link and read the report. It's good stuff.<br/>
I played in another, short two-scene test last week. That time we had a US Civil War setting: Colonel Abernathy, the Honourable Southern Gentleman Soldier, first sacrificed Love of Helen for his Army Career, only to have his commanding officer send him to suppress Union sympathisers. That's as far as we got, so we never saw what atrocities he had to commit.<br/>

Tom, why don't you write up a summary of what your game is about in this thread? Because I'm not sure how much sense what I wrote makes without some context. And since you're the author, I think the honour falls to you (Conveniently relieving me of having to explain ;)                        </div>

                            Well, I can try for a summary:<br/><br/>The game is about Tragedy, as a genre of stage drama. The idea is that protagonists are placed in situations where they care about too many disparate things, and the game forces you to choose between them or lose them all.<br/><br/>So, each character has a number of Causes, each of whidch has a number of dice (three, currently). When you roll the dice in each cause, you're hoping to achieve a certain result (at the moment, a sum of 15 or higher), in order to achieve a consoaltion - which is a scene of happiness amid the tragedy that you get to dictate, analogous to a Monologue of Victory from the Pool. However, all the 1s you roll are discarded. Shoudl you ever, by choice or misfortune, end up with zero dice in a Cause, that Cause suffers Tragedy - soemthing so terrible that your ability to ever again fulfil that cause is almost irreparably destroyed, the very nadir of your experience.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, you're narrating. When you shift dice about, you have to narrate how your're doing it (Sacrifice) - so if I emphasise Romeo over my family, it means I sneak out of my house after dark, that kind of thing. When you discard 1s, another player narrates the horror that befalls you, or dictates the terms of a suitable scene. Other players are always the antagonising forces in your scenes, pushing you until thy are satisfied that the sacrifice is a true one, or the misfortune is bad enough. (given the magnitude of the dice). Taragedies are similar, except that they shoudl awlays be full scenes (as well as possibly incorporating some narration to audience) and here you gotta keep pushing until it hurts a little.<br/><br/>The game is basically designed to screw you from the word go, ensuring that you're almsot certainly going to suuffer tragedy eventually - the only question is when, and where. You can even burn your Life itself for extra dice - but burn it too much and you die. Hence, there's a temptation to burn that final bit of life for one final Consolation...<br/><br/>I want to encourage players to speak to the ausdience directly as an audience as well as portraying the characters in scenes.                        </div>

<br/>
First of all, let me say this game is right up my alley so I'm excited.<br/>
<br/>
I really like that ADamiani monologue to the audience. If that isn't a game rule, I'd say make it one. For me, it really grounds the story as a personal one. It feels more personal as the character recounts what has happened. Obviously you wouldn't want that to happen at the time, but it would work as fixed part of the game flow perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
"My dice sucked BAD, though. I lost dice everywhere..." Is it wrong that I went "Hell yes!" and made a Kirk arm gesture in response to that? Perhaps one could stow away a building time-bomb of losses instead of dealing with it all at once though, but that is just my crazy game design tendency talking probably.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll see if I can't hook up with you for an online session soon. Rock on!                        </div>
