Fashion is the whole point isn't it? Minis with clothes you could change. What if it was something like Costume Fairy Adventures, where quick-change costumes are how your character gets her powers? In order to change your powers in the game, you'd have to change the clothes on the mini too. It's genius!<br/><br/>Of course, for the minis to be able to change clothes, they'd have to be less mini, more "bigi". One advantage of being big is that they would be posable! but two disadvantages would be that they would be more expensive, and there would be less space for more of them on a table. You could play on the floor, maybe. <br/><br/>Maybe the design of a game like Threadbare, by Stephanie Bryant, could include mini-play by making use of actual kids' toys on an actual floor in an actual house, with big tables listing stats and rules for all the different types of toys you find out there, from action figures to Legos to Transformers to Barbie to teddy bears.<br/><br/>Fantasy environments could be represented by big, full-page printout versions of scenes and creatures you don't have toys for, like you have in Index Card RPG, but larger than index cards, obviously. Also, there would be no need for cutting them out because there would be no need to fit them on your table. Kids play on the floor. Why can't we?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yeah!

Barbie is a doctor but gets into a car accident in her pink cab etc. Building cardboard houses for them, using wrapping paper as wallpaper etc. Putting a broken wristwatch as the wall clock.<br/><br/>Even designing outfits for the NPC:s is using skills I learned back then\u2026 but painting instead of sewing.

Yeah, there should be some way to systematize that for grownups who've lost the ability to do it the way children do. We need rules, win conditions, and such things, or else we don't quite feel like we're learning as much as we want to. <br/><br/>But if you think about it, a dungeon isn't really a story either. Neither is a board game. They're both very much situations to play through, so in many ways, that could provide a kind of model for this play also. What if the idea isn't necessarily to tell a story, but to play through situations that can then stitch together to form a story, like scenes or dungeons, or both. <br/><br/>Even things like tapping your doll to the table while it talks could become significant to the rules, just like stabbing your character sheet with a knife is in <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>. For example, having dolls and identifying which one is talking that way could mean that a single player could more easily manage a troupe of characters, because who is doing and saying what would be represented with this sort of tactile information. If they were exploring a dungeon, for instance, as mapped out with printed scene papers (Index Card RPG-style), then this would allow for 2 or 3 players to manage 6 or 7 separate characters in the situation. The number of times they tap the table while talking could even be significant in some way (or not), possibly like (for instance) the way that the number of details you describe for your action gives you more dice when playing Wushu.<br/><br/>To take a different example, not a dungeon, suppose you had different scene drawings showing locations, like a cab, or a hospital, or whatever. Players could always move through three stages of every situation (problem - twist - solution), with the location drawing letting them know where they are and what sort of thing they should be doing in each stage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464690/#Comment_464690" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T12:20:23+00:00" title="July  7, 2017 12:20PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In many Scandinavian languages, "pretend-play" like "let's pretend this floor is lava" is a different word from "gaming" like chess or WH40K or bridge.<br/>And, the noun and the verb is the same.

What is important?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464709/#Comment_464709" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T12:28:38+00:00" title="July  8, 2017 12:28PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>First of all:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The map <em>is</em> the territory when doing toy play.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To summarize previously stated points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Puppets, not chess pieces.</li>\n<li>Toy appearence &amp; fashion is important</li>\n<li>Set up situation rather than story</li>\n<li>DIY / prep is play</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464710/#Comment_464710" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T12:32:07+00:00" title="July  8, 2017 12:32PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That synopsis is a thing of beauty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464711/#Comment_464711" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T12:33:17+00:00" title="July  8, 2017 12:33PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate that compliment very, very much.

Actually they seem to be two crystallization of the same playstyle originating from toy soldier playing.<br/><br/>Our principles:<br/>1. The PC pool consits of 'dolls', definitely more than the number of players.<br/>2. The PC as RPG characters are consciously shallow (so everybody can play with them), they are mainly characterized by their 'doll's appearence, but active gameplay and shared memories can deepen this with invisible layers.<br/>3. Players have two hands so they can hold unto two dolls simultaniously any time. Interaction between two PCs held by the same player is OK here!<br/>4. Gameplay is structured by different phases (who goes to a particular mission, who goes adventuring, what happens with the PCs who stay at the base, etc.), so the story is not about an adventuring party or a team but about a community.<br/><br/>This structure seems to work very well. The adorization of these dolls as eidolons (similar as in Swords Without Master) is so strong, that it even works without physically existing minis. We often play online without any kind of virtual table, only using imagination and google doc files, not real dolls!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467032/#Comment_467032" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-15T18:22:25+00:00" title="October 15, 2017  6:22PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't help grunting reading the first posts, but I think I like 2097 puppeteering approach. It stresses emotion and action over abstraction and negotiation. The rules would be : how many hands can be involved, because talking time is not as much an issue as handling space. (perdon my english). <br/>Some key elements : the various sets, the number of hands (active characters) each player has in one set, who opens the scene (like the one character already there has priority over the others and can choose to yield ), mostly argumentative conflict, so it's clear whose turn it is to speak, maybe a one step escalation signal (BAM BAM) (if the minis are not fragile). Moves : use scenery/item, combined moves talk/noise imitation+body/gesture. Maybe could use some LARP moves and materials. I think we can have nice drama / mystery / thriller adventures.<br/><br/>In a nutshell : puppeteering x improv.<br/>I would drop the fashion - accessory part : having done a little puppeteering myself, it's THE love breaker in the hobby. <br/><br/>To play, I'd recommend the hand puppets used to amuse little children (cheap, varied, soft, easy to use, naturally prehensile). With a different set of rule : one-finger puppets. More abstractly, any item can be used, in which case I suggest adding in music and lighting : this is called "object theater". Gameplay sessions on Youtube. <br/><br/>Now I want these rules for pupils to run mini shows in the classroom (art x language) !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467042/#Comment_467042" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-16T15:08:59+00:00" title="October 16, 2017  3:08PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2017 3:09PM by Vivificient.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Thread made me think of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ultima+online+doll&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFy4Gt8_nUAhXsxYMKHXKIAHAQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974#tbm=isch&amp;q=ultima+online+paperdoll" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

With gaming minis, having a largish collection helps.<br/><br/>Eero did an experiment a while back using that general concept. <br/><br/>IIRC, Eero's finding was that "weird" gaming minis tended to get picked and have a strong concept created related to the visual aspect of the mini in question, with slightly shallower additional personality creation involved. More "generic" minis tended to see players adding a lot more on the personality/background aspect of non-mechanical chargen.<br/><br/>Which is really the sort of thing I would tend to expect.<br/><br/>A goblin flying on a bat has a concept that strikes you right between the eyes when choosing the mini. Ditto a pirate captain. OTOH, a mini that is more "general fantasy medieval person" gives a whole bunch of open space to decide who that character is as it's created.<br/><br/>I don't think one is better than the other, but I suspect the different miniatures types appeal to players differently, or maybe, different sorts of players.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467047/#Comment_467047" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-16T17:06:20+00:00" title="October 16, 2017  5:06PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kids tend to mix and match, like in the Toy Story movies, so Transformers fight against LEGO minifigs or Matchbox cars with (invisible) machine guns on them.<br/><br/>Adults are more self-conscious about this I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467051/#Comment_467051" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-16T19:11:17+00:00" title="October 16, 2017  7:11PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

I don't have a train to catch and it's about two hours before I need to leave the house again.<br/><br/>My main question is wether kids and adults play for the same reasons. With this I mean that toddlers and primary school kids use role play mainly to practice skills/things they have observed, to make sense of their world and try to understand it. They learn to use words in certain contexts and learn what professions are, like bakers, doctors, ... and they practice social skills with it. Mainly. In fantasy play they also seem to just emulate what they have seen/heard on TV or during story time, though they might reverse the roles because "dragons are more cool than knights" or some such thing.<br/><br/>In adults, it seems mostly to be revolving around escapism, though it can be used to resolve deep lying experiences or trauma's (same goes for kids in this case) but hat's more of a therapeutic thing than a nice evening of gaming.<br/><br/>Should this context be kept in mind in trying to adapt child play to adult play? Do we even need to convert if we play for different goals?<br/><br/>Anyway, these are my first thoughts on this topic. I hope I'm not derailing too much with this question, since some people seem to already be enjoying this kind of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, not sure about that last question.<br/><br/>For me, when I try to put a minis not-wargame together, I'm not really doing anything terribly different from what I did as a kid at a certain age.<br/><br/>Usually, I'm mashing together a couple of core concepts, pulling together a collection of toys related to that mashed concept, and then hopefully getting a couple of friends together who I suspect will dig that pairing, and running with it to see what happens when they add their take on the combo, and events develop through play.<br/><br/>So yes, creativity, but also a call back to known "intellectual properties" or genres, etc.<br/><br/>Really, just an older aged version of what Danny K was talking about upthread:\n<blockquote>Kids tend to mix and match, like in the Toy Story movies, so Transformers fight against LEGO minifigs or Matchbox cars with (invisible) machine guns on them.</blockquote>\nAs kids, we'd get a few friends together and bring out our Star Wars action figures, and play at various kinds of new or untold adventures of those characters.<br/><br/>They weren't competitive games in any way within the fiction, although there were certainly challenges, mostly involved with making everyone's story ideas fit together.<br/><br/>When it worked, it was wonderful fun.<br/><br/>Mostly, I'm just interested in methods to create a similar vibe for a similar kind of play, but for people beyond the age of 10 or so.<br/><br/>What I often find though, especially among gamers, is that t is terribly hard to unlearn the idea that minis=wargame, both in terms of methods/mechanics/rules and in terms of goals of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

games doesn't feel that different to me than what I used to do playing with my "guys" in the sandbox at age 8 or so -- what I posted about the "Toy Story" setting was pretty autobiographical. <br/><br/>Even at that age, I would make up more biographical details about my anthropomorphized Matchbox car than my little friends cared to hear about, so I learned to keep them to myself and develop them in my mind.  <br/><br/>When I was playing games like AD&amp;D, Arduin Grimoire, and Twilight 2000 in the 80's (now I'm seriously dating myself), I would do the same thing, make up well rounded characters but keep most of the detail in my mind because my fellow players didn't want to hear it or engage it in any way.  <br/><br/>EDIT: The other thing I recall is that sometimes the most minor features would get seized on to differentiate the figures -- the cars or army men could be very similiar-looking but I'd interpret things in fanciful ways, like saying that the spoilers on the car meant that it could fly through the air or go underwater. Without a mechanical system to regulate these things, it just made the play more interesting. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467181/#Comment_467181" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T13:07:31+00:00" title="October 23, 2017  1:07PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't feel bad about dating yourself, DannyK.<br/><br/>I was in a minis+ thread one time, and a comment by anther poster led me to suspect they were envisioning me as a very young gamer.
