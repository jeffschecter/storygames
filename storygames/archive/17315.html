There's plenty of room for diversions along the way, mind you. Kale might end up stealing something of Lady Blackbird's, for example, because, hey, shiny. Snargle might cut a deal with a fellow goblin passing as a human trying to gain passage. The Count that Lady Blackbird was arranged to marry in the first place might show up if she blows her cover at some point. A sky squid attack is almost mandatory.

It's right there in the "Obstacles and Difficulties" section!), and the example additional tags (Bloodhunters! Ghostbloods, Voidbloods, Dreambloods, and more!) and so on. Read these before play. Right down any and all of them that sound awesome to you, and be sure to incorporate them. If it's awesome to you, you'll come off as enthusiastic when you bring it up in play, and that really helps a game out. Like, whenever I run Count Carlowe, the guy Natasha was arranged to marry, he's almost always a Ghostblood because that shit is creepy. When the players are at Nightport, they'll usually run into at least one Goblin who's learned the art of mimicing shapes, and at least one weird sky-squid cultist who happens to be seeking passage, and probably a Bloodhunter patrol who will recognize Lady Blackbird as a Storm Blood, and since there's a sizeable bounty out on her, ask her a few inconvenient questions. (Or to a lesser extent, Vance as a Warpblood, which is an awesome way to offer an opportunity to flashback to Vance's life as an Imperial and why he's no longer one as a refreshment scene)<br/><br/>Also, if you've got less than five players, my personal preference for running is that it works a lot better if you don't have a subordinate character as a PC when the character in charge of them is an NPC. It's a lot more interesting to me to leave the important decisions in the hands of the PCs than having them go to an NPC for orders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392530/#Comment_392530" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T07:29:11+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I would say that Lady Blackbird is not really the game for one-shots.</blockquote>\nWhy not?

However, I feel that the story should be played over a few sessions and that the game shouldn't be forced with hard scene framing, so the GM can "finish" the story.<br/><br/>Note that I have only played it once on a convention (we stopped after we were about to leave Hand of Sorrow), talked with others who lead the game at conventions, and read it myself a few times. But because the GM should ask questions most of the times, I got the feeling that the players should control the pace. And because they control it, it will be hard to estimate the amount of time that it takes to come to the end, whatever the end may be.<br/><br/>I'm normally all about hard scene framing. I once played a campaign that normally takes 1,5-3 years to finish in five sessions (and I also added stuff!).

I almost have to ask. Messier than starting in the brig of an Imperial ship, surrounded by marines, with your ship impounded, its several outstanding warrants moments from being discovered? And the characters are already... pretty at odds. I mean, you would be hard-pressed to name any two characters who don't have some conflict of interest built right in.

That's pretty messy!<br/><br/>What's less obvious, though, is what happens if they succeed in escaping from the Hand of Sorrow. Now it's very open-ended: other than a continuing chase by the Imperials, the story can now go in all sorts of different directions. There's this vague goal of finding Uriah Flint (I say vague because he might be just around the corner, or because he might be impossible find, or anywhere in-between), but there's no guidance on what happens once you get there. Either the GM (and/or group) comes up with something brilliant, or... not.<br/><br/>So, if the one-shot is all about escaping from the Hand, the game supports you pretty well. If escaping from the Hand is just the first part of the scenario... what happens next is very open-ended.<br/><br/>That open-endedness is a deliberate feature of the game, of course, and I appreciate that.

It's a honking big ship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson" title="Axkidson"><img alt="Axkidson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Axkidson">Axkidson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392784/#Comment_392784" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T19:44:03+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  7:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 7:44PM by Axkidson.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say something big to keep in mind is if you have players that haven't played before<br/>you need to explain the refresh scenes to them, i have run this at cons twice and neither time did they use one<br/><br/>that said I don't think i will be running a different system at Cons anymore just take the blackbird system hack it and your done, I really enjoy blackbird as a one-shot game<br/><br/>edit: John_Powell is on the ball always leave with a cliffhanger                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392848/#Comment_392848" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T09:45:41+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  9:45AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, there are already over a dozen LB hacks out there, so it seemed a likely match for a con one-shot.

Players may still advance by buying off Keys, but hitting Keys always just gives you Pool dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392867/#Comment_392867" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T10:46:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 10:46AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, call for refresh scenes. Use them to ask interesting questions. "So, maybe you're thinking about how to win Lady Blackbird's heart, and it triggers a flashback to the time you first met? What was it about her that made you fall in love?" "How about a scene where Kale and Naomi happen to be eating breakfast at the same time? You guys don't know eachother too well, I gather, so what do they end up talking about?"  Don't forget you can use the refresh scenes, in addition to the refreshing the pool, to "recharge" one of those 'once per session' Secrets. That's important for con games and something a lot of people miss. It also allows you to be a lot more indiscriminate about warpblooding around or lucky breaks left and right, which is only a good thing in my book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
