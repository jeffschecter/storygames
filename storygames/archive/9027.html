I have long admired many parts of the indie time-travel game <i>Continuum</i> -- which, coincidentally enough, also uses a kind of action scripting to handle time combat -- but the system itself is needlessly fiddly and not nearly as elegant as MG.<br/><br/>So I just finished hacking MG to run <i>Continuum</i> in a way that I think is going to be really cool.  <a href="http://plays-well.com/BurningYet.pdf" rel="nofollow">The character and combat sheets I made for the game are posted up here</a> (PDF).  I'm only having a problem trying to figure out what the "Cobweb" stratagem should do, aside from serving as a Feint.  If anyone else out there is familiar with both <i>Continuum</i> and <i>Mouse Guard</i>, I would definitely appreciate some help.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I think most people with knowledge of both games should be able to run this pretty easily, just from the character sheets.  Once I actually get around to playtesting this hack, I'll try to write up a one-sheet of guidelines for making it work well.<br/><br/>P.S.

Take a point of Frag, gain 2 points (the base for MG, right?) in a skill.  Then, after the time combat is over, hope you can heal the Frag.  But this is basically only usable in a Matrix-style "I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter" situation, not to improve skills you already have.  If Luke had written Continuum, he would have dropped a boot on people trying to improve their skills by spending Age.  On the other hand, I imagine he'd would be all over people fucking themselves over with Frag for a quick solution to a problem. <br/><br/>Also, the MG-style succeed/failure circles replace the little clocks.  In MG, you need successes equal to your current skill or ability and then failures equal to one less than your current level in order to increase something.  At least, it's something like that (I'll have to go look it up to be sure).  The top bar of circles is for successes and the bottom bar is for failures.<br/><br/>I'll try to write up some guidelines as soon as I'm actually able to run a time combat and iron those rules out.  My thought is that every character acts independently (unlike characters in MG that act in groups) unless they specifically choose to help each other with stratagems.  But you still frame 3 actions at a time, effectively framing an entire "sweep" in Continuum-speak.  Those three actions would often be: Manuever (Oracle/Frune/Measure), Rendezvous, Attack.  But once characters started accumulating Frag or injuries, some Defend actions would probably pop up, with Feint being used by Narcs and trickier or more creative Continuum spanners.<br/><br/>The really interesting thing about time combat is that I'm hoping to play the Narcissists using the new stratagems from <i>Narcissist 0.7</i>, so the Narcs actually have goals that are perpendicular to those of the Continuum spanners.  Both sides could potentially win, in fact, with one or more Narcs succeeding at "crashing free" into another universe while the Continuum frags the fuck out of what remains of them (their junior and elder Geminis) in Swarm Prime.  This makes the Narcs more interesting and not just suicidal whackjobs.<br/><br/>Also, though, one of the other things I want to do is move away from time combat being the only major type of conflict that Continuum spanners engage in, because that seems like it could get tedious after awhile.  There are only so many Narcs, right?  So my list for possible obstacles and conflict types includes things like "Journey + Logistics," which could be like... bringing some crazy Freemason artifact from the 17th century to the 19th century.<br/><br/>In any case, those are my initial thoughts.  My major worry right now is just making sure the three independent "damage tracks" -- Disposition, Frag, and Hurt -- work okay together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199605/#Comment_199605" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T19:10:24+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  7:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><br/>In any case, those are my initial thoughts.

Mostly because:<br/>a.  I've never actually played Continuum or Mouse Guard  (though I own and love them both)<br/>b.  I haven't finished fully reading MG and I haven't read Continuum in years<br/>c.  I generally stink at remembering rules<br/><br/>Which brings me to a request...<br/>If you have time and are interested - I'd love to hear more on all your points  (and more in general)  regarding the two games and how you're combining and/or hacking them.  It would help if you explain any of the rules you're talking about modifying or at least note if a rule you mention is from MG or Continuum.  <br/><br/>No worries if you don't feel like doing that...  I can eventually fully read the books myself - but if you're interested I'd enjoy your description of said rules (and even the setting)  explained as if I'm a potential player.  The reason I ask is that I am the only one I know of in my local game gangs that enjoy either Mouse Guard or Continuum -  so I don't have anyone to chit chat with about the premise of the rules or the settings...  No one to bounce my ideas off of or hear ideas/opinions from that can help me dig deeper.<br/><br/>Like I said though - I'm just very interested and would gladly help with feedback,  but at this point I'd just be asking more questions than giving ideas...  Sorry about that.<br/><br/><br/>Lastly - I'd love to hear your opinions on the Continuum setting overall.  Any points that you'd suggest that I reread in the setting or points that you feel would be great for adventure.  When I finally run a Continuum game I am very excited just to run the "getting fragged by the missing bear" example in the book  or  just doing a simple "laundry day"  as a spanner in the house learning to span -  let alone any more action or villain oriented plots.<br/><br/><br/>and a question...

Johnathan, if you can get this actually working, I may weep for joy.  <br/><br/>I've been a <b>huge</b> fan of Continuum for years.  I've now owned two copies of the base book (loaned one away and never got it back!) and tried promising my non-existent first-born to get a copy of Narcissist.  No luck, unfortunately.<br/><br/>As wonderful as all of the concepts in the book are, however, the one time I managed to play it (at a Dreamation, actually) was rather disappointing.  A MG-hack that worked would be a wonder to behold.<br/><br/>Cobwebs are misinformation moves, right?  The example in the book is the Narcissist planting information which leads anyone performing an Oracle on them to believe their intentions are other than what they really want, yes?<br/><br/>Mechanically, in the original Continuum, you (secretly) subtract the Mind score of the Cobwebber from anyone's attempt to Oracle, and if they see through it, they know both the original information and the false.   Measures reveal the falsehood, but leave the opponent open to a physical attack -- they can be used as traps.<br/><br/>From what I can see, it would seem damage the target's disposition or Hurt.  Rather than a Independent test, a Versus seems more appropriate.  Swindle versus Investigation (Oracle) or Observation (Measure), with Fruning not working against the Cobweb.  If I can convince you my Cobweb is true, I either gain advantage over you (disposition) or lure you close enough to hit (Hurt).  If you try Fruning, I just completely sucker you (which would probably be disposition as well).<br/><br/>Are you planning on using MG's base mission-format for the rest of the game?  GM's turn, player's turn, plus checks?  <br/><br/>EDIT: Also, what's a Continuum Spanner's Nature, by your definition?  Following the Maxims?  Does that mean acting outside your Nature means acting like a Narcissist?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199654/#Comment_199654" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T05:11:39+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:11AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 5:12AM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin, I'm not sure I'm ever going to write up this hack to work for folks who haven't read or played Continuum.  That just seems like an insane amount of work.  I will have to explain the concepts and rules to my players, so there will probably be another page or two of summary ("Welcome to the Continuum!") at some point, but I can't really see doing more than that.  I have run the original Continuum a few times, once as a PBeM game that coincidentally involved Jack Aidley (Game Chef 2004 winner) called "All Tomorrow's Parties," and then a couple times at local college conventions.  Both of those were awesome thematically but unsatisfying mechanically.<br/><br/>Daniel, the way it's current set up, Cobweb is a Feint (in MG terms), along with Harbinger, which means it damages Disposition.  The problem is that Feint normally does a crap-ton of damage to Defend (Patch, Hide), gets hosed by Attacks (Hit &amp; Run, Isolate, Gemini Flush), and is resisted by Maneuver (Oracle/Frune/Measure).  And that doesn't really make as much sense for Cobweb.  Like you say, it should hose Maneuver, resist Attacks, and be independent from Defend.  I was hoping that I could avoid breaking off individual stratagems from the four categories (Attack, Defend, Maneuver, Feint) of MG, but it may not be that easy.<br/><br/>The GM turn / player turn split will probably show up in some modified form. Most likely it will go Mission -&gt; heal/refresh/player stuff -&gt; Mission.  I don't really like checks for this, but there will probably still be some hard limit on healing conditions between Missions.<br/><br/>I think the Maxims themselves should often go against a spanner's Nature.  That's part of what makes crashing so seductive and freeing.  I was going to have a spanner's Nature be defined by their Traits and Instincts.  So if you have "meek, mild-mannered, accountant" as your T&amp;I, that's also your Nature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199748/#Comment_199748" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T13:36:28+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  1:36PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon, as I said offline, an awesome thing.

I'm hoping I can try running it at SGBoston tomorrow.  Changes include:<br/><br/>-- No scripting rendezvous, instead, one automatically happens between Sweeps, when players script the next sweep.<br/>-- Stratagems mostly serve as color for the Mouse Guard action types, but do determine which skill you roll. Some do have a couple special rules.<br/>-- Frag and Harm are basically side-effects of an effective Attack (though not an effective Feint, which just damages Disposition).<br/>-- The only difference between Hit &amp; Run / Isolate / Gemini Flush is the latter two involve cooperation from other characters and geminis, respectively.<br/>-- Slipshank costs a Fate Point, not Frag (and you add it to your Yet).<br/><br/>Things I'm not sure about:<br/>-- I really want to make it possible for characters to transfer bonuses from Manuevers (Oracle/Frune/Measure) to other characters.  However, if every character is taking three actions a Sweep, that doesn't really work.  <br/>-- Maybe I should make things work MG-style, where you split the Corner into groups of 2-3 spanners, have separate goals and Dispositions for each, and then allow the effects of their actions to roll over to the player after them.  This would also help the odds problem, where a group of 6 Continuum spanners going after 1 or 2 Narcs is like shooting fish in a barrel.<br/><br/>Jason: The only bookkeeping I have in mind is keeping track of your Yet.  Honestly, I feel like that's bookkeeping enough.  The Aetherco folks have already said that tracking Geminis is being cut from the 2nd Edition, if and when that ever comes out.

No Span card at all?  So will Frag only be the result of Slipshanks and direct Attacks?  There's no way to Frag yourself or anyone else by messing with someone's Age/Yet short of an attack in Time Combat?<br/><br/>That feels like you'd lose a major component of the game.  I know it's a conversion, but the whole thing about thinking in terms of time/space rather than time &amp; space seems like a massive loss.<br/><br/>I definitely agree with dropping Gemini tracking, though.

Like, if some player writes down "Span: Living Room, 2008/2/14, 14:45:24" who's responsible for looking through all their own Spancards to see if they've Fragged themselves?  Neither the player or the GM will want to do that, so, in my experience, it doesn't happen.  Instead, what's more likely is that the GM makes general notes about what/when/where players do things and points out when they've Fragged themselves.  Spancards are pretty much only useful in determining Age (which is dumb) and tracking actions during time combat, which I think can be more easily accomplished some other way.  I might end up making a separate "conflict tracking sheet" where players mark down what/when/where they are doing, even during non-combat conflicts involving time travel, but I'll have to playtest it first to see what's necessary in that regard.<br/><br/>Some of the Aetherco folks <a href="http://www.yamara.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1389" rel="nofollow">mentioned they were working on a 2nd Edition of Continuum</a> and apparently some of the writing has been done.  Rumor is it's going to be a POD hardcover through a company like Lulu.  No word yet on Narcissist, but it may be delayed until after Continuum comes back into print, honestly.  The playtest versions of Narcissist released up until this point (0.5, 0.7, 0.9) have not really been stand-alone games, so they probably need the original game to be available before they release the supplement.<br/><br/>I'll definitely post anything I prep or learn from the playtest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199895/#Comment_199895" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T06:21:14+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  6:21AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnathan:<br/><br/>When you put it that way, I guess you're right.

It was a lot harder than I expected to run, partially because it wasn't nearly as fresh.<br/><br/><b>The Good</b><br/><br/>- Having a PC mentor (like MG Patrol Leader) was awesome and clearly how this game needs to work.<br/>- Having PCs of varying levels of Span seemed totally fine, not that weird at all.<br/>- Time Combat worked so damn smooth, wow.  Yay for breaking up stratagems into Attack/Defend/Manu/Feint.<br/>- Two groups of 3 Spanners took out two Narcs in a single sweep. "Overwhelming sentient force" indeed.<br/>- Not keeping track of a span card was no problem at all.<br/>- While it started out a bit weak, the players seemed to be having a good time by the end.<br/><br/><b>The Not So Good</b><br/><br/>- Six players was probably way too many for a basic playtest.  We had a Span 3 mentor, a Span 2 Quicker agent as second-in-command, three Span 1 newbies, and Neil who played a Span 0 hitman recently Invited to Dance.<br/>- Running character creation for a one-shot was a royal pain but it was good to try it once to see what stuff I need to improve.<br/>- I need to develop guidelines for prepping the GM's Turn for this game.  My improvised stuff just wasn't cutting it.<br/>- Likewise, I need to develop antagonist-burning rules for making Narcs and such.  My two meddlers got their asses handed to them.<br/>- I didn't do a great job of setting up the GM Turn / Player Turn distinction, which I think is more important for MG-based one-shots.  Having the characters wandering around trying stuff out might work in MG games where the players and GM are tight, but this was a bit too loose.<br/><br/><b>Stuff We Didn't Get to Try Out</b><br/><br/>- Time combat was the only type of extended conflict we ran.  I'd really love to see the other ones, like "Journey" etc.<br/>- We forgot to try out the Frag / Harm rules, which was too bad.<br/>- We didn't have any Geminis or Yet stuff, because I was improvising too much to remember that stuff.<br/><br/>All in all, a worthwhile experiment and something I'm looking forward to working on a running some more in the future, probably after I move to Seattle in a month or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214644/#Comment_214644" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T03:04:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  3:04AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff Jonathan.

This looks really cool though.  The GM and players turns are all about tension in my MG games though.  You need a situation for the GM turn that has to happen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right now</span> and there will be dire consequences if you don't address it.  The players turn is all about how to I leverage what I just did to my agenda or set myself and team up for more success in the future.  <br/><br/>So, when the Yet is going crazy and death and destruction are on the line, GM turn.  When they have time to breath and 'do' their own stuff, Players turn.  All you have to have is a set of plot situations set up and run with it.  The game nearly runs itself.

Our Span 0 leveler hitman became a Span 1 after a single conflict over his Invitation, so we probably should have just stated him up as a Span 1 from the beginning.  It may be that Span 0 isn't really functional in game for very long, except for NPCs. The problem with bringing in Age is the life-extension stuff that happens at higher Span levels really throws effective Age out the window. I'll think about your suggestion though, as I prep for more playtesting. Even if I end up sticking with something more like what I have here, my intent with this hack is to build the guidelines for a campaign that I'm gonna run.  I fully expect other folk to make adjustments and so forth based on their own needs, so if you wanna hack in some Age-based spanner burning rules when you run it, you should totally do that.  <br/><br/>Scott, totally.  I definitely <i>should</i> have run the GM's Turn that way.  Like, "Uh, shit, I guess you've been fragged, so you're in Time Combat" or "you really need to get this mysterious box to 1892 without drawing any attention to yourselves, because there's some folk after it, so... Journey/Caper conflict and if you fail, Time Combat."  And then the Player's Turn should have been for player-directed stuff, but I was being a bit too weasel-y because it was a playtest and I wasn't fully confident in it.  Hopefully it'll work better next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214910/#Comment_214910" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T15:20:36+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  3:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>if you wanna hack in some Age-based spanner burning rules when you run it, you should totally do that.</blockquote>\nI admit I was already considering rule ideas like "For Instant Skills, make a Span test (ob = New Skill Level). If you fail, decrease your Health by one." (Because, as you say, higher Span people have access to those nice age-reducing treatments, so they're more able to afford spending long stretches of time practicing or training. Although maybe, at a certain point, you should get the option of reducing Mental instead of Health?)<br/><br/>Although I also like the "Get a point of Frag, which you only get rid of by making the necessary number of checks to actually learn the new skill in question" method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214915/#Comment_214915" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T15:42:30+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  3:42PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, right now I'm treating instant skills as a form of slipshank, basically along the lines you mention, but it hasn't really been tested yet.

Narcs will probably also have special strategems like "Pocket" that allow slipshank on a level that Continuum spanners can't really perform or explain ("Hey, I just brought back a duplicate of myself, so you can kill him off while I remain very much alive" or "hey, where did I get this live dinosaur from? oops").  This will probably eventually clue the players into the fact that the Continuum isn't telling them everything, leading to even more hijinks.<br/><br/>In any case, I want to make sure their conflict goals are clear and there's actually something cool that happens if they succeed, aside from them simply getting away and reappearing later on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214932/#Comment_214932" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T16:36:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  4:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please post some of this over at the BW-MG forums.   <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=47" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=47</a><br/><br/>Thanks.
