Are you only talking about games being played more because people payed for them? That's probably bullcrap. But commercial games are probably played more because people look for their new games in stores, because many people won't read game PDFs, but only books, and so on. And I think there are many people who are just plain suspicious of free games, because it's very easy to put a game out there that's crap, but if you publish it in a book, you really have to believe in it.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't have any <i>data</i>.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, did you mean assuming the person in question has downloaded the game and read it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178936/#Comment_178936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T01:21:51+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  1:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really need any convincing that there are factors surrounding commercial games that give them higher visibility then free games.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a convincing argument that if the only factor changed by the distributor of a game were lowering its price, it would be see less play by people other than the creator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178937/#Comment_178937" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T02:08:21+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  2:08AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted over in another thread that I think its a matter of consumers being spoilt for choice and choosing what they think are higher quality products, on the assumption that non-free products had higher production costs (true for print items at least), and that is some sort of assurance of better quality.<br/><br/>i.e. if someone is going to stump up the money to print and retail their game, and the front to charge money for it, then the chances of it being playtested, functional, and complete, as opposed to badly designed and throwaway, are raised.<br/><br/>I don't believe this is always true. There are fabulous free games, there are atrocious non-free games.

In Finland American indie games are usually only noted in media and by retailers if they're for sale. This is because retailers (me) won't import and represent free games at conventions, and because free games have not been productized - packaged, branded, quality-controlled and clearly published as an event that is news-worthy. Thus free games are only ever even mentioned in discussion when one such happens to hit the exact bullseye of relevance for some particular conversation.<br/><br/>If you want your free game to get over this hump, consider putting out a print version that you sell at-cost to retailers, who can then get a modest profit for selling your game to others. Also make a point of putting your game up on a nice website, making it nice-looking and finishing it in a clear manner that signals a completed product instead of an on-going and unfinished project. And think up some marketing material and some ritual of commitment for people who want to get the game to entice curiousity. All of these will help your game compete with for-pay products.<br/><br/>Personally I think that there is no reason for a "free game" (as in, a game that does not produce profit for the publisher) to not gain a similar opportunity on the market that a for-pay game gets. It's just that usually a person publishing a free game is really saying that he's not interested in pushing his game to the degree that the other guy is - he's already giving up on venues of sales and marketing strategies the other guy takes for granted, such as retailers, webstores, press releases, guarantees of quality and all sorts of other stuff, and he's not really taking up any new methods the other guy isn't also using for his own project. Of course your game is going to get played less if your marketing plan is to not market at all; and that is surprisingly common when "for free" is code for "can't stand the heat" or "no faith in my project" or "couldn't care less".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178942/#Comment_178942" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T05:09:44+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  5:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 5:10AM by J_Walton.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely think it's really code for "games without an outreach / marketing plan get played less," which should be a kinda "duh" moment.  I definitely disagree with Eero's comment that "free" often means "doesn't care," but it does often mean "I don't really want to have to deal with all that crap."  After all, who gets a booth at GenCon to promote a free product?  I mean, besides me, of course <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Marketing requires a lot of time and, potentially, money, that often doesn't get invested in free products because the author doesn't see the likelihood of making any return.  Efforts to promote sales do often line up with efforts to promote play or recognition of the game itself.<br/><br/>However, I also think that we could do a much better job of promoting free games as real, legitimate products and, consequently, promoting free releases as a potential publishing option that most people don't normally consider for "real" (whatever that means) projects.  That was one of my intents with <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/free-game-valhalla/" rel="nofollow">Free Game Valhalla</a>.  Additionally, thanks to marketing efforts and the support of people who really dig the game, <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter</a> has seen a lot more play than most unfinished (probably 15 games with 12 AP posts, and it's still in beta) free games that I can think of -- the exceptions being outside playtests of big mainstream products like Pathfinder.  So there are ways around some of this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178943/#Comment_178943" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T05:31:49+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  5:31AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you, Jonathan.

The assumption being that they wouldn't have done that if they (at least) weren't convinced they had a game of quality and that the desire to at least recapture their expense would ensure that they would release the highest quality game they could.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course with the ability to put any old thing on Lulu for essentially nothing, this is less compelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course there are free games that are of superior quality and for sale games with large print runs that are drek.  But the existance of exceptions does not disprove trends.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso games that are for sale tend to have greater information about them more readily available making it easier to filter the world of for sale games into "games I might be interested in" then it is to filter the world of free games.  More effective filters means that you're more likely to be pleased with a higher proportion of games looked at...which gives additional edge to for sale games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178951/#Comment_178951" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T07:04:43+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  7:04AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite><br>I haven't seen a convincing argument that if the only factor changed by the distributor of a game were lowering its price, it would be see less play by people other than the creator.</br></blockquote>\nI think free games get played a lot less but even I don't think this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178956/#Comment_178956" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T07:38:43+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  7:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite><br>I haven't seen a convincing argument that if the only factor changed by the distributor of a game were lowering its price, it would be see less play by people other than the creator.</br></blockquote>\nIs anyone saying this?<br><br>As for me, I'm not saying "don't price your game low."

I think the "alt dungeon" genre is especially effective in this regard, because the market is already there and there are plenty of people looking for new takes on an old staple.  Likewise, I think Geiger's relative success comes from the same existing among fans of horror / monster-fighting games.  It's also interesting, I think, that many folks who try out things like DS, RBH, and Geiger are working on their own "alt dungeon" or "alt horror" game, and are picking up these free games to see what other folks are doing, whether to steal ideas or just see how other folks handle the same issues.  So, in that regard, I think the free games that have seen some extended play definitely feed into this consume-but-also-create loop. Ben Robbins, for example, keeps generating cool alternate rules for Geiger Counter and those guys Jason mentioned are doing their own crazy stuff with Dungeon Squad. That's the sweet sweetness right there, for sure.<br><br>You see the same thing, I think, in the desperately-seeking-the-best-kungfu-fight-system-in-the-world crowd that gave us Wushu and that ilk, even though Wushu is nominally commercial.  How many folks who buy Weapons of the Gods or Mist-Robed Gate also have their own martial arts system on the backburner?  I'd say at least 75% of them.  Free games that can tap into that kind of interest definitely have legs.<br><br>P.S. Geiger Counter started life as an Afraid (also free!) hack, so it owes it's existence to this kind of free trade in awesome.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178959/#Comment_178959" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T08:01:28+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  8:01AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry in advance for the digression:  Ben's 100% right about pricing appropriately if you care about getting your thing out there - look to the Names Project as a dumb counter-example of "selliing at cost" shooting a project in the foot.

One of those ways is to commit to actions that would be simply insane if he didn't genuinely believe in his product, such as producing an expensive print run. The message is then further compounded by showing signs of experience and competence which make it even more unlikely that this guy is just stupid and mistaken in his belief that his game is good enough to warrant a commitment of funds.<br/><br/>Perhaps a free game should be made into a stream video or some other sort of low-barrier thing that doesn't require the commitment of time and interest that the written form requires. By lowering the barriers of entry you make the initial signs less important for choosing to commit to looking at the product. I for one know that often enough I don't look at a free game simply because I can't be bothered to find the download link on the webpage, or wait for the free file host to divulge the file, or whatever other barriers the publisher has provided - and even if I get the file, I still need to read it, which is not at all entertaining if the game is not good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178962/#Comment_178962" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T08:16:02+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  8:16AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Now your question can be addressed anecdotally.

But for many, perception is reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese aren't my opinions, but rather what I've collected from the 150+ gamer community in NY and NJ that I am closely connected to. Free games are played less because:<br/>\n<br/>\n- no print version<br/>\n- no representation in game stores<br/>\n- no reviews / actual play<br/>\n- no fiction to read<br/>\n- no art<br/>\n- no marketing / awareness / advertising / publicity / buzz<br/>\n- no representation at conventions<br/>\n- no quality control<br/>\n- no character sheets<br/>\n- no community<br/>\n- no playtesting<br/>\n- no blind playtesting with a wide assortment of people with different backgrounds or different size groups<br/>\n- too many free games, no clear way to filter the good from bad<br/>\n- no consistent product support<br/>\n- no barrier to entry as a filter<br/>\n- no outside editing<br/>\n- previous bad experience with free games or even free software (it's interesting how the 2 are lumped together with some people)<br/>\n- incomplete products or products that are constantly changing<br/>\n- no offline representation<br/>\n- "even I could do that, if I want a free game I will just make one"<br/>\n- time is money, how much time will I need to spend figuring out how this works?<br/>\n- could be gone tomorrow<br/>\n- no useable layout or graphic design<br/>\n- secret agenda: if the game is good, why not charge money? how else are they making their money? will it cost money later?<br/>\n- only 1 person involved, no checks or balances<br/>\n- without the pressure to sell, designers design for themselves, not their audience<br/>\n- many people acquire games to collect them, without a physical reminder or pressure of investment, they are often forgotten<br/>\n- many people acquire games just for few rule snippets to use in their other games, without a physical reminder or pressure of investment, they are often forgotten<br/>\n- potential usage of stolen software<br/>\n- a large percentage of the audience is composed of designers or future designers with a fear that giving too much away for free kills their dream of doing this for money one day (even though the likelihood that they will make money themselves may be non-existent)<br/>\n- anti-capitalist: if it has value, we should pay for it<br/>\n- class warfare: if a game does equal the production values of a commercial release, where is the publisher getting their money from? are they paying their artists? are they rich and taking away opportunities from the middle class?<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, many consider free to not be limited to products that we pay for with money. If we pay for it via exposure to advertising, it isn't free. Additionally, people I've spoken to have less problems with free games that are open source with some clear and easy way to contribute than they do with free games that are NOT open source.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all being said, the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com" rel="nofollow">imagination sweatshop's</a> free game <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?p=36" rel="nofollow">Trial and Terror</a> has received quite a bit of play. Eppy, Jim, and Jason playstormed it, playtested it with several different people, laid it out, added art (some of it very professional), printed it, and gave it away on Free RPG day as well as made it available for free as a PDF. It's fully playable but not a final version yet. I believe they are determining what next steps to take with it in the coming weeks. The power of community and group effort is amazing! But there are limits to where it can be taken without a budget. But it's a great example of a free game with high standards. As is Geiger Counter. Has everyone heard of these free games? Have you played them? If you have the time, interest, and access to players, why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178966/#Comment_178966" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T08:25:39+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  8:25AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If you have the time, interest, and access to players, why not?</blockquote>\nThere's the question, right?

An investment, trust that the game works, access to tools that make play easier, but I think most importantly having 1-2 friends eager to play as well is what will usually motivate me. How to get people interested in play is a combination of factors, one of the biggest simply being awareness (not just that the game exists but why it is good and why others outside of the designers are excited about it).

It's really noticeable, and I could pile up tons of anecdotal "evidence" to back up the fact that people don't play free games as much or as often as they go games they've paid for.  Joel's point about hardcopy is important too, since I can't run a game from a PDF unless I print and bind it, but that's not the whole story.<br><br>The only conclusion I've been able to come up with it that of investment: that is, roleplayers "invest" in the games they play and run, mentally, financially and emotionally.  There's a basic human problem that we can't easily walk away from something we've invested too much it.<br><br>So you get a game you paid, say, \xa315 for.  It's 100 pages, but before you even crack the cover, you're \xa315 invested in that game.  If you read it, you're 100 pages + \xa315 invested.  You're more likely to read it than, say, the 100 page free game you downloaded because you have no investment at all in that free game.  Unless you've invested time chatting about it online, or you've played it or you know the author.  If you read both, you're 100 pages invested in the free game and 100 pages + \xa315 invested in the one you bought, so, yeah, you're \xa315 more likely to run the game you paid for.  I'm not saying you'll be playing the game you bought every time, but the freebie will have to be <i>\xa315 better</i> than the game you paid for for you to feel as invested in it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178982/#Comment_178982" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T09:33:46+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  9:33AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I definitely think perceptions can and will change. I think ultimately that's what this all comes down to, perception (with awareness being a prerequisite).<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people locally were iffy on playstorming as a process because of perception in the business world that group think meetings, decision by consensus, and creativity by majority often leads to lackluster results. And in the business world it often does! But the playstorming process doesn't work this way (you have a leader per game and just like brainstorming, you come up with many ideas that later the leader sorts through but isn't shackled by). But the more people that got involved, the more people were excited by it! But playstorming has limited resources to alter perception. It can still be done. Just slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow fast perceptions change is very hard to say. Many people believe things that if they simply went to one of the many online fact check sites would realize are untrue. You see this in politics all the time. That's one of the reasons so many politicians are either very wealthy themselves, have many corporate sponsors, or raise large amounts of money to be contenders. They need the money to reach people. And often hearing a message once isn't enough, you need to hear it many times, from many different angles, and have your friends and family tell you about it as well. Money and rewards tied to success are great ways to motivate people or pay for services that can help further these causes. Money certainly isn't the only way. It just can push things forward quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think if we could clone you it would help the cause! I see you very much as a renaissance man. You are passionate, put your resources where your mouth is, are building your own brand, hooked in, talented, adaptable, motivated, and able to pick up a wide variety of skills to do the work of multiple people. That's special. Much of the list above doesn't apply to you. In my own limited perception, free games and Jonathan's free games are two very separate categories!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178986/#Comment_178986" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T09:46:10+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  9:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 9:47AM by jenskot.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking about perception and politics for second, let's take Prop 8 in California. I don't want to turn this into a for or against specific politics conversation. It just helps illustrate some of these points. Many people believe that many of those voting on Prop 8 didn't fully understand what they were voting for. Check out: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.protectmarriage.com/</a> The people behind this website made Prop. 8 more about "protecting children" than "restoring marriage". <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/video/view/6" rel="nofollow">This video is the crux of their argument...</a> Which is full of misinformation. Their argument is that if you keep gay marriage legal, then children will have to learn about gay marriage as early as second grade in public school before they have enough of an understanding to make up their own minds. Citing one case in Massachusetts. It's a compelling argument. But Prop. 8 only says: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." Even if Prop. 8 is passed, under California law, "domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits" as married spouses. So public schools could simply teach their kids about gay partnerships. Prop. 8 doesn't solve the problems they are pointing to. And those problems don't even exist as California law gives guardians broad authority to remove their children from any health instruction if it conflicts with their religious beliefs or moral convictions. But the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.protectmarriage.com/</a>  website is waaaay better than the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.noonprop8.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noonprop8.com/</a> Even just calling it protect marriage . com and having "protecting Californian children" with cute pictures on the top is way better than noonprop8.com with its scary red letters in bad HTML text saying "unfair. wrong". protectmarriage.com even has resources and fliers in a wide assortment of languages: Spanish, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Hmong, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Laotian, Polish, Samoan, Farsi, Pashto, and Punjabi. Damn! The people for pop 8 were able to raise incredible amounts of money.

Yes, there are definitely higher standards that free games could aspire to, but there are also a lot of perceptions that are outdated or just don't hold up to scrutiny. By "changing perceptions" I meant doing so both by giving people new information about existing products and by giving people products that transcend those complaints.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>To clarify, when you are playtesting, your motive isn't 100% enjoyment - you have other motives and other needs to address.</blockquote>\n100%, really? By that standard, I don't know that I've ever actually "played" a game.  In my experience, I guess, the line between play and playtesting is pretty vague.  If a playtest goes really well, such that I'm more focused on enjoying the game than trying out these freaky new mechanics, it pretty much stops being a playtest and becomes play, no?  Consequently, the requirement for a game being linked on Free Game Valhalla is closely related: if a group of players unconnected to the game's author play the game and <i>would play it again without changing any of the printed rules</i> then it's viable and considered "good enough."  That's where play stops being playtesting for me, if I'm focused on the game, not where it's potentially busted.<br><br>John, I am flattered by your comments, but I honestly don't think I'm doing anything that other people couldn't.  Most indie game designer-publishers can and have done everything that I'm doing and more.<br><br>As a counter-example to a lot of the stuff that's been talked about, here's some games that I've acquired and/or played in the past few years without buying them:<br><br>- I'm currently playing Bliss Stage and I got my copy free from Ben for participating in one of his playtest groups<br>- I've played a ton of Primetime Adventures through SGBoston, run by people who've never seen a copy, playing with groups in which every person there has never seen a copy; instead the game was transmitted virally, as a series of procedures that were spread between various people<br>- I've ran 3:16 (and subsequently some other folks ran more of it) due to Gregor sending the PDF to the other participants in the Design Matters booth<br>- I have a copy of the Mist-Robed Gate PDF because I helped Shreyas with the layout<br>- I have a copy of the Exalted PDF because they were giving it away for free on Drive-Thru for about a week<br>- I've acquired several games by trading other designers print copies of Push 1; I've thought about doing this with the Geiger Counter PDF, despite the fact that it's already free; it would be interesting to see how that goes<br>- Bizarrely, in my last IPR order I got a copy of Supers Battlegrounds for the Hero System (WTF?)<br><br>None of these were things that I did intentionally, because I wanted to get free games.  They just happened.  If I was really working at this, I might never have to buy a game ever again.  Even most commercial indie products I could probably get by mailing the author a box full of homemade fudge or something, yeah?

If you think about it, a person who is strongly committed to having his game played and willing to use many means to make that happen is rather unlikely to be acting this way while simultaneously being willing to do it without monetary compensation and the prestige value of being good enough to ask for money. Thus, in the field of all published games, there is a discernible bias for worthwhile games to be for-pay. This bias might not initially even be very large, but it is big enough to be discerned by the playing public, and consequently magnified as it becomes received wisdom that for-pay games are better. This established knowledge then further strengthens the original bias of good games likely being for-pay, as the serious designers opt to associate with the positive image instead of the negative one and thus choose to ask money for their games. The end-result of the process is what we have: there's nothing inherent in making a free game that would force the game to be worse, but there are enough reasons for a strong bias of expectation to exist in general. Thus each free game has this additional hurdle of believability to get over before the prospective audience gives it a chance.<br/><br/>This is not unlike making a game without any art, to pick an example. That doesn't make a game any worse objectively speaking by itself, but it's another signal that is associated with a non-serious slapdash job (or perhaps amateurish and low-budget, like happened with <i>Fastlane</i>), and will therefore act as a damper to your marketing signal. Any and all production choices can be analyzed in this regard: how will your target audience's positive and negative expectations line up with the product itself? Many of those expectations have nothing to do with your own product, but they're right often enough to be preserved as part of the overall zeitgeist.<br/><br/>To continue with the example, Jonathan and others interested in changing the image of free games might think in terms of cutting losses and dividing the field by forming some sort of alternate concept for why a game might be free. Take <i>Spione</i>, which has no art: the reason for this not being any sort of problem for the game is that it situates itself as a non-gamebook to begin with, and an essay collection about Berlin and the cold war is not exactly something you'd expect to be amply illustrated with chicks in bikini or other atmospheric illustration. So a trait that would have been negative in a different cultural context becomes a matter of course for a different sort of product. What would be the context in which being free would not only be value-neutral, but also expected?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179020/#Comment_179020" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T14:01:11+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  2:01PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's not that you play the games you buy.

So in the end, it's more like a total cost of $4-10 for complete games, or $2-5 for existing RPG supplements (note: existing RPG supplement == fan supplement for existing product, unlicensed == technically illegal, but so are all doujin comics. But the point on "complete games" still stand, those are original games).<br/><br/>Here's a listing of recent Doujin (indie) RPGs that a popular gaming store in Hiroshima carries (they scour the doujin/comic conventions for the interesting-looking indie games, then sell a few copies in store on a kind of consignment). You can tell the range of quality by the covers alone, from "colorful gloss" to "hand-drawn pencil and photocopied":<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/doujin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/doujin.htm</a><br/><br/>Most of them at the store price are priced at $6-10. At the Komiket/Comic Market they'd be about $4-8 each.<br/><br/>Sorry, kind of tangential to the thread.  Some of these makers, not all of them, also offer the entire text of their games on their website for free... but as "internet talk" happens, they don't seem to be talked about as much as the for-purchase games.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179024/#Comment_179024" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T14:11:08+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  2:11PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/the-thing-about.html" rel="nofollow">Seth Godin on free</a><br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179027/#Comment_179027" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T15:09:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  3:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 3:11PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, you're totally right that finding "some other reason" for games to be free would be useful.  Like, uh, not actually having game books at all and just disseminating games as practices.  That would be hot.  I've been trying to convince folks to get excited about that, but have had zero takers so far.  Do you have any suggestions?  <br/><br/>Another one of my plans is to encourage folks to ditch the mass (ha!) market entirely and simply distribute games locally and through personal contacts.  Like, if I put my PDF on the internet and Jason downloads it, the likelihood of him playing it is not large.  BUT!  If I print out a copy, even a photocopy stapled booklet style, and hand it to him at a convention while gazing deeply into his eyes and saying, "Jason, I think you'd really like this..." the odds go WAY up, right?  (Psst, that was my secret plan for Geiger Counter at GenCon, but it didn't really work because I ended up not being able to go). Plus, I have this theory that you don't need a *lot* of people playing your game for it to really take off; you just need the *right* people, which advertising agencies have realized for a while.  Another one of the other ways that free really works is making it socially rewarding to produce products for limited, specific audiences (like: your friends).  Selling 20 copies of a game to your friends makes you seem like a money-grubbing leech. Giving them away makes you awesome.  And then maybe your friends will share it with other people, but if you're happy with a limited, local distribution, that's just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>That "earning the right to a transaction" stuff is really good, Paul.

I think Jonathan is insane but inspired and I admire inspired because I do some pretty insane inspired stuff too.  But as a data point for this thread, I think "done" is a big issue for me.  I often don't play free games because I can't tell what stage of development they're in and I don't really like playing games that aren't done.<br/><br/>I have played The Pool and loved it because its design was done.  As a game text it's incomplete but play wise it's great.<br/><br/>That's why over at <a href="http://bloodthornpress.com" rel="nofollow">Bloodthorn Press</a> where I've currently put everything up I've created for free, I have clear stages of development listed.  Right now everything is Alpha.  Silent Sound in a few weeks will be promoted to a new category of playtesting.  And although my end goal is sales, delineating those stages of development would be really important to me even if they were ultimately going to be free.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179030/#Comment_179030" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T15:35:04+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  3:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>What would be the context in which being free would not only be value-neutral, but also expected?</blockquote>\nOr, in other words, why else would one make his game free if not because he doesn't have the knowhow and confidence to make a product for sale?<br/><br/>One form of free games that might have potential in combating preconceptions are the open source projects that try to emulate the free software phenomenon. The reason for why freeness works in this context is that it's elevated into a matter of ideology: nobody would think that your game is below-average or unfinished <i>because</i> it's free when the freeness of the game is very much a central rallying cry of the endeavour. Unfortunately failed projects of this sort have done a lot to poison this particular well: at least my first reaction to a "free and open game design community with the purpose of creating the super rpg to rule all rpgs", after having witnessed this sort of thing several times, is to assume that the guy running the project is a professional in the software field and is just messing with rpgs on a hobby level, and doesn't really have any sort of expertise in this different field. The results have always dried up and been mediocre due to design by committee and no real goalposts, just like happens with many software projects that try to work in this manner, too.<br/><br/>Another potentially fruitful context, as Jonathan quite clearly elucidates, is living practice. I'm doing this right now here in Sonkaj\xe4rvi, as I'm running a fantasy rpg of my own creation for some teenagers, of which one has already asked me to teach him how to run the game, which only exists as some random blog notes and in my head. I did not create the game to publish it but to play, but nobody who's encountered it can really doubt the quality of the game in the way an Internet-encountered free game gets doubted. However, cultural evolution is against this sort of thing: my game would have to be fucking amazing, the best thing since <i>Dragonlance</i>, for it to spread to wider audiences in any real manner by merely playing it and waiting for others to pick it up in a lineage of transmit. Still, larps work like this, having individual techniques spread by people visiting in each other's games: nobody judges a larp based on whether its text is for-pay; we can't really say yet if this is a transitory phase, though, as there's not yet any real scene for larp texts to begin with. Most larpers write some notes, but these are only rarely intended for replay by others. Even actual play reports are usually private.<br/><br/>Yet another out-there idea to combat the preconception would be to set yourself up as a GM for hire. That takes the sort of balls that pretty much strike the typical preconceptions out of the water. Just present your web page not as "this is a game I made with my friends" but as "I'm a professional GM for hire, and this is the game I'm going to run, because it's just that good". Even if this might situate your commercial product to fail (being that nobody's pulled off commercial GMing yet), it well might provide a fruitful context for your game - people are going to take it seriously if it's the chosen system of a professional GM. You could do this stratagem with other sorts of product (heck, sell special dice only used by your game) and you wouldn't actually ever need to sell very well for the game itself to gain the prestigious aura of commercial endeavour while still staying free.<br/><br/>I'm sure others have other ideas for how to recontextualize the game in this manner. Almost anything is better than "I have this game here for free, and I don't want to say it, but it's pretty clear that if it were any good I'd have already produced it for commerce". Even exclaiming how you're not interested in money comes off as a lame excuse in this context, as that disinterest is so easily interpreted as a lack of passion and ambition, a lack of commitment to providing the best product you can. You need something more solid than empty words to make another person believe you when you decide to go free and want to convince them that it's not because you lack confidence and ambition.<br/><br/>However, combating the preconceptions is still just one half of the fight, as you still have to do the soul-seeking and planning related to your factual marketing efforts. As I said up above, the original and primary reason for free games being less known than commercial games is that the publisher of the free game made his game free to avoid the commitment to marketing a commercial game requires. This is a set-up for obscurity, so even if you recontextualize your game to get rid of the impressions this obscure niche has gathered over the years, you'll still need to figure out separately what sort of marketing you want to make to reach that audience you want. Not getting relegated to the same box with all the other free games in the Internet of course helps, but that alone won't make the game popular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179032/#Comment_179032" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T15:48:35+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  3:48PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 3:49PM by Sean Musgrave.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal anecdotal evidence indicates that free games do get played just as much, vis me playing them, friends introducing me to them, and playing them at conventions. Not to say that that anecdotal evidence isn't bollocks, but there's nothing that says your anecdotal evidence isn't bollocks as well.<br/><br/>I don't understand how stocking at traditional roleplaying/minis/comic book stores would lead to people to actually playing a game using the rules in the book. They're filled with books that are nigh on unplayable.

Also, though, as I kinda outlined in the last post, there are an bunch of other marketing and distribution options that emerge if you don't assume that the goal is *numbers*, that is, getting the most people possible to have or play your game.  If your goal is the *right people* or if your goal is *150 people in the Boston area* things get really different.  Like, imagine if Luke's goal was to get 50% of the population of New York City to 1) have heard of the Burning Wheel and 2) know that it was a game.  He could take out a full page ad in the NYTimes, try to get on the local news, etc.  It would be a totally different approach than trying to get gamers to buy copies of the game and play it.  We have such low impact on a large scale (lots of effort for little result), but can have such a strong impact on a small scale.  I think there's definitely interesting things you can do in a small market.  Like, how many thousands of people live in the city of Boston?  Why do I need to focus on marketing my game on the internet or at conventions, to people far away, if I can have a much stronger impact here, directly?  I mean, clearly a mixture of various approaches is probably the way to go, but there are a lot of interesting things that haven't really been explored yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179042/#Comment_179042" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T17:23:45+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  5:23PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I totally agree with you on that, Jonathan. Especially so when you consider my viewpoint up here in Finland: the stuff I do here in the Internet is just the tip of the iceberg, most of my rpg hobby is all about operating in this 5 million people market that is in some ways pretty secluded from the rest of the world. And it's not like I'm alone here, we have something like half a dozen rpg designers here who would qualify as Forge regulars in terms of output, personal time investment and artistic ambition. Ever since Ron told me that Chicago has as many people as the whole of Finland (yeah, I knew it intellectually, but hadn't thought about it) I've been wondering why you guys in your big cities don't operate more on the local level - the sort of grassroots marketing we do here to attract a hundred people should by rights get you several thousand as the very minimum in a city the size of a midling country.<br/><br/>Considering the mileage I get out of local activity here in Upper Savo where my local audience is something like a whopping 30 000 people if I count the closest city, I guess I'd just focus near exclusively on local projects if I lived somewhere where the city I lived in could factually support my sort of art just like that. Here "well connected" and "appreciated by community" means subventions of travel and location costs and the occasional opportunities to talk to parents and school classes about gaming and game industry; I can't see how a population base of several million people wouldn't translate into a worthwhile local career for somebody willing to put their mind into it, even in something as niche as gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>"Free games get played less" - Why do you believe

I'm not saying you'll be playing the game you bought every time, but the freebie will have to be<i>\xa315 better</i>than the game you paid for for you to feel as invested in it.</blockquote>\nHell, yes. <i>This</i>, right here.<br/><br/>The investment phenomenon is frikkin' <i>powerful.</i> Like, in my regular game group, we play a lot of D&amp;D. Many players have invested in book upon book of 3.5 D&amp;D. There are a few of us who don't prefer and even have serious issues with D&amp;D (even one who regularly GMs it because that's what the group likes), but fighting that tide of investment is nearly impossible. So we play a lot of D&amp;D. Our second-string game is Big Eyes Small Mouth. it's the preferred system of the GM who doesn't like D&amp;D, and she runs a campaign in that from time to time. But the investment, group-wide, is small. One couple co-owns the main book and a supplement or two, and another player has their own core book. Compare that with the <i>hundreds</i> of dollars and <i>many thousands</i> of reading-hours invested in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>It's no contest. We don't play D&amp;D exclusively, but D&amp;D predominates both the game-at-table slot and the group's shared dialogue about roleplaying. Even the GM who doesn't like D&amp;D so much is just in <i>love</i> with her Book of Nine Swords she picked up, plus Book of Exalted Deeds plus the Dragonomicon, and so forth. . .which adds investment and shapes dialogue. It's harder and harder for me to even talk about games I'd like to play, as our group investment becomes more calcified into this form that doesn't really admit of many of those games' paradigms. I'm not even sure what kind of environment would facilitate paradigm shift to allow for a wider scope of gaming at this point.<br/><br/>(to be fair, it's not all gloomy; the GM I was just talking about thinks Shadow of Yesterday sounds really neat, f'rinstance. But she says it in a "yeah, that'd be nice to play, someday, perhaps, if we get some of these D&amp;D campaigns of our plate and just happen to feel like trying something new" way. Not so much a "So Joel, when are you going to run us a Shadow of Yesterday game" way.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, I'm not sure where these observations fit into the conversation as evolved, but y'all are going too fast for me anyway, so I'll just let this be (probably) a diverting footnote.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179107/#Comment_179107" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T07:45:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  7:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run a game of Geiger Counter and a few games of On Mighty Thews at Italian conventions.

I just played Archipelago, Until We Sink, and a test version of Fiasco. Which a really great games, and have repeat play value, but are also ones which I'd be very much okay with playing only once or at widely sperated times with a different group.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I want to get at is how an indie mind set on selling can work against these games being played. Let's just say that, for this example, people do in fact value what they pay for more than something free. OTOH, there are certain minimum requirements combined with pricing issues that are very delicately balanced. Maybe I won't pay $2 for a game; At that amount it's almost as bad as being a free game, in terms of getting to the public. here the price is too low for whatever reason.<br/><br/>Worse, I won't pay $5-10 for a 12 page game, either. weird, but true.<br/><br/>Well, what's a possible answer.<br/><br/>One is padding. Here, the designer adds content or even complexity to flesh out page count ( which has both positive and negative aspects). I seem to see this a good bit with smaller indie games ( some of which I have a great deal of respect for). Now the designer is reaching my "Worth the money" point. Unfortunately, the same additions may actually start to interfere with ease-of-use, which I consider to be a huge positive.<br/><br/>Another possibility is bundling multiple games. this is the one that seems to run head-on into the indie ideal of creator control. Theoretically, a single designer could put together several short games in a package and sell them together. Otoh, svereal different gamers by different designers in a package maymake more sense and give a real variety of takes on this format. However, this anthology style of product is a control and money nightmare.<br/><br/>The answer would seem to be to simply have some one person buy the publishing rights for those games, then put the thing out...which goes directly in the opposite direction of creator control.<br/><br/>Blarg!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179144/#Comment_179144" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:27:01+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The bundling of lots of short games would also tend to devalue each additional game, yeah?

And further, those two or three short pieces that make it worthwhile are different for different readers with some possible overlappings of interest.<br/><br/>I think you'd almost inherently see an overlap of vocabulary and structure, especially if Collection X had an editor pulling it together, as necessarily the games chosen will reflect the interests of that editor/compiler.<br/><br/>One thing that might be interesting in something like that is the possibility of a creator going really directly for the game they want to make, assuming up front that an intersted reader will almost certainly use that game as a jumping off point to create their own variations, and because of that many of the things we see in longer rule-sets are simply unnecessary.<br/><br/>As a quickie, f'rinstance example, if Jason M. was to put something like Fiasco into that format, I might expect that he'd shoot directly to a preset game and skip the set-up rolling. Yeah, that would undercut some of the fun at the core of creating the set up, but it would shoot straight to the essence of the actual game play.<br/><br/>Edit:How far along you can go without turning it into Story-Game Tee-Ball, I dunno.<br/><br/>Now a player who tries it and likes it can contact Jason and talk about how to go about making their own hack, or the thinking behind the game's set-up, but that's after they've already gotten their interest up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179178/#Comment_179178" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:35:59+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My anecdotal experience is that it's hard enough to get someone to play a game that's beyond the "2 game limit" that many gamers seem to have. But instead of just relying on that, let's horribly abuse some numbers and speculate wildly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's "common wisdom" that the online segment of people is "hardcore". People scoff at me because I don't self-identify as a "gamer", but I'm "hardcore" enough to be online talking about rpgs. Of course, I'm "casual" compared to most of the online folks, but that's a whole other thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we're going to make a few wild assumptions and then look at some numbers to see what these shake out to look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #1: D&amp;D; is the most popular rpg there is. Ok, that's not really wild, let's take it a step further. D&amp;D; is the _only_ rpg that matters when we talk about "rpgs" and "popularity". Don't worry I'm going somewhere with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #2: The people that are online talking about "rpgs" are all into D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #3: The forums that I pull some numbers from are going to be where all the D&amp;D; people show up. Yeah, that's a pretty wild one...<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #4: There is no cross-over between the forums. Meaning that every single user only hangs out in that forum, instead of signing up at multiple forums.<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #5: None of the ids on the forums are banned. In other words, if the mods ban someone from a forum, their name is purged from the member list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now for some numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGSite: 1,856 members<br/>\nRPG.net:  27,917 members<br/>\nENWorld: 78,678 members<br/>\nThe Forge: 6,558 members<br/>\nDragonsfoot: 4,309 members<br/>\nStory Games: 1,837 members<br/>\n<br/>\nThat gives us a grand total of 121,155. Yeah baby, a shade over 120 thousand hardcore D&amp;D; fans.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how many people are playing D&amp;D;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Wizards of the Coast claims that a survey done last year (2007) had an estimated 6 million people playing D&amp;D;, although Rouse says that number "may be somewhat inflated". You can find the article in question here:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23903817/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23903817/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUh oh.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust how inflated do we want to assume it is? *shrug* The more you assume the number is inflated, the better a chance we have here... so let's go for the gusto and say they lied their asses off. The actual number of people playing D&amp;D; is 1 million.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means that of the 1 million people playing D&amp;D;, only 120 thousand actually care enough about the game to come online and talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's freeze frame that for a sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nA free game is basically showing up one place: online. This means that your target audience is a bit over 120k people. Doesn't seem like too bad a shot, right? I mean, 120 thousand people...<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #6: All of the people that are online and willing to talk about rpgs are willing to play other games. I mean, they're hardcore rpgers, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWild Assumption #7: A free game is to indy rpgs, as indy rpgs are to D&amp;D.; Ok, this is so far off in la-la land that it's not even funny. All the folks itching to point out my fallacious assumptions, relax. I understand that what I'm doing is so far out there as to be worthless for some sort of "quantifiable" discussion. I'm still going along my chain of thought though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so we've got a pool of 120k people. They're all a potential market for the free game. What's it's chance of getting picked up and played?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Fred Hicks has been generous with making his sales numbers available. Here's what he has to say about Spirit of the Century:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/404797.html" rel="nofollow">http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/404797.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCombined lifetime sales of SotC: 3,128<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's my point with all this number shuffling and waving? It's fucking hard to get anyone to be willing to consider a free game. I've got no idea how Spirit of the Century compares to other small press/indy games in terms of sales, but I do know that just about every forum I listed (except maybe Dragonsfoot) has had some mention of Spirit of the Century.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a huge pool of people out there playing rpgs. That pool drops off significantly when you look at their willingness to invest in the game by finding other like-minded people and discussing it online. Of those people that _are_ willing to take the effort to come online and talk about rpgs? A tiny fraction of _those_ are going to be willing to step outside the dominant rpg.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whys and all that? *shrug* It's the usual laundry list of why people aren't willing to try out/buy small press/indy games in the first place. With the additional added problems of most free games having a name that the person doesn't recognize, nobody to tell them if the game is "good", and an overall lack of production values.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, gamers are consumer whores generally speaking. If it doesn't look pretty, they're not interested. Heck, it's hard enough to get 'em to even consider playing an rpg with cards instead of dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, let's not forget the almost pathological aversion that a decent chunk of the "hardcore" crowd (the one hanging out online) has to pdf format.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe numbers get even _more_ depressing when you consider that there's a chunk of the online people that don't even play. They buy the books like they're collecting art for #$%<a href="/forums/profile/%23%24">@#$</a> sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nGamers lie to themselves and buy up all kinds of stuff and say, "I'm going to run this game. Someday." Some of them are more honest and say, "I'm not actually going to run this, but I'm going to mine the hell out of it for ideas."<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I right? *shrug* I've got no idea. But the above is what runs through my head when I think about "free games" and the likelihood of them being played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179206/#Comment_179206" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T14:03:49+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  2:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 2:04PM by Jesse.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've been reading the 30+ Murderland games lately, and many of them are terrific, but I'm not sure there's a commercial market for games that short.

The position that competing with D&amp;D in productizing the game has not been tried does break down a bit in further review, but overall it stands relatively strong; this is what I wrote about myself, that being free correlates strongly with being less productized. Examples of free games that look like for-pay games... well, <a href="http://www.thalcos.com/rq.htm" rel="nofollow">Runeslayer</a> looks better than many commercial games, but it's not a free game phenomenon by any means, even when it combines some seriously advanced design with its full-color, graphical merits. Any other examples that'd gnaw at Raphael's position here?<br><br>And even if we had a free game with all the flashing lights of D&amp;D, as Raphael succintly puts it, it would be obvious that such a product wouldn't be marketed with the same massive intensity somebody who's job depends on it puts to pushing his own commercial product.<br><br>Then again, I suspect that D&amp;D is the wrong thing to compare free games with; I get a sense that Sean (the OP) was thinking of more modest levels of success. If free games performed even to the levels of the top-line indies, that'd be pretty well for something where nobody is getting paid to cross the t's and dot the i's.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179953/#Comment_179953" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T22:28:14+00:00" title="November 23, 2008 10:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite>Actually, let me revise that: I've never read a -RPG text- that I'd consider finished.

You can hit a few of the different torrent sites and find an awful lot of stuff out there. In fact, I'll go one further and point to a specific one: Demonoid.<br><br>Demonoid is one of those "private trackers". In order to join the site you have to either have an invitation code or manage to catch them during some "open signup" period or something.<br><br>Now, poking around there, it appears as though they've got a handy little thing to be able to sort through all the different stuff they offer. What we're looking at is "Books" for the category, with a subcategory of "RPG". Don't bother filling in anything else, just hit "apply filters" and watch all the other stuff disappear.<br><br>The first thing I noticed is that there seems to be one fellow responsible for an awful lot of uploads. Yeah, there's other people but he seems to cover small press/indy games to a (to me) surprising amount.<br><br>Premise 2: You're going to have to make your game look like it costs money.<br><br>For some of the various reasons people have given above.<br><br>The solution?<br><br>Maybe lift a page from viral marketing as well as what Andy did with Maid.<br><br>Interesting note: I work for a company that's involved in standardized testing in the U.S. If you're not familiar with it for some reason, standardized testing is that whole "No child left behind" thing the U.S. has, along with things like SAT, GRE, and other letters of the alphabet.<br><br>Anyway a while ago the company intranet had a general request that people go to youtube, rate the video that they'd posted there, and pass around links to friends and "other people that might find it of interest". "Help make our viral marketing a success!" was how they finished off the message.<br><br>William Gibson even did a book called "Pattern Recognition" that has a side character who's job is to dress up and look cool, and then go hang out in places and talk up different products.<br><br>Hangout in rpg.net and you'll find that if you've managed to make some fans of your game, there's a good chance that it'll get mentioned and recommended and probably even have a link posted to it.<br><br>So instead of making a game for pay and being disappointed, pissed off and all of that when it gets ripped off...<br><br>Why not just _make_ the game with the understanding and expectation that it's free, but go ahead and post a link so that people that are "honest" can go ahead and buy it if they want?<br><br>It sounds sorta crazy, but a lot of people seem to be shocked when they discover how television operates; they don't realize that _programs_ are what interrupts the commercials as far as everyone in the broadcast business is concerned.<br><br>The job of TV isn't to entertain you, it's to keep you at the TV long enough and often enough that you'll see the products being sold by the show's "sponsors".<br><br>Doing something like this is walking a bit of a fine line. The folks behind SenZar were roundly condemned and vilified in part because they tried to do this sort of thing and did it rather badly.<br><br>What needs to happen is for the game to make it to the torrent sites. It's gotta look like something that people would be expected to pay for and be worth that cost.<br><br>If it gets into the right hands (or just enough of them), then take a page from what Andy did. Instead of being pissed off he said, "Look, I'm willing to run a game for you people, no questions asked." At least, that's what I seem to recall from some rpg.net thread but I can't find it. Maybe I missed understood.<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the games need to actually be _made_ with the idea that they're going to be free and that those periods of free are "interrupted" by periods of people paying for them. In other words, change the fundamental perception of the game in the first place.<br><br>Instead of games fighting for gamer dollars, maybe they should be fighting for gamer _attention_ with the idea that the money is going to follow. Like television does.<br><br>Of course, with TV you've got a really low barrier to entry for the end-user as well as massive penetration of the demographic in terms of being able to get your message out there.<br><br>The micro-transaction and "shareware" ideas might be of use also. You get the core of everything free and then pay to get some additional cool bits. I guess "shareware" doesn't quite apply so much, because I don't think that you really want to be releasing some sort of cripple-ware rpg these days. There's too many games out there and available.<br><br>And again, if your stuff is available electronically, it's going to be pirated. So there's only so much you can expect to extract from that sort of micro-transaction/shareware type thing anyway.<br><br>I'll also note that something like this sort of thing only would work if there's a "known" quantity at some point in the process for there to be "validity" to the whole thing.<br><br>I'll mention that next.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180004/#Comment_180004" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T08:39:08+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  8:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick data point, in the early days of nerdnyc's gotham gaming guild and Recess, I saw quite a few people bring printed out games from bit torrent.

I probably wouldnt have bought indie games because i wasnt interested in traditional games anymore and wasnt sure about the differences. Anyway, i find this weird undercurrent of sites about indie rpgs but shipping them across the planet's very expensive and because i was rather burnt out on traditional rpgs i wasnt willing to spend money on some blind-faith aquisitions. I checked out some free games first and they got me interested enough to check out the larger community.Then  by using torrents i checked out some for-sale games, which i otherwise wouldnt ever have seen. I liked what i saw and decided to buy them at IPR. <br><br>So uhmm torrents got me into indie roleplaying , and no im not a collector , im actually playing these things (primetime right now) .                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180007/#Comment_180007" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T09:07:57+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:07AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so the whole "known quantity for validity" thing...<br><br>Premise: If you're an unknown, you're screwed for trying to do something unless you've _very_ lucky.<br><br>As I see it, if you're going to try and get an rpg out there, you're basically fucked unless you're already established or manage to get some other "established" person to essentially vouch for you by saying how good the game is.<br><br>That's kind of what reviewers are: they're not just telling you what the game is about, in some ways they're going to be a known quantity that the reader can use to help them decide if they want to get a game or not.<br/><br/>Now, some folks claim to never bother paying attention to reviews and all that static. Fine. I'd be _very_ surprised if they don't already have _some_ sort of vouchsafe system in place in lieu of relying on a reviewer. Unless they've just got enough disposable income and free time to be able to pick up games without consideration and read them. Who know about actual play.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>Reviewers are the most obvious vouchsafe system. I know I personally tend to decide on a reviewer's "credibility" based in part on how they've reviewed games (or whatever) that I do and do not like. This gives me a feel for where they're coming from and how much I can really rely on them. There's of course a lot of other stuff that goes into it, but I want to keep things simple.<br/><br/>Another issue is the name of the creator or writer. Of course, if you're brand new you don't have a name. Too bad. For those that are already established, you've already got at least a potential pool of people. Some might dislike you, but chances are you've at least got some fans. This one is pretty obvious too, just like reviewers.<br/><br/>After that is the general "buzz". This is the hardest thing. It relies on people within the online community already having built up a reputation, and that their reputation is enough that their word about how good (or bad) a game is will be enough to vouchsafe quality.<br/><br/>Around some place like rpg.net, the "obvious" initial thing is post-count. Like it or not, people with low post counts tend to be disregarded on message boards. High post count people are clearly more "hardcore" because they've posted so many bloody messages, so clearly they should know "quality" when they see it.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a tricky thing. If the person with a decent post count tends to only pop up in some sort of theory thread or a Palladium bashing one, then they're probably going to have less credibility than someone that's across a spectrum of threads. To a certain (and limited) extent, there's a built-in limiter for the amount of influence any one person is going to have. They've got to be fairly active and across a wide range of things, in order to really make it to a certain level of trust.<br/><br/>Then there's the already established designers that are (or are not) playing the game.<br/><br/>Let's take around here for example.<br/><br/>If someone hears about...oh, I don't know... 3:16. They poke around a bit to see if they can dig up some more info.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Looks like there was a free version done earlier. Oh great. I can get it for free or I can buy the 2nd edition of it. Whatever. Of course the pay version is going to talk about how improved it is, it's not like it's going to say "I'm ripping you off and this is just a shitty rehash of the 1st version but costing you money". Poke around some more... oh, hey look. They're talking about it over on Story Games. Maybe it isn't just another rpg.net darling/flavor of the week.<br/><br/>Say... those are all guys that are making and selling games. I like some of those games, and I've heard really good things about those others. They really seem to like it...<br/><br/>Of course, when it comes to something like an established name talking about how good some unknown game is, if the author of the game isn't recognized from previous work, it means that the established person is basically staking at least a portion of their reputation for "quality". If the established person doesn't have that many games available, or it's been a long time since they put anything out, then they don't have that much of a reputation to be "risking" in endorsement.<br/><br/>Because of course, what we're basically talking about is product endorsement.<br/><br/>It's either happening by a reviewer, other consumers, or some person of "note" (fame). Now, the "fame" or "person of note" aspect is pretty flexible/fluid as I've already said. It could be an established game designer, it could be someone that is calm and reasonable and that other game designers seem to respect, or whatever.<br/><br/>So, this is _the_ place for something like a free game to be able to succeed. Or at least be more likely to succeed. It's "indy" or "small press" or whatever label you want to stick on it. People here are beyond the crass commercialism that infects places like rpg.net, and they're also not locked into some single game like you'd expect over at ENWorld.<br/><br/>Oh yeah... where people are talking about the game is going to wind up being a bit of a vouchsafe check as well. I might check out ENWorld to see if anyone around there knows of Houses of the Blooded, because at least it'll let me know what the "average" gamer is likely going to think about it. RPG.net is going to let me know what a rather different sort of gamer thinks about it, and of course Story Games is appealing to yet another type.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180008/#Comment_180008" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T09:08:56+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:08AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the third part because I'm such a talky bastard. I'm going to have to get an editor for my posts someday...<br/><br/>What's the whole point?<br/><br/>It's a complicated mess for somebody to navigate this whole thing.<br/><br/>If someone is going to try going for the "guerrilla marketing" or "viral marketing" approach to getting their game out there and into people's hands, it's possible for it to succeed but they're going to have to work at it.<br/><br/>Before, it was easier in some ways. Publish it in a fan magazine, or make copies of it and pass it out at conventions. Because things in general were so... limited... in terms of the amount of things available, the ease with which they can be acquired, the expectation of production value, and so forth, doing this kind of thing in the past was a different sort of animal than now.<br/><br/>If I were going to try and do this, how would I do it?<br/><br/>I guess my approach would be to first make a game that looked like it cost money and that I expected people to pay for it. Meaning I'd see if I could work out some sort of a deal to get art that actually matched my game premise, and wasn't just a black and white line drawing from clipart.com. Nice cover, some pretty pictures inside, and something that doesn't look like it's from the 80's, unless I'm making some sort of a game explicitly evoking the 80's in the first place.<br/><br/>I'd also do my darnedest to see if I could get someone to do at least _something_ of an editing job on the text. I've got no idea what sort of a "writer" I am in comparison to other folks, but I know I'd like to have some sort of "professional" go over whatever it is I've got to say and turn it into a more cohesive text.<br/><br/>Layout... *sigh* By this point I've already spent a bunch of money out of pocket. I'd probably go ahead and take a look at how expensive it'd be to have someone do a nice layout job. I'm guessing it's going to be more than I've got to spend at this point, which means I'll have to try and do it myself. I personally happen to have access to InDesign and have even used it a bit for work purposes, so I'd try and do this myself. But if I had the money? I'd consider trying to tap someone to do this for me as well.<br/><br/>I'd also try and use people from the "community" for all of this. Meaning, folks I could find here or maybe at rpg.net. People around here have already had to go through the "growing pains" and might either be able to steer me in the proper direction, or could use a few extra bucks.<br/><br/>Then I'd try and set up some sort of page for buying it. Lulu seems like the way to go, but maybe I'd try some other place that wouldn't be too difficult (IPR?). I'd price the game low enough so that it's easy for people to get as an "impulse" buy, but not so low that it looks like I'm saying "this is a piece of crap you shouldn't pay too much for". I'd probably try and make it so that it seemed like it'd be worth paying at least $5 for the game.<br/><br/>After that... I'd try and get it into as many hands as I could. See if I could get people around here talking about it, or rpg.net or _something_. That usual round of promotions that people seem to struggle with.<br/><br/>I'd also try and figure out some way that it could be passed along to the pirates and torrent sites. Maybe include some sort of "disclaimer" message or something as part of the front page or intro or something. A request that if you illegally downloaded this game and enjoyed it, please buy it. Support the creator so that you can continue to enjoy these sorts of things.<br/><br/>I'd also try and make sure I could run some sessions online for the game. Something along the lines of, "I know that this game is available for free from torrent sites. I'm not going to say anything about that. No questions asked, I'm going to run a game online at [blah blah blah]. If you've bought the game and want to see how it plays and don't have a group available, come on by and I thank you for buying it. If you haven't bought the game, come on by anyway. Maybe you'll enjoy yourself enough that you'll pay for it afterwards."<br/><br/>That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Would it work? I don't know right now. I don't _think_ there's anyone out there "deliberately sabotaging" themselves. It's kind of an involved bit of misdirection: make a free game, but put the work into it like it's a "for pay" game, just to get your game out there and being played. Of course, it's not going to really work if you make it obvious that you're doing that in the first place.<br/><br/>It kind of becomes an elaborate game on the part of the creator. How to make a free game, but convince everyone that it's a pay game. And to do it without spending a huge amount of money.<br/><br/>Of course... it could be that it's what a lot of people are _doing_ right now, they're just not really aware of it and therefore not making as many good choices as they might otherwise. Much like television has the question of "Is it advertising that's interrupted by programs or the other way around?", it could be that the small press / indy side might really be a question of "Is this a game that's being pirated and stealing money from the authors, or is this a free game that's trying to get some donations on the sly?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180012/#Comment_180012" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T09:21:01+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybot</cite>I think the assumption that a substantial number of people would play a torrented game is rather naive.

I _am_ saying that there's a substantial number of people that are into file sharing and for a number of reasons, they're going to keep their mouths shut about it.<br/><br/>I'm also saying that it _should_ be possible to make the system work _for_ you instead of against you.

It might be beyond the scope/intent of this thread, but I thought I'd go ahead and offer a possible way that free games could actually be played _more_.<br/><br/>It's not the only way there is and there might be other ways that are better to achieve the goal. My approach is taken with the idea that I'm interested in getting people to try and hopefully enjoy something I'm responsible for. I have a "real job" and the only expectation and hope I have in terms of making money off the game is that it would pay for itself. As in "the money I actually spent to make this happen".<br/><br/>My goal in doing something like this would probably not the same as many other folks kicking around. If I'm going to the effort to make a game, I want folks playing the stupid thing. That's the primary thing for me.

As you'll see, whole my post is just a <b>double underline</b> under that sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, speaking as a person "from outside" (outside heavy, hardcore, independent designer crowd) I'm amazed how easily many designers get settled and satisfied with short concept-games, with no art, no solid base in design, targeted only at a group of hardcore fans. I think I know why many RPG players in Poland are so sceptical when it comes to INDIE games, and I think that this idea is international:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey see INDIE games as game concepts. Unfinished experiments, that lack enthusiasm, flavor and support.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow again, people who like creating games, ones that started their interest in RPG by being game masters in D&amp;D; or somethin', and over last few years suddenly changed their titles to better sounding "Game Designers" - they will play games made by themselves <b>anyway</b>. Their friends, (other game designers) will put their opinion on this game anyway (because they are "Game Designers", right?), even if they won't play it. Each one of you, gentlemen, who ever actually <b>wrote</b> and "sold" a game, has his lil' (or not so little) crowd of fans, that I bet that in most cases just grew over your orginal gaming group. And those people will play your game too. End of story.<br/>\nWhat with the rest, the 99% of network-active roleplayers? What with the <b>kids</b>? (God knows I love this word)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are speaking of popularity, and that's a major part of the <b><span style="color:#3300FF">Sean's</span></b> question, we should be speaking of a game aimed to be popular. And we can't say that about all, or most of independent games. What's the best shot? Dogs in the Vineyard? Great game, cool idea. If it would be a movie, it would have lotsa fans. But it would never be a blockbuster. Too little "zing". "No lights included".<br/>\n<br/>\nI remeber the time, when on one of the polish fan forums (and we have lots of those, more than any other country, cause Poles <b>love</b> to play games) I pissed off Arioch, a guy you know as <b><span style="color:#3300FF">Bunnybot</span></b>, a renowned INDIE promoter in polish fandom. We were talking about game designing, and I said that INDIE games are too small, too niche to ever get really popular. "No one will ever <b>love</b> them" I said. God, he can't stand me, that guy... Anyway, while "no one" is of course too big words, I think that it's near true, looking at all the network-active (I need to find a word for that) players out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nInnovative games, or easy games. Smart games, or involving games. Brilliantly desinged games, or pretty games. Games that are like breath of fresh air, or games with the "zing".<br/>\nReally good games, or popular games. It's simple as that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the mainstream shows us, how to make a popular game. Not that hard. "Easy" many "game designers" would say. "Too easy for me" some would say. And off they go, creating innovative RPG poems, interactive songs with rosary-based mechanics, and other kinds of funny-bunny games, no offence.<br/>\nIt's all good, if they are doing it for themselves, and other desiners, and a bunch of fans. But I just can't believe that so many of them have no ambition to create something more massive. Something <b>popular</b>.<br/>\nAnd taking the best things invented in INDIE expriments, and implementing it into one, pumped, colorfull game, and then distributing it <b>free </b>by any means possible (and "any means possible" is not a commercial on INDIE games site) - I say it could be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it just that no one is as ambitious?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, lets hear it again:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">My goal in doing something like this would probably not the same as many other folks kicking around. If I'm going to the effort to make a game, I want folks playing the stupid thing. That's the primary thing for me.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThats what <b>I</b> want. I don't care about 5$ per book. I don't care if I redefined meta-mechanics and the very core of RPG genre. All I care, is to make my game <b>fun </b>to play for <b>most </b>people. I want them to <b>play </b>the stupid thing. As many people as I get with all means. And if this 5$ would be the final frontier for some possible players? Screw the 5$! And God, would I be proud, if I could find my game torrented/on Emule...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: Why, as a writer, do I feel alone in approaching that goal? Are game designers not interested in popularity? And I mean: popularity beyond their fellow designers crowd?<br/>\n<br/>\nLets ponder over it, listening to Bach.<br/>\nGod, I talk too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180064/#Comment_180064" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T12:54:39+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 12:54PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 1:04PM by Deckard.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">We were talking about game designing, and I said that INDIE games are too small, too niche to ever get really popular.

I dunno, let's say "practical"... aspects of why I think free games aren't getting the same kind of play as other games. There's also a more... "practical"... one I think. It might be a bit of a "No duh dude" kind of thing for the folks around here, but I think the issue of design is another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's sort of along the lines of what Raphael is talking about, designing it so it's "popular". I say sort of because I think he's leaning in a different direction (or looking at something a bit different) than I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing strictly on the idea of "this is a free game" and "why do free games seem to not be played as often" I think game design is a factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Forge has stuff about fantasy heartbreakers, which seems to have spread beyond The Forge and been adopted by many people as a polite way of saying, "shitty game". I'm not passing judgements, I'm just saying that's the way the term gets used most often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a lot of free games have been made by folks that were basically going down the "hearbreaker" path as the term seems to have been originally coined.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's "my first game design" done by folks that have limited experience with systems, and/or game design theory as it's been developed by The Forge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften this means the games will tend to either be so focused as to be of no interest to any but an extremely narrow segment of people, or it's Yet Another Free Game which basically boils down to "hearbreaker" type design.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt never seemed especially hard to find this or that random free game available as well, and after a while they all kind of tend to blur together. Sure, there might be something nifty and cool (The Pool or The Window?) but unless cruising the internet and checking out rpgs is your hobby, chances are that you're going to hit a point where you see "free game" and shoot right on past it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a quick question... I just popped on over to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.1km1kt.net/</a> which claims to be "the largest collection of free rpg games online!". Looking at the sidebar on the right, it shows that under Free RPGs it's got 459 listed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of those 459, how many of the games around here have people played? How many of those 459 have been submitted by people around here? And how many folks are playing one of those free games _right now_?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, 3:16 doesn't count unless you're playing the free version that was posted there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI _know_ why I'm not playing free games. I'm betting that a fair number of people here aren't playing them either. I'm sure everyone can come up with a list of reasons why they're not playing those games, but at the end of the day it boils down to "I'm not playing free games, but I am playing others".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some cases, it's possible that folks are taking the same route as Jonathan and playing free games and games that are both for sale as well as being made available for free. I'm going to be _extremely_ surprised if he's typical though. Especially if people out there are playing free games _generally_, as opposed to "pets". Red Box Hack for example. It looks cool (I'd like to try and run it myself) and it's free, but it's kind of coming to an audience that's already pre-disposed to giving it a try. And part of the reason why the audience here is pre-disposed to giving it a try is because Eric posts here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe's already "established" himself with enough people that think he's got a good head on his shoulders to give it a shot. And for those that don't know him, there's probably a few people that they do feel they know that have tried RBH and are willing to give it a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, there's the reputation of Story Games itself. As a general rule, you don't expect to find something like World of Synnibarr around here. Sidenote: I like an awful lot of stuff about Synnibarr, just not the system. There's a level of glee to the game that seems to be missing from a lot of games these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not criticizing anyone. I'm saying that I would personally think that if there was going to be a... "haven"?... for folks that dig free games and actively play them, it'd be some place like here; the "indy" or small press scene. If the majority(?) around here aren't even into playing free games as a general rule, ummm... well, I think that's just kind of sums it up. "Free games get played less" - Why do you believe this?... because the majority of people just aren't playing them. If the small press / indy side can't be generally bothered with playing them, and we know that the majority of people outside of this place are into playing D&amp;D; or White Wolf, it means that folks playing free games are generally an anonymous blip on the radar. It might be possible to change that, but that's a whole other proposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raphael%20Sadowski" title="Raphael Sadowski"><img alt="Raphael Sadowski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.polter.pl/sub/g32071.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raphael%20Sadowski">Raphael Sadowski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180245/#Comment_180245" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:25:22+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:25AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 9:25AM by Raphael Sadowski.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"Free games get played less" - Why do you believe this?... because the majority of people just aren't playing them.

I don't _think_ I'm saying what you seem to think I'm saying... so there's a miscommunication happening somewhere I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think that "we" should seek out good free games and support them. I'm not going there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to stay within the original premise of the thread, which was  "Free games get played less" - Why do you believe this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've offered my thoughts about why that is and then engaged in some wild speculation as to why my thoughts/perceptions about why that is might have some basis in reality. Admittedly, I did have a bit of a detour there with some speculating about how it might be possible to increase the hands that a free game gets into.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there might be a couple of different conversations sort of happening here. Raphael, you make some points that might bear some fruit if they were explored in a slightly different fashion or a different thread, but I'm not entirely sure you're going to get the kind of conversation you seem to be looking for in this particular thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesigning a free game, why you design it, who the target audience is, all of these are good questions I think. I also think that they're questions that have _not_ been asked by many people (most?) that have done a free game in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a game doesn't work for you or whatever, that's groovy. Different things work for different people. I'm not quite sure the point you're making; or the counter-point you're making to what I've said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the by, feel free to call me "Chris" or "Christopher".

It doesn't matter whether it's a "pay" game or a "free" game. _WHY_ a game isn't being played can be an interesting question. Sean apparently does _not_ believe that free games get played _less_ than games that have been bought.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there might be more "pay" games available than "free" ones, there's certainly enough free ones out there. The ones I hear about? Less than a dozen I think. Let's see, off the top of my head this is what springs to mind when I think "free rpg". I'll note that they spring to mind because I want to play/run them, find them interesting in some fashion, or just because they're what you hear about when you hear "free rpg".<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Shadows of Yesterday</b>.

It's evolved over time and different iterations power Truth &amp; Justice, Zorcerer of Zo, and the upcoming Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies. I've got a lot of love for PDQ and it's my "go to" game.<br/>\n<b>d20 SRD</b>. There's an awful lot possible to do with this unwieldy behemoth.<br/>\n<b>Anima Prime</b>. I'm curious about this, but mainly know about it because of poking around here.<br/>\n<b>OSRIC</b> and <b>Labyrinth Lord</b>. Clones of old D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<b>4C</b>. Clone of the Marvel Faserip as I recall.<br/>\n<b>Risus</b>. S. John Ross game that seems to be treated as something only worth 1-shots but not really capable of more.<br/>\n<b>The Pool</b><br/>\n<b>The Window</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThat about covers my brainspace for free games, at least off the top of my head. Oh wait, I know... John Kim has a list of free games... let's see:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/freerpgs/fulllist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/freerpgs/fulllist.html</a><br/>\nDang, he claims to list over 500 free rpgs. I've got no idea what the cross over is between his list and the 1km1kt site. But I do notice that 3:16 isn't listed there, so there probably isn't too much overlap if any.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also notice that while TSOY is listed, he doesn't have Anima Prime nor Donjon. So there's still free games that are slipping through the cracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, out of that list that I just put up, how many of these games get chatter online? Well, TSOY gets some around Story Games, SotC gets chatter around rpg.net, and Red Box gets a bit of chatter around here. You can find a tiny bit of talk about the old D&amp;D; clones, but that's about it. Every so often over at rpg.net someone mentions Risus as a good rules light game, but there's no real _talk_ about it that I've seen. The d20 SRD stuff doesn't actually get chatter because people aren't using the SRD except as a stand in for their D&amp;D; book. Most of the people that are going to do some sort of game using the d20 SRD have already done it, and are up to their 2nd edition of the game, or simply moved on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkimming through John Kim's list, I certainly spot names I recognize. But not stuff I've actually done anything with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic" title="toilet psychic"><img alt="toilet psychic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic">toilet psychic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180286/#Comment_180286" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T12:32:25+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 12:32PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 12:33PM by toilet psychic.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games I've played:<br/>\n<br/>\nRisus - lot of times, one Conan minicampaign, my friends are still using it<br/>\nFrenzy - once again, many times.

My experience in the past 20 years? "Gamers" usually have a "2 game" maximum, although some stretch to 3. Meaning that they're only going to invest themselves in 2 or 3 games maximum. They might _buy_ more than that, but often it's because they plan on cannibalizing their purchases for one of the 2 (or 3) games that they're "committed" to.<br/>\n<br/>\nA free game comes out... and that's it. There usually aren't supplements or anything else. No "support" offered. Maybe Story Games people are different, but most of the gamers I've seen online (which is the target market of free games remember)? They're consumers. Hardcore. Poke over to rpg.net and the main forum is littered with people basically begging to be given a reason to buy some game that's coming out or just come out.<br/>\n<br/>\nFree games don't do anything to feed that consumer drive. It's like popcorn or something for them. They don't feel it's a "real" meal or something, unless they've ponied up $50 and are looking at getting at least a few supplements. If not, it's quickly written off as a "dead" game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/buddha%20the%20postman">buddha the postman</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">You must to look for active agents/fans and community that support the game.

It also started out as a pay game and then later the rule were made available. I'll also note that the only place I see Wushu talked about is rpg.net and that's by a rather small and vocal handful of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI note that out of at least 500 games (John Kim's list and not including 1km1kt) you've listed 5 games. I know Risus has a community, I'm a member of the yahoo group. It manages roughly 1 message a month. The other games? No "community" that I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sort of thing you're talking about "will to promote until it reaches critical mass"... how often do you see that with a _free_ game? You might not _need_ it to have a "pretty look, great layout and other stuff commonly asossiated to commercial games", but I'd say that the fact that there's more than 500 games out there that don't have all of that and aren't played except by a tiny handful of people seems to indicate that a lot of people do _want_ that from their games.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/buddha%20the%20postman">buddha the postman</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">There are many commercial games that are not played and weren't sold in tremendous quantities.

The rpg business as a whole tends to be extremely tight-lipped about sales numbers. Some of the small press people (Evil Hat for example) do say what their sales numbers are. About the only "big name" company that I know of that talks about this stuff publically is Steve Jackson Games. They do a "Report to Stakeholders" talking about how things have gone for them. check out this year's. You'll find that Munchkin is what's been keeping them going. Support for Gurps is 4th priority and that's in the electronic format. 6th priority for them was to put out 2 hardback books. For the year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180391/#Comment_180391" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T21:58:44+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh for pete's sake... this is ridiculous. I'm going to have to get me an editor for these stupid posts of mine... anyway, part 2 of the above post...\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty sure that there's an awful lot more people out there playing Gurps than free games. I'd also say that Gurps is a lot more prominent and visible than free games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you want to say that's because of advertising? I'll agree with you. There's ads for Gurps, there's people talking about Gurps, and Gurps is sold in game stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, game stores. See, Gurps is eating from a couple of different pies. Not only does it get to eat from the hardcore gamer pie (all those people that go online) but it gets to eat from the "real world" pie too. All those other gamers that don't care enough to go online and talk about rpgs, that go into game stores and buy (or at least browse) there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, there's a lot of commercial games that don't get played much. There's just as many (if not more) free games that are in the same boat. But this goes back to what's been said earlier... if you've shelled out $50 for a game and just downloaded a free one, which one are you most likely going to run first? Chances are it's the one that you had to pay for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for a free game to be able to compete with a pay product, it's got to _really_ work hard at it. The free game has to compete with at least _some_ sort of advertising, production values, access to a wider audience. the ability for a consumer to "buy into" a community... there's an awful lot of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarians of Lemuria... I've heard it mentioned a couple of times in passing. Recently on rpg.net it was brought up again. In part because the author is doing a new "For pay" version. Is there an active community around the free version? None that I know of. Are there fans of it? Well, I know Andy liked the free version and a few other people on rpg.net mentioned liking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author is asking $10 for the pdf and I've no idea what the book cost from Lulu will be. This is a _pay_ product (expanded from a free product) and there's virtually no advertising or anything for it that I'm aware of. Will it be a success? I don't know. It depends entirely on what the author wants in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that many for pay products have one primary goal: sell the product. Many of the authors _also_ hope that the game is being played and enjoyed, but that's a secondary goal I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in that regard, I think pay products are "more successful". The exact numbers of people _playing_ the game are unknowable. Probably more than those playing any given free game, simply because there's a greater potential pool of people to draw from. But the books are _sold_ which is one of the primary goals of the game. Another goal is to be able to sell more products, either in the same line or a new line.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the goal of a free game is for people to play it... I think most of them are at least somewhat unsuccessful, if not outright failures. There's virtually no discussion that I see about free games (with a few rare exceptions and even those don't very much talk), and at least a couple of free games have moved away from being free games and become pay products. I don't have a problem with authors wanting to make some money or get a return on their investment. So I personally don't have a problem with things like 3:16 and Barbarians of Lemuria being done as pay products.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the thing is, part of the way that gamers are being encouraged to buy them is talking about how they've "improved". Sure, the free version is playable, but if you buy it you get a much _better_ game. Which just helps to subtly reinforce the idea that even if a free game is "pretty good" something you pay for is going to be "better".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8130/free-games-get-played-less-why-do-you-believe-this" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8130/free-games-get-played-less-why-do-you-believe-this" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8130/free-games-get-played-less-why-do-you-believe-this/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8130%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8130%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
