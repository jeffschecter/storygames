                    So in one of Matt's threads, he talks about the perception people have of gamers, and bringing new people into gaming, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to tell a story about getting "outed" as a gamer last Spring, which was really humiliating.  But first I want to say my purpose of the thread is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1.  For people to discuss being "out" as gamers, being outed, etc. <b>based on personal experience.</b>  (I'm sure everyone has an opinion on this, or can invent one with a few moments' notice, but I don't want empirical signal to be lost in theoretical noise.)<br/>
<br/>
2.  To discuss attemps to bring new people into gaming, which actually worked <b>based on personal experience</b> (ditto.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my underlying theory here is that I don't care who games, with whom, what games they play or how.  Basically, the reason I want to bring new people into gaming is that I enjoy it, and I wish I could play more often, and had more people to play with.  Whether this dilutes the Elite Awesome Cult of Gaming Hobbyists, or whether it has economic impacts for designers, or is good for POD publishing: for me, personally, as a gamer, I just want to play a good game once every other week, you know?  And I don't want to get weird stares about doing it.<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
Okay, so this is me getting outed.  Late April 2006.<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to turn 30.  I've been out of college several years, finishing up my first year of law school.  Most of my classmates are a couple years younger than me, and, by and large, most of them are pretty cool people once you get to know them.  (There are a few raging pricks, but nowhere near as many as I'd feared, considering that it's law school.)<br/>
<br/>
So, my whole life, I've been the nerd with Charisma 13: just enough to be get along with everyone, but still unmistakably a member of the nerd race (+2 to saves vs. STD's, -2 to spot checks without corrective lenses).  Coming to law school, I'm like, "All these people are over-achieving dorks.  I'll be among my own kind."<br/>
<br/>
But no, it turns out that even among nerds, there are nerds, and I'm one of 'em.  I like talking to people if we've got something in common, but I'm no good at parties, and prefer to get to know strangers over time.  (It turns out people notice this about you!)  Also, apparently I know more stuff than the average bear.  (It turns out people notice this too.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so I'm chatting with people during a smoking break.  We've got Goldberg, the class president, who's openly gay; Fernandez, the Scalia-worshipping goofball; and Shlimmy, on whom I've got kind of a casual crush in the already-in-a-wonderful-relationship sort of way.  These are all people I get along with, and are probably my best acquaintance-friends in law school.<br/>
<br/>
GOLDBERG: James, did you ever play Dungeons &amp; Dragons?<br/>
<br/>
ME: (Fuck.  Fuck fuck fuck.)  Um--<br/>
<br/>
GOLDBERG:   --'cuz it seems like you would have been the type.<br/>
<br/>
ME: Yeah, as a kid.  It was fun.  (don't mention that I've spent most of the last six classes of Civ Pro flipping around in the on-line SRD--the mounted combat feat tree is <i>awesome</i>)<br/>
<br/>
SHLIMMY: (smokes; gazes at us; gazes into the distance)<br/>
<br/>
GOLDBERG: I remember hearing about that from other kids, you know?  That it had, like, twenty-sided dice.<br/>
<br/>
FERNANDEZ: All kinds, man.  Four-sided, eight-sided.  (to me) I think the box had a twelve-sided one too, right?     With the little crayon?<br/>
<br/>
ME: Yeah... But it was kind of stupid.  (Don't mention that in 8 hours I'm going to be playing Sorcerer with Jon and Eric, and I'm super excited about it)<br/>
<br/>
FERNANDEZ: Oh, I don't know, it was kind of fun.<br/>
<br/>
GOLDBERG: Twenty sided dice.... (shaking his head)<br/>
<br/>
SHLIMMY: (snubs out cigarette)                </div>

                            Oh, and a quick thing about the word "outed" -- there have been a couple threads about this on the Forge, and on RPGNet, from time to time.  And usually, either a gay gamer, or a gamer worried about gays, will suggest that the word "outed" doesn't belong to gamers to use for this phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
I'm totally fine with making that distinction, but, having made it, I intend to use the word anyway, at least in this thread; no harm's intended.                        </div>

<p>I've stopped being afraid of talking about gaming.  I've just learned to talk about it in a non-dorky way.  <em>"Do I play D&amp;D?  Heck yeah, I play D&amp;D.  It's fun.  You should try it."</em>  Suddenly my hobby is the center of attention because everyone wants to know what's so darned cool about it.  Occationally someone expresses an interest in trying it out.  When they do we eventually work out a game night.  None have been deeply hooked as yet, but every one laughs and has a good time.  Once they get over thinking that they aren't good enough to make up stories off the top of their head the way the rest of the group does.</p>

                            This isn't much of a 'story' in the same way, but it is a conversation that happened yesterday, so I figure I'd toss it out there. I'm no Truman Capote, so I will avoid attempting to reproduce an actual conversational script.<br><br>In any case, I was meeting with some spoken word poets &amp; fellow organizers of a program where we send performance poets into high schools to run writing workshops for the kids. Thus, these people are equal parts hipster and social weirdo artists. And they all know that I roleplay, in any case, though little else about it. Anyways, I had some Go Play stickers in my notebook that they noticed, and they were like 'hey, cool play stickers' (referring to the universal meaning of the triangle on remote controls.<br><br>I admit I hesitated a little before 'admitting' -- and yes, it felt like an admission -- that they were actually a roleplaying gamer 'thing'. I obviously failed to present the idea in its true spirit, since they immediately caught on to it being some sort of insider thing -- like we distributed them among ourselves so we could recognize each other and give knowing winks, etc. Which of course it is, from a position outside the hobby.<br><br>Anyways, one of them immediately launched into a story about watching some LARPers beat each other up with foam weapons in a park in Montreal (or Boston, or I don't remember), with a general tone of amusement and friendly ridicule. I casually defended this activity, pointing out that I used to do the same thing, and that it's pretty fun. The third person, who has a Czech background, brought up historical reenactors in the Czech republic, and how there were castles everywhere, and how she thought the Czech nerds -- i.e. LARPers who wanted to hit each other with foam weapons -- had an easier time of it, since there was already this subculture in place and it was more widely accepted. It's difficult to pin down the general tone of the conversation -- it varied from LARPers-are-hilarious-and-weird to I-have-sympathy-for-people-who-engage-in-'loser'-activities to oh-wait-I-didn't-mean-to-call-anyone-a-loser, exactly -- but after the initial stumble of 'admitting' the origin of the stickers and feeling awkward, it was a fairly comfortable conversation. <br><br>I do think it's interesting that LARPers were very clearly the vision of 'roleplaying gamers' for one of them, who also relayed a story about how a friend of hers organized a zombie flashmob to 'attack' the Montreal LARPers (who meet on Mont Royal regularly, thus making them both visible and predictable targets!)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Levi Kornelsen wrote (I think on rpg.net somewhere) once about how most of the stigma was, in effect, self-inflicted. This is plainly visible to me in James' story. So when I changed jobs in February 2006, I decided I was going to be totally open about the fact that I game. Now, granted, I'm a software engineer, and although none of my immediate co-workers were gamers (see below), they're all computer nerds, and several played World of Warcraft or similar fantasy computer games. So I admit it wasn't as threatening an environment as, say, law school. <br><br>Point is, when people would ask me what I was going to do over the weekend, I'd flat out tell them I was running an RPG, and then we'd talk about what that was and their experiences with people who they knew who shared the hobby. This led to curiosity, and two of them recently joined our game nights. Intercube talk is now RPG-geekery in addition to all the other geekery it was before. A couple of other people around us are weird about trying it with my other players they don't know, but we stopped by a game store at lunch, looked at a bunch of RPGs, and they settled on Spycraft 2.0, which will have its first game in a conference room at the office (after working hours) sometime after the new year (I'll GM, with at least 4 players who are either totally new to the hobby since they met me, or haven't played in 15 years).<br><br>Maybe this is the exception. There will always be the creepy guy who wants to tell somebody who doesnt care all about his character. I was a missionary in LA for two years - I think I can tell when somebody doesn't care about what I'm trying to say. So be honest about the fun you're having, inclusive and nonthreatening, and treat it just like you were talking about fantasy football or golf; treat it as though its a totally normal hobby to bring up. If you're awkward about it, or creepy, that's self-inflicted social stigma as far as I'm concerned. If they're awkward or weird about it, maybe they'll change their minds when they see somebody 'normal' who's not afraid to talk about the hobby. <br><br>The idea that its only for weirdos can only persist if only weirdos admit to the hobby.  Thats my thoughts, and my story.<br><br>Dave<br><br><b> edit</b>: Crossposted with Eric - thats exactly what happened with me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In theory I'm not afraid to talk about gaming; I mention it in passing to friends of longer standing.  But I <i>really</i> want to have that conversation when I'm ready for it, and preferably on my terms.<br/>

On the positive side, bringing new people in!  My girlfriend is casually interested in Nobilis, SOY, and Breaking the Ice.  We've made characters for BTI twice now, but we're so busy with other stuff we haven't gotten around to playing yet.  Hopefully we'll fix that over the semester break.                        </div>

                            So, like, I used to have trouble outing myself about anything. I was afraid to be a gamer, a nerd, a feminist, a queer, a good citizen.<br><br>Honestly, I would cover up my tracks when volunteering, because at school I'd hear people say "man, 30 hours of community service, this blows. Stupid graduation requirements." And I'd be like, "Hm. I better not mention that I am planning to spend roughly 30 hours THIS WEEK ALONE doing volunteer activities. Keep that hush, hush."<br><br>Because, you know, when I mentioned shit I was involved in I was called a goody-goody two-shoes, or an overachiever, or I was told that I was "doing bitch work for free". ...Similarly, I was afraid to admit that I was queer, because I'd get the shit kicked out of me. I was afraid to be a gamer, lest I be ridiculed. To summarize: high school is a ridiculously vicious place.<br><br>The thing is, I hated being afraid to own my identity. It was stupid. The kind of people who were going to judge me are the kind of people I'd prefer to single out and avoid anyways.<br><br>So, here's how I approached that conversation before:<br><br>Him: So, are you like a D&amp;D player?<br>Me: Um... urr.. no. I mean, I was once. Boy, that was dumb.<br>Him: Yeah. d&amp;d is for snivelling losers who don't get laid.<br>Me: *snivels, like a loser who doesn't get laid, all the while dying on the inside a bit*<br><br>And now, the approach I take:<br><br>Him: So, are you like a D&amp;D player?<br>Me: Yeah. I'm huge into games. I played D&amp;D for a long time.<br>Him: Oh yeah. ... Cool. (note that this "cool" is lukewarm)<br>Me: *nods* I play a lot of different games now though - both roleplaying and like, card games and such.<br>Him: Cool. (note that this "cool" is cool)<br><br>So, here are the things I do when someone talks to me about games:<br><br>1.) Build on what they say. Note in the example above, even though I no longer play d&amp;d, I used to, so saying yes is a building block. It bridges what they are (at least, marginally) familiar with, with what I want to talk about. "Yes, and..." tactics.<br/>"Do you X?"<br/>"Yes, and a lot of Y and Z too. More Y and Z than X, but all the letters in the alphabet are cool."<br/><br/>2.) Go with their lead. Sometimes someone asks me about d&amp;d and RPGs, and then uses that as a diving board to RISK. Even though the two conversations are entirely different and they just went into a gigantic tangent, my immediate response is, "oh, man, RISK! I used to play that game all the time with my friends." And if they started talking about tactics, I'd talk about tactics. If they talked about conquering nations, I'd bridge back into the discussion of RPGs, with this AP-kind of narration of a game I'd played that focused on conquering nations and war.<br/>"Yeah, but the games I play are nothing like d&amp;d" or "yeah, but that's not the same at all" are both conversation killers are dividers. Thus, I avoid if possible.<br/><br/>3.) Remember that too many details can kill inquiry. Answer in a way that feels honest, like you want to talk about whatever is being inquired about, but don't go into great length unless you know people are genuinely interested in that. If someone says, "...like d&amp;d?", my general reply is "yeah, in the sense that we are doing collective storytelling and roleplaying. I mean, the focus and the social dynamics are different, but if you understand how d&amp;d works then it wouldn't be foreign to you." The answer doesn't feel 100% to me, but the 100% answer would kill their inquiry dead. They'd be like, "mhmm. Okay. Right. Let's talk about something else, because you shut down my attempt to connect with your experience."<br/><br/>So, yeah. That's what works for me, both in sharing my hobbies and cultivating interest and inquiry. This isn't an RPG-specific thing, it's part of how I communicate with people about my interests in general.<br/><br/>EDIT: Crossposted with everyone except the OP.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Much like others, I've actually had positive-to-neutral experiences talking to people I know professionally/socially about my RPG hobby. Like any hobby, there's a certain amount of "yeah, whatever" or smack-talk, but really, no more so than for other things I've been into at one time or another. I can't think of any time since middle-school when I've really gotten the "That is so uncool" thing from people who weren't already basically looking for a way to be cooler-than-thou. I've actually found it to be a fun icebreaker in certain social circles - make a casual D&amp;D reference among techies or some artsy types, and often its off to the races with tales of stoned weekends. The key is, don't be embarassed about it yourself.<br/><br/>I've really only had negative experiences admitting my <i>tastes</i> in RPGs to other geeks.                        </div>

                            This is a funny thread, because just this evening I was having dinner with a venture capital/entrepreneur/started-five-companies guy.  And during sushi he mentions something about being involved in LARPs back in the day.  And I'm like "what?  I was a red-box D&amp;D player, fer gods sake!"  And instantly, we had this strangely geek bond.<br/><br/>But the flip side of this is that I've been talking to any and all people at work and in "normal" social banter about RPGs lately, but I don't call them that.  I just call them "games" or maybe "story games".  I get them interested in the subject matter without using the "R" word or the "D" word.  Amazingly enough, after the holidays I am running a game of Cat for 4 women who have never touched an RPG, but think "a game about cats" has to be the best thing in the world.  And I'm hoping to rope my Mom into The Princes' Kingdom over the holidays when I run it for my niece and nephew.  How cool is that?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I do think it's interesting that LARPers were very clearly the vision of 'roleplaying gamers' for one of them, who also relayed a story about how a friend of hers organized a zombie flashmob to 'attack' the Montreal LARPers (who meet on Mont Royal regularly, thus making them both visible and predictable targets!)</blockquote>
Same here; I suspects it's partly because LARPing is a visible, concrete activity - it's easier to understand, whereas tabletop playing lacks the physical activity and tends to lack the clear physical components of board, cards and whatever. Both forms are based on imagination, but LARPs have that physical aspect that makes them more understandable, although that comes with a price of "Oh, yeah, you hit each other with those foam swords. Do you do kendo as well?"<br/><br/>Both activities are slowly gaining the Normal, if Somewhat Geeky -status. We've had a steady flow of roleplaying articles (mostly LARP) in magazines in the last few years; getting a review of an RPG and RPG magazine in the largest newspaper, getting several articles of conventions and events (we had a running series of a journalist preparing and attending the Dragonbane-larp in the culture section) in the same magazine which is read by approximately every one citicen in five. Getting television coverage isn't bad, either. In Denmark, on the other hand, LARP's sit there, as youth activity, with football and scouting. I think it's partially connected to roleplayers coming out of the self-made closet, which is slowly happening everywhere, as the so-called geeks are starting to inherit the culture and the earth.<br/><br/>Personally, I too have some reservations when discussion turns into my gaming; I have little problem in telling what I do, but a lot more problems in telling why and how I do it. It gets especially painful and turned around when people are actually intrested: "You know, that sounds cool and I'd like to try it out sometime", and I'm thinking like "Yeah, but not with me, because you just wouldn't get it".                        </div>

I've dealt with this a little in the past. And the answers I get have a little of many of the above. I have had people who wanted to try out a new sport for the first time with people they knew (so as to avoid looking dumb, making an ass of themselves in front of strangers, and to be able to learn in a safe environment), so the bowling thing does happen sometimes. All the other points I get from time to time as well. I've also occasionally had people talk about "safety" in a sense like they were worried about the old media reports that playing D&amp;D can make you kill your mother with a sword, and felt that was less likely to happen if they played with the sane people. <br/><br/>But the thing I got most often, especially to folks I'd sold more on the "story" aspect than the "game" aspect, was that there was for whatever reason an sense of implied intimacy about the activity. (This could be something about telling stories, or about group dynamic, or maybe the way I pitched it as I have a noted tendency to hate gaming with strangers.) For whatever reasons of background I'd often get people saying that they wanted to try it first only with people they knew, because it'd be weird to do it with strangers and doing something creative was something best done with a small group of folks you knew. <br/><br/>The folks I picked up in advanced level writing workshops were often the exception to that. But then they're all attention whores anyway.                        </div>

                            Iâ€™ve had a heck of a lot of this over the past year, as Iâ€™ve basically kickstarted my gaming out of the (over a decade long) wilderness, and so have had to take an active part in forming my playgroups. Whenever I broach the subject, I try to approach it from the â€˜wide spectrum of gamesâ€™ angle, where roleplaying is just an activity among many. That way, people can pick on the thing theyâ€™re comfortable with, and you havenâ€™t locked them into an awkward conversation. Itâ€™s worked pretty well.<br/><br/>My â€˜worstâ€™ experience so far has been when Iâ€™ve needed to introduce gaming into a conversation with a near-stranger. My friend John was having a celebration and I bumped into a guy he works with, Bjorn, who I had met the week before at Johnâ€™s Mountain Witch game. I was introduced to a second workmate, who asked how Bjorn and I knew one another. <br/><br/>There was an uncomfortable beat where I wondered: am I about to out Bjorn (who I barely know)? Weâ€™re out at a London club on a Friday night, arenâ€™t I supposed to be drinking caipivodkas and acting cool? What on earth is she likely to think of this? (The fact that she was a she is of no little importance.) I took a breath and launched into it, and of course, we werenâ€™t sneered at. She seemed to have difficulty understanding the activity, but probably no more so than back when I tried to explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosh" rel="nofollow">slam-dancing</a> to a group of sporty students*. It was a foreign concept, but not a wretched one.<br/><br/>Every other experience has been positive â€“ my clinical trainee workmate and my chic Italian friend  - both non-geeky women in their mid-late 20s â€“ were both actively excited and said in principle they would be up for playing or at least sitting in. Iâ€™ll be playing Donâ€™t Rest your head with a cynical, pisstaking muso who revels in his take-no-prisoners attitude, but said to me that he respects my taste, and if I find something interesting in it then heâ€™ll give it a go. A bit like what Jeff (Droog) said, but more so.<br/><br/>* one of whom is now the drummer in Coldplay. Thus endeth the anecdote.                        </div>

Brand kinda covered this, but since you asked:<br/><br/>I would cite their reasons as <br/>1) people they already know and are comfortable joking around with will be the only ones there <br/>2) they won't be just learning the rules while people they don't know sit around and tap their feet and look impatient<br/>3) since we all admit the presence of losers in the hobby, they won't be risking hanging out with total losers<br/>4) they'll already be at work, so its not like they have to drive the opposite direction from their home to go to my house<br/><br/>As for the bowling comparison, I think thats not far off - like if I told them I bowled in a league or something and wanted to introduce them to the sport, I think it's totally understandable they wouldn't want their first time to be on 'league night' with a bunch of people who are serious about it.                        </div>

I have a hard enough time admitting I write poetry and Science Fiction, my music tastes, and loving to read never mind gaming.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>Do the golfers you know have this concern? Why are you deciding to treat it like what you're afraid it will be?</blockquote>
I don't know any golfers.  I imagine they don't have this concern, but golfing has entirely different connotations in American culture.  Golfers, stereotypically, are affluent white men; fifty years ago, it was the relaxation of choice for middle-aged alpha males.  (I guess you no longer need to be affluent, white, or male to play, but I bet that's still a sizeable demographic.)  If there are negative connotations to playing golf--other than that it's kind of boring--I don't know what they are.  <br/><br/>Gamers, in the culture at large, are stereoptypically middle-middle-class white male pseudo-intellectuals, prone to living in their mom's basements, have trouble getting laid, hate sports, and who would rather obsess over a fantasy world, than live in the real one.  (This is, clearly, an unfair cariacature, but I think that's the perception that exists.)  If there are positive aspects to gaming, they're not apparent in popular culture.  <br/><br/>Part of the trouble I had in my little story is that in the first year of law school, everyone is the same status in theory--which means, in practice, everyone is hyper-status-conscious.  When I was working, the only status relationships that were impossible to ignore were between me and my boss, and me and my subordinates; the rank of someone in another department didn't much matter except in extreme cases.  If it came up that I game at work, well, it'd be a little silly, but I wouldn't much care who knew.    <br/><br/>The closest parallel I can find to the social atmosphere is high school (though it's nowhere near as toxic).  Who here was "out" about gaming as high school?  And, was that a big deal or not?                        </div>

                            1) I've always been more-or-less open about my gaming (more-or-less, because I tend to be pretty private/shy in general).<br/><br/>In high school, we tried to get a Cyberpunk game going during lunch break on a number of occasions and I don't think we ever tried to hide this from anyone else, but we were all already nerds/geeks/etc., so it probably didn't matter.  In college, I always had a few RPG books around my room, but I didn't go out of my way to talk about gaming and I did not seek out the openly active gamers on campus.  I kept playing RPGs during summer break with my "hometown" group, but I was slowly disengaging from the hobby.<br/><br/>Since getting back into gaming over the last few years, I've been pretty open about it.  I've told my co-workers about it (like, when they've asked: "What are you doing tonight?" "Oh, I'm going to play RPGs with some buddies"), although I don't think my co-workers really know what I am talking about.  <br/><br/>I think all of my friends know that I am into gaming.<br/><br/>2) I've had good experiences introducing people to gaming.<br/><br/>My friend Nick has to play a lot of (mostly video) games for work as "research", so about two years ago, he tried out D&amp;D3 because he thought it would be a good idea to know something about the game.  Anyway, that experience turned out to be a disaster, but a few months later I convinced him that there were all these other games that worked quite differently and that I was certain he would dig.  I was right!<br/><br/>My friend Andy is a writer and when I brought up PTA in conversation one day, he was really interested in trying it out.  We got a group together and played out a season (which was one of the best RPG-experiences of my life!).<br/><br/>I've also re-introduced some people to the hobby: My friends Mark and Ed hadn't played RPGs since high school (some kind of D&amp;D and GURPS, respectively).  Mark showed interest in playing The Shab-al-Hiri Roach when I explained the concept to him, so we tried it out and had a great time.  Mark talked up the experience to Ed, who was interested enough to tag along with us to the first JiffyCon.  He played in a game of Schock: that blew his mind (only a little hyperbole there).<br/><br/>An aside on the golfer thing:<br/><br/>Like, I golf (a couple of times a year on a course, maybe a half-a-dozen trips a year to the driving range), but I'm not a "golfer".  Maybe this is all tied up with there being no real concept of playing RPGs casually.                        </div>

                            I never had any problems telling anyone I was a gamer since my second year of high school. I would just say "Yep, after school I'm playing this game with some friends, but I can call you after that?" to my hot Asian girlfriend and she would say, "Okay, I have to do homework anyway..." I gamed with football players and cheerleaders, rich kids and poor kids, the only requirement was that you could speak English and were willing to give it a shot. I was a pretty popular kid as far as "smart kids" went. Nobody gave me any shit about it. It might have made some difference that I went to a relatively small-town school where almost everyone was together all the time.<br/><br/>Nowadays I call them "story games" because that's more what I'm after with them. "Got any weekend plans?" "The usual weekend story game...this one is about guns and spies and explosions." (or "elves and monsters and swordfights" or whatever) I've gotten a lot of people saying "damn that sounds cool". <br/><br/>There is a huge, huge element of class involved in any conversation about "cool" in America. I am white, wear a tie to work every day, and have a professional degree. Thus when I say I'm doing something not quite mainstream it's received very differently than if someone who doesn't make as much money as I do says it.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I'm pretty comfortable with being a guy that plays roleplaying games. Nobody else thinks I'm a freak for doing it. Some people have even been interested, and a few have played games with me.</blockquote>Same here. I've introduced quite a few new gamers into the hobby the last years, mostly by going "Hmm, I think she'd be totally into gaming." and then just running a game for them. So far, it worked.<br/><br/>I also explain anybody who ask what they are about and I have never had a bad experience with that. When one of my coworkers at the Red Cross asked what I was doing on the net, I told then I was surfing on a games website. (And when he wanted to know more, I told him, explained a bit about how they work and so on.) When another coworker (Technically one of my superiors.) there saw me reading D&amp;D books, he asked and got an even more in-depth explanation. Now, none of them showed much interest, but then not all people will. Still they treated me just the same later and I have never heard any stupid comments regarding me being a gamer.<br/><br/>(Nice although only tangentially related story: A friend works at one of the local FLGSs and I often visit him, talk a bit and look at the new things. A few weeks ago, during the pre-holidays shopping crazyness, I stayed there more or less the whole day, helping out now and then when a customer wanted to know a bit about a specific game. That day, I met somebody I didn't think existed: Somebody who had no idea what an RPG was and who went to the FLGS to find out. ^_^ Turns out one of his friends had told him about gaming ages ago, he never really asked more and just wanted to know what this was all about. It was an interesting experience, explaining gaming to this guy who was much older then the typical gaming customer, who had no idea about gaming but was really interested and seemed to like what I told him about it. He also had zero prejudices, listened intently and was very friendly and nice. It once again strengthened my opinion that, at least here in Austria, the average person has no idea about gaming, no prejudices, nothing. To most people, gaming is, if they know about it at all, just another hobby.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm with Levi: This whole "Geek Anxiety" thing is just in our heads. <br/><br/>M                        </div>

I suppose the key thing to understand in that scene is that, despite my fears, she had <em>absolutely no idea what roleplaying games were</em>.  No preconceptions whatsoever.  As it turns out, she's plenty nerdy herself, so she didn't think the concept was weird, once I explained it.   Although she's not really a "gamer", she can dig video games and board games, and lately she's been visiting the hobby shop more than I have...<br/><br/>The moral, as has been stated here several times: this is a much bigger deal in our own heads than it is to anyone else.  Just own your enthusiasms like a regular person and life will be a lot more fun.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Matt, on subculture... geek culture, like it or not, does provide one really important function for gaming that it probably doesn't need to for other geek hobbies. It provides a library of common culture that we use to converge on a SIS. To my mind, that's something that doesn't get enough attention from a lot of indie design. If you want to get away from the assumptions of geek culture, you have to have some symbolic library to replace it with, or solid procedures for creating one in play.</blockquote>
I think this might be a source of some of the embarrassment. If all your tales of what you do in gaming revolve around geeky niche genres, there's some difficulty figuring out how to relate that to somebody unfamiliar with these non-mainstream media without sounding like you just stepped out of the mothership.<br/><br/>Joe's advice above on how to break things down and focus on common points to relate to seems like excellently wise advice; I think I'll take it to heart.                        </div>

I think that's partially true, but also hugely missing the point.<br/><br/>Minx, you've already gone on record saying, basically "Nope, never seen that specific problem that you describe. Carry on. We're good here for the most part."<br/><br/>I think that's dangerously close to something like "Well, <i>I've</i> never been sick, so there's really no need to wash my hands. Never seen a germ, never had one in me. Carry on!"<br/><br/>The point I've been trying to hammer into people, and failing miserably is this: <br/> <br/>It's not about feeling shame that one is a geek. The point instead is lamenting the fact that the activity of role-playing is, to date, inextricable from the identity of being a geek within and without the subculture. <br/><br/>Basically, no one "outside" the subculture is doing the activity as we recognize it. (Yes, there are unrelated fanfic freeformers on Yahoo Groups or something -- can we  agree that they aren't exactly un-geeked?)<br/><br/><br/>Everyone else keeps making assumptions that conflate the activity with the subculture. I don't care if someone brings someone else into the fold. I care if that someone can bring the activity out of it!                        </div>

Matt - I wasn't specific in my post about introducing folks to gaming, but, for the record, these guys haven't really joined the subculture.  They just decided that playing RPGs was a cool activity that they like to do sometimes (once or twice a year).  I think that the whole "playing games casually" thing is pretty important, which is partly what I was getting at with my aside about playing golf vs. being a golfer.                        </div>

                            Got a couple of data points:<br/><br/>In a recent conversation with my new pastor, I mentioned that I played roleplaying games.  In fact, I mentioned that I played and designed games, because I was talking a bit about the Forge and Internet discourse.  Turns out that he played D&amp;D back in the day.  As a result, I was able to discuss some Polaris game sessions that were particularly meaningful to me.  Indeed, it turned into a point of contact, and it became a gateway to expressing a bit of myself to him.<br/><br/>Got into a conversation with a co-worker when he saw a copy of Dogs in the Vineyard on my desk.  He's a big Western fan, and we had already talked about Dust Devils, so he had some context for what the game.  Honestly, we have lots of conversations like that.  He's a ex-contractor, and I hate working with tools, but we get along just fine.  In fact, those points of difference are frequently where we center our conversation.  He learns about computers and roleplaying games; I learn about drywall and Clint Eastwood.  I find it to be very educational.<br/><br/>Honestly, in general, my only concern about talking about roleplaying is if I'm concerned that I'll have to do the "RPGs aren't Satanic" conversation.  Those conversations can be tricky, and I generally want to be a bit closer to the person to have that conversation.  (Not necessarily, though....)  Aside from that, I could care less.  It's what I do, and I don't care if others know about it.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>

                            Matt, I think at this point it would be difficult for anyone not to have gotten that point from you. You may have to admit the possibility that this thread isn't directly about your point:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I'm going to tell a story about getting "outed" as a gamer last Spring, which was really humiliating.  But first I want to say my purpose of the thread is as follows:<br/><br/>1.  For people to discuss being "out" as gamers, being outed, etc.<strong>based on personal experience.</strong>(I'm sure everyone has an opinion on this, or can invent one with a few moments' notice, but I don't want empirical signal to be lost in theoretical noise.)<br/><br/>2.  To discuss attemps to bring new people into gaming, which actually worked<strong>based on personal experience</strong>(ditto.)<br/></blockquote>
Here, and in the other thread, I see people addressing your point
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>lamenting the fact that the activity of role-playing is, to date, inextricable from the identity of being a geek within and without the subculture.</blockquote>
and suggesting that those of us already in the hobby, who are socially normal, not treat the hobby like its a disease.  I grant your point, I full-on agree that there's too much association between the hobby and a perception of social outcasts. What I, and other posters, have repeatedly said is that 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>The idea that its only for weirdos can only persist if only weirdos admit to the hobby</blockquote>.<br/><br/>I can't choose how other people perceive roleplaying; I can only choose whether or not their only exposure to it is through people I think are (frankly) less socially 'normal' than me. Let me ask you this, Matt:<br/><br/>What action or actions are you proposing on the part of your readers?                        </div>

Matt, I understand you pretty clearly, and that's not why I started this thread (at least not precisely why).  I started this thread to discuss being open about the hobby, and getting more people to play.  How they play is (for me) a second-order problem.<br/><br/>There are several related issues here:<br/>1.  Being a geek is a social stigma (which, as some people have said, is largely self-inflicted)<br/><br/>2.  Role-playing games are considered geeky (which, if I understand it, is what you'd like to see change)<br/><br/>3.  So long as (1) and (2) hold, in some social situations it's awkward to be a gamer<br/><br/>4.  So long as (1) and (2) hold, it's hard to find people willing to give gaming  a try.<br/><br/>I'm primarily interested in (3) and (4); the earlier points are only significant as they feed into that.  And also, I'm only interested in hearing about (3) and (4) with empirical testimony or critique.                        </div>

                            I recently started a new job, and where I used to have one thing to get out of the way early on (being gay), now I have two (+being a gamer). They're basically the same process - something that could cause an negative shift in my cow-orkers perceptions of me that are important to my life, that I would rather not exclude from conversation. Once I made the connection between the two it became a lot easier. Now, to be fair, I have a job in a rather atypical environment, but still... I had to submit writing samples to get the job, and one of the samples I submitted was my Ronnies entry, and within weeks of starting here I inaugurated a New York office RPG group, which includes old-skool grognards and complete novices. We're finishing a trip up the Witch's Mountain tomorrow night. I do a few things that help:<br/><br/>- I refuse to behave as though being [gay | a gamer] is shameful. I introduce my boyfriend, and I introduce gaming in to conversation as an out-of-work activity that I revel in. Just like my colleagues talk about wifes, babies, soccer and World of Warcraft.<br/>- I talk about what excites me about gaming - making hard choices in unexpected situations, and making shit up.<br/>- I don't let anyone give me shit without giving them a whole bucket of shit back.<br/><br/>That last one is key, I think. Someone wants to point out how dorky your obsession is? At least I don't get dressed up in nylon shorts to play my games.<br/><br/>YMMV,<br/>Alexander                        </div>

Well, here goes then.  In my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1847&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Alyria AP</a> report, I mention James.  James is 36, a father of six, and the vice-president of the non-profit where I work.  He's also a long-time friend of mine.  This game of Alyria was essentially the first real roleplaying experience that he had.  (He seems to recall being involved in a session of something RPG-like involving tommy-guns when he was in high school, but that's about it.)<br/><br/>The reason that he was involved is because he asked to try out this roleplaying thing.  The reason that he was interested is because I'm his friend, and I made it all sound interesting.  He took to the game quite well, and I think that he enjoyed himself.  Sadly, work obligations will probably keep him from joining us on a regular basis, but I'll bet that, if I offered, he'd be willing to play again.<br/><br/>Would he ever frequent a board like this?  I doubt it.  He'd probably fall into that "casual RPGer" category:  playing if invited, but not necessarily defining himself by the activity.<br/><br/>So, what made the difference?  First, our previous relationship that was based on other things.  Second, my enthusiasm for the hobby which I communicated to him, just like I communicate my enthusiasm about other things.  Third, the game that I chose had no commitment beyond the immediate session, so the "risk" was low.  Fourth, he was treated like an equal participant at the gaming table, not looked down on as being a n00b.<br/><br/>That's it.  It's not really that complicated.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>

                            Dave Younce, for starters I'm NOT suggestng radical reaction. You're doing what I want by acting with common sense and not treating the hobby as a freakshow when confronted by others. Great!<br/><br/>I'm getting this vibe that because I'm talking about uncomforable things, that people are reacting sort of like this "Wow, Matt's really running from the mouth. I think things aren't as bad as he says. Hey Matt, calm down. I think all we need to do is X or Y." To which my reply is, "Um, no kidding. X or Y, naturally! Why do you think I suggested otherwise. Weird."<br/><br/>YOu're seem sort of defensive about me accusing "normal" gamers like you. What, you have to take everything I say as a broadstroke that all gamers are turds? Let's stop worrying about whether I'm calling people out and start admitting that, yep, there are lots of things worth addressing related to this issue. You're already working on those, as are others in this positive thread. Again, great.                        </div>

This is a potent little insight, here.  In reading this thread, I was sort of formulating my own response, and it was going something like "About a year ago I decided I didn't care anymore and now I talk about it with anybody..."  Not coincidentally, about a year ago I switched jobs from office schmuck to line editor -- from running errands to managing budgets.  I'm way the hell more comfortable talking about gaming, sure -- because I'm coming from a more secure social position to start with.<br/><br/>Additionally, although I'm in the minority, I've played D&amp;D exactly once, so when I explain gaming, I almost never use the "like D&amp;D" referent.  When the people I'm talking with bring it up, I compare it to Pong -- it was a foundational game, sure, but by today's standards it's low-tech.  Then I tell them about Breaking the Ice.  (Yes, there is a little D&amp;D-hate in there, but quite frankly, about a year ago, I decided I didn't care about stuff like that.)                        </div>

Reminds me of bringing my then-girlfriend into gaming -- I hadn't been running anything when we'd started dating, and about six or seven months into the relationship, I was planning to start something up and I wanted to tell her about it and explain what it was and see if she was interested.  I was incredibly nervous -- fear of rejection, all that -- and I go through the speil and explain everything and I get to the end with a sort of "So....?"<br/><br/>And there's this long pause.  LONG pause.  She's kind of fidgeting with her hands, thinking.  Finally, in this small, unsure voice that tells me she's worried that *I* am about to shun *her*, she says:<br/><br/>"Can... Can I play a witch?"<br/><br/>It was a beautiful moment. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  We're not together anymore and haven't been in awhile, but she still games in our group's regular campaigns, absent any pressure from an S.O. -- usually she pushed for Sorcerer or Catan.                        </div>

That right there is friggin' adorable.<br/><br/>And this question comes to mind whenever the whole outing thing does: how many of us have other aspects to our lives that we'd might prefer not to be outed (or that others might imagine we'd prefer not to have outed), and how does our handling of that out-able relate to our gaming lives?                        </div>

I talked about this a bit in my post.<br/><br/>Basically, I take the same approach in letting someone into ANY aspect of my life. If it's a more sensitive topic, I am a lot more succinct and I go into more details. If the question is posed in an environment that feels unsafe, I tend to answer, briefly, and say "Wanna go grab a coffee and talk about it" or "I'd rather not talk about that here, but I'm comfortable sharing it elsewhere". Both tend to be met fairly well, although the second is quite a lot more abrupt and "...oh. okay."                        </div>

Amusingly, most my social deviancies I forget to mention until I've known somebody for months or years.  It gets to the point where then I feel trapped because mentioning it <em>then</em> feels weird.  (The poor, beleagured state of being bi and marrying somebody of the opposite sex: it's like the world suddenly forgets your gender.)<br/><br/>Now, this gets back to the suggestion that defining gaming as "an aspect of your life" is perhaps overstating things.  I'm not sure I'm sold on that, but for others that may be the key to responding to your question, Judson.                        </div>

                            I've been blessed with optimism and a kind of natural confidence that allowed me to either ignore implied criticisms or talk so positively about the hobby that I haven't really had negative outing experiences.  But the stigma is there and still bothering me at times, though only when people I know and care about fall for it.<br/><br/>For example, I talked to my dad last weekend.  He's in Germany (naturally), I've lived here in the States for almost seven years now.  We chat about politics, life, and such.  He asks if I still roleplay, which I confirm.  So he says: "Isn't it time at some point not to live in a fantasy world anymore?"<br/><br/>Dude--WTF?  I've been in the same professional job for over 3 years, earned a graduate degree, am raising three kids, have a mortgage... and you think I live in a fantasy world?  But, you know, that's his understanding of the activity.  And it's not completely off track; but to think that somehow my whole life is somehow removed from reality because of my hobby, that's messed up.                        </div>

That's why I don't watch television, go to the theater, read books, play games, tell stories, watch sports, go to church, or (especially) roleplay. =P                        </div>

I'm 30 years old, pursuing a very respected profession, and yet I really enjoy throwing dice around and talking about dragons and tommy-guns.  I suppose there's nothing wrong with it, but it's still a curious use of one's time.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Amusingly, most of my social deviancies I forget to mention until I've known somebody for months or years.  It gets to the point where then I feel trapped because mentioning it <em>then</em> feels weird.  (The poor, beleagured state of being bi and marrying somebody of the opposite sex: it's like the world suddenly forgets your gender.)<br/><br/>Now, this gets back to the suggestion that defining gaming as "an aspect of your life" is perhaps overstating things.  I'm not sure I'm sold on that, but for others that may be the key to responding to your question, Judson.</blockquote>
Well, yeah.  I'm more and more thinking that "gaming" is like any other part of a person's identity, and that what aspects of the self you share with people is a personal decision.  I consciously ignore the impulse to conceal gaming, or to feel like it's weird to mention it months into an acquaintance.  And I do fine.<br/><br/>But I also tend to feel that I don't owe the world a complete picture of my self - there are parts that I'm entitled to keep private until such time as I care to reveal them, and there was a time there when my weekly game of Unknown Armies was one of those.  I know from experience that there's people who do associate stigmas with all kinds of interests, activities, preferences and beliefs, including some that I claim; and I do see a correlation in my own mind between my behaviors regarding them.<br/><br/>I guess I'm mostly reacting to:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Oh, and a quick thing about the word "outed" -- there have been a couple threads about this on the Forge, and on RPGNet, from time to time.  And usually, either a gay gamer, or a gamer worried about gays, will suggest that the word "outed" doesn't belong to gamers to use for this phenomenon.<br/></blockquote> </div>
