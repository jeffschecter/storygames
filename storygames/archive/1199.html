                    I understand that I missed out on a big conversation at Gencon about stakes-setting and conflict resolution and such.  I'm very curious to know what was said.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone summarize for me, or perhaps just post a few key points that were discussed?                </div>

                            Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking maybe a Q&amp;A will be the best way to do this. I'll start by asking myself a question and answering it, and then you guys just fire questions from there. If you could, try not to dogpile me, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why do you have a bug up your ass about this Stakes thing? All sorts of people are using the term and their games rawk.<br/>
<br/>
A: "Rawk," right now, is not yet evidence of the games working out for consistently fun play across a whole bunch of different people, outside the immediate community. I do not yet acknowledge that we have rawking as a consistent feature across most of the games offered for sale at the booth this year. I'm seeing a feature in many which will instead be a consistent trip-up of fun, despite essentially sound and powerful game design, especially in Currency. That feature is pre-narration of outcomes and calling it "stakes."<br/>
<br/>
What I'm seeing with this stakes-type play that's got up my ass is this: not fun. I'm seeing the same thing that is probably familiar to all of us, but in a new guise. The familiar thing is this:<br/>
<br/>
GM: Make your stealth roll to get past the guard.<br/>
Player: Made it!<br/>
GM: You get past that guard and the other guards surround you.<br/>
Player: What? Total ass! My roll says I made it through!<br/>
GM: No, your roll says you got past that one guard. That's what I said.<br/>
<br/>
(Totally annoying conversation ensues, all about what "would" happen and "if that happens then this," and similar. Note that the same thing could happen if the player were being an asshat about a roll's outcome instead of the GM.)<br/>
<br/>
So what's the new thing? The same interaction, only before the roll rather than after it.<br/>
<br/>
GM: The demon-guy is going to burn the book with your mother's secret letters in it!<br/>
Player in PTA, playing Buffy (by whatever name): That demon has gone too far this time. I kick his ass!<br/>
GM: If I win, then your mother falls in love with him!<br/>
Player: Oh yeah? If I win, then his dick shrivels up!<br/>
<br/>
It's the same chesting (not "chest-beating," a listening-error made by some people that evening, but rather butting and shoving with chests) as in the previous example - but positioned before the roll, not after.<br/>
<br/>
It can go on to pretty absurd extremes, with people really expanding the scope ("if I win, the school burns down!!" "If I win, you're really a man in disguise!"), but it's not that absurdity I'm talking about, but the basic structural problem.<br/>
<br/>
People who say, "But we have fun! This works! You're just inveighing against something you don't like, <i>as usual,</i> Edwards!" are using exactly the same argument that used to be applied to the older version. "It worked for us!" Why? Because they enjoy chesting with one another, and have little to no interest in whether the demon-guy burns the book or whether he gets his ass kicked. All in-game conflicts are present only for the opportunity to chest. Any minute now, they'll say "you just have to find the right group" to support their point, which is no argument at all.<br/>
<br/>

                            (continued)<br/>
<br/>
I discovered at the conversation that most of the authors whose games have this feature fully understand it as a problem, and did not intend for their use of "stakes" to be used in this fashion. Jason, based on what you said there, I think this is your situation, when you said, "The text in The Roach is ambiguous" about it. I agree. I do not think the Roach rules <i>advocate</i> this kind of nonsense, but I do think they lend themselves to it in the same way that many traditional rules-sets lent themselves to the early version of the same problem.<br/>
<br/>
I am seeing a serious issue in play-reports, too. In posts about the very games I'm seeing this "stakes" talk in, I'm seeing frustration and fatigue in attempted play, especially from the most important group, the people who bought the game upon reading fun posting about it, but without direct contact with the designer and acquaintances. You can like me or not like me, but I do suggest that my experience with reading and assessing actual play reports might bear a little respect ... enough, at least, to take a second look for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
And this is a serious issue. Until now, one thing we could always say was that if you bought a game that had been "baked at the Forge," you could fucking well play it. Dust Devils? My Life with Master? Universalis? Elfs? Like them or not, confused about a detail or not, you could open the book and sit down and actually play, and decide for yourself if it was your thing. If we lose that, we lose the single most important thing about independent publishing, that it can produce playable games more consistently than the other sorts of publishing. (Note: <i>more consistently</i>, not "always")<br/>
<br/>
OK, that's my answer to my own question, to start off the discussion if anyone's interested. That's what I'm talking about and that's why I have a bug up my ass about it. I'd love to answer further questions.<br/>
<br/>
I also think the link to the Forge thread is really important for understanding all this too, because it's based on actual play and therefore can be utilized to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Jason, I thought that look of glazed intensity on your face was evidence that I was both convincing and riveting ... now I realize it was your Hunter S. Thompson moment, trying to maintain while desperately ignoring "your grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in her teeth," as he would say.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. I just realized a question I can expect is, "which games are you picking on, specifically?" There's a fair version of that question, merely seeking pure information in order to understand my point, and there's a shitty version of that question, which is designed to paint me as a bully and a game-picker-onner. On the internet, they're indistinguishable. I'm going to have to ignore that question, and will choose games for examples as fairly as possible, as issues come up, like I did with the Roach in this one.                        </div>

                            I think the problem is that there is no mechanical limit on the creative storytelling aspect of the games you're describing.  That's true for either stakes before rolling, or snarky storytelling after the rolling.<br/>
<br/>
The first example (with the guards) would work if the GM could show the player the scenario was already setup.  "So, you've got a couple of aces huh?  Well read 'em and weep boys -- I've got a full house!"  Maybe the GM has to show the "more guards" card, or that it's written down in the module someplace. "See -- page 13 says '1 guard at the door, and 3 guards hiding in the room.'<br/>
<br/>
The second example (stakes) would work if there was a limit on how high you could take the stakes -- which is an inherant problem I see with a lot of games with open-ended narrative construction as part of the gameplay.  You need an agreement (usually unspoken) not to go too far with your story-telling (stakes or otherwise).  That doesn't mean the game can't be fun, but it does mean you can't play competitively -- which is a problem for some gamers.  It's not a competitive game, it's collaborative storytelling and should take it's cues from theatre sports more than wargames / boardgames / etc.                        </div>

                            Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dave</b><br/>
<br/>
Quick clarifier: please, folks, chesting, not chest-beating. Really. I'm talking about something really specific. Imagine two people trying to occupy the same space, arms at their sides, pushing at one another and shifting their weight to throw the other off-balance, with their chests. Not chest-beating.<br/>
<br/>
That's a good question. There are some good examples out there that work well, even with setting-changing and back-story-changing elements of outcome-narration.<br/>
<br/>
Working well type 1: Universalis is about practically nothing else, actually - after a Complication, people get to spend points/Coins on stuff that results, like blowing up buildings or planets or what-have-you. But this is after the Complication dice are rolled, not before, so maybe it's not quite what you were asking about.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stick with Universalis anyway for just a minute, because I'm trying to get across the idea that scope and scale aren't really the problem, as long as the currency of the outcome or the understood range of the narration is clear and usable, and when you simply move right into the resolution system (and its rules for narration) when the basic conflict of interest among characters is established - and by "move right into," I really mean, move into it right away.<br/>
<br/>
Working well type 2: Polaris is probably the poster child of pre-narrated outcomes which work well, because it contains a formal de-escalation mechanism - "you ask far too much." De-escalation cancels chesting.<br/>
<br/>
Working well type 3 (provisional): Conflict resolution in Capes involves a lot of outcome-oriented narration, including a lot of provisional stuff that doesn't happen once the rolls finally shake out. I think it works because of the extremely focused currency-system that underlies its use. With Great Power ... poses a series of questions about this, as does Shock. I'd like to play both of them extensively before being confident in any points I'd make.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Levi</b><br/>
<br/>
The guards-after-the-guards problem is already solved, and has been for about four or five years now, among the body of games that I'm talking about. It's solved by focusing on the conflict of interest that the dice are solving.<br/>
<br/>
In the older, task-oriented approach, the two people failed to define the task at hand - getting by this guard, or getting through the guards undetected. The system as written would not help you, and groups (a) had to arrive at a consensus about it in order to play such scenes at all; (b) had to jettison dice rolls for such scenes, relying on pure narration; or (c) undergo that asshat-conversation you saw beginning in my example, every damn time.<br/>
<br/>
With conflict resolution, that problem simply disappears. Is the conflict between this very guard and the character? Is it between the character and the Duke, with the guard as a proxy/medium for the Duke? Whose <i>interests</i> are really opposed such that we even want to roll dice in the first place? The "free and clear" pre-roll phase in Sorcerer, the "say yes or roll the dice" principle in Dogs, and related statements and rules across many 2001-2003 game texts are all versions of this idea. Upon applying it, the guards-after-the-guards problem vanishes forever.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if the conflict was between this guard and the character (and why? well, the guard would have to be interesting in some way, a priori, and not be just some talking furniture wearing a helmet), then a second conflict about a group of guards is kosher, if it qualifies as a conflict-of-interest on its own. But if the conflict was about sneaking through the guards, period, and let's say the conflict-of-interest is really with the Duke, then hammering the characters with more guards is cheating - you're trying to re-roll an outcome you didn't like, which is asshattery in conflict resolution.<br/>

<p>Dave, Shock: does this by requiring orthogonal Intents. At no point can players set up a situation where one's success inherently requires the other's failure (or success for that matter).</p>
<p>A playlet ensues.</p>

<p>Now, you've got dice, both of you. You get to choose, using the dice, which you want to happen more: your own Intent, or the failure of your opposition.</p>
<p>You say what you want to happen. I say what I want to happen. If I escalate what I want to happen after you've said what you want to happen, it's no big deal; it just means that I didn't really say what I wanted to happen.</p>

Joshua: OK, I'm gonna spend 5 Credits to stop you. I actually think it's OK if you steal it, so I'm only rolling 1d4, but I'm rolling 4d10 that say that they catch the shit out of you.</br></br></p>
<p>Note that there's nothing I can do about your readjusting your stakes. What I can do has no bearing on that. If you say, "I destroy the universe and make a new one, with me as king!" then you might get a bullshit call, but maybe everyone's cool with that. Significantly, everyone at the table gets a mechanical bullshit call, including me, in the form of MinutiÃ¦ and opposition dice, respectively.</p>
<p>Ron, this is the kind of thing you're talking about, right?</p>

<br/>
Regarding Polaris, I think I'm seeing agreement between Ben, Guy, and me, without any question to address.<br/>
<br/>
Rob and Stuart, I think you're asking/saying almost the same thing, so I'll answer you together. Let me know if I've done any damage to your points or questions in doing so.<br/>
<br/>
And my answer is, the key variable is the <i>conflict of interest at hand</i>. The stated constraints on outcome-narration in The Questing Beast are fully functional, because they focus on dealing with that, and perhaps spinning off into a new scene to frame, but no more.<br/>
<br/>
I think as long as the rules make it clear that <i>all</i> narration going on during this part of play should concern the conflict, before &amp; during &amp; after the roll (or draw or whatever), then a wide range of possible scope and effects can be functional. In some games, it could be pretty small, as when players of The Pool use their Monologue of Victory basically to add Color and enjoy their depiction of their character's actions. It could be pretty big, as when players of The Pool use the same rule to inject motivation and a change of heart into a major NPC. Both are kosher, and I definitely think a game rules-text with such techniques does well to illustrate the desired scope &amp; scale as clearly and definitively as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron<br/>

                            With the Guard example, let's imagine that the background to the encounter is that the player was told the Sherrif's counting room contained all the stolen money from the poor peasants, but it would be heavily guarded.  When the hero encounters the lone guard, the player might believe the conflict at hand is that he is going to sneak past him.  What the player <i>doesn't</i> know is that there are more guards hiding in the counting room ready to catch anyone foolhardy enough to just walk in.  The player thinks the encounter is a simple test of their stealth skill, when in fact it's a trap set by the Sherrif.  The important choice the player makes is whether to sneak past the guard, or choose some other course of action (which may reveal the presence of other guards waiting for a thief).<br/>
<br/>
In game terms, this would be most dramatic (and thus work best) if the player does not know the full scope of the conflict up front. To avoid the feeling the other player (GM) is simply being arbitrary, the player of the hero should be able to confirm this situation was pre-existing (written down in the gamebook, a special card in another player's hand, etc)<br/>
<br/>
As for free-form shared narration / plot control -- the problem is the players are almost <i>always</i> being arbitrary.  This can be a lot of fun, like improv comedy / theatre, but it doesn't lend itself to players in direct conflict.  It's more like stage combat.  The players aren't really trying to <i>beat</i> their opponent, but rather create a dramatic situation. I think whether it's stakes before a roll or any other time in the game, misuse "brought about by poor or insufficient explanation" or simply by players working towards different versions of "fun" and "winning" the game could be a problem.  Even calling it a game could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
"Mind's Eye Theatre" is a great term to describe the second style of play (free-form shared narration / plot control), although ironically, the White Wolf system that used that name was actually more like the first example... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I'm not suggesting that competitive games don't have dramatic situations -- just that genuinely competitive play require rules that all the players understand and agree to.  And not all play is genuinely competitive -- play fighting and olympic wrestling might at first glance look very similar, but they're really quite different. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm suggesting free-form narrative games are more like play fighting.  The players have to pull their punches -- they can't go all out to try and win, or it spoils the fun.                        </div>

Surely both terms are equally (if loosely) valid?<br><br>Secondly, and please read this in the Socratic light that it's written, if the negotiated resolution system in <cite>Polaris</cite> works, how does that tie to the conflict at hand being the key variable?  As written, it lends itself, even encourages elements being added that are well out of the scope of the initial conflict.  I can see that "You Ask Far Too Much" acts as a counter to the intentions-are-stakes issue, but it also seems to act as a counter example to focus on conflict.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            In the guard example, there are really two conflicts, but the second one is apparently determined by GM fiat.

                            Jason, do you remember that time we tried to play Polaris at your house?  The one where we killed a bunch of demons with an opera?  I have to say, I think, in that game, we fell victim to the seductive power of stakes setting, where we were more interested in setting crazier and more exciting stakes than we were in the characters and what was happening to them, and so lost our emotional connection to the story.  Having experienced that, I have to argue that this problem can even plague Polaris if it's approached in a certain way.                        </div>

                            PTA probably adds some to the confusion, because the real conflict of interest has to do with the protagonist's issue, and you have to do a little digging around to figure out how it factors into the playing of cards and stuff.<br><br>You're sneaking past guards. Your issue is maybe insecurity, let's say. What's at stake, in terms of the conflict, is your issue. Not the guards. How does what happens in your sneakery affect your issue? You get past them, they spot you. Either outcome could be either a win or a lose as far as your issue is concerned.<br><br>No, you don't say, "if I win, I'm no longer insecure." You do say, "if I win, my character addresses his/her insecurity in a positive way."<br><br>Notice how the conflict of interest is clearly established, but nobody knows what will happen until the narration starts flying.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
Orthogonal vs. opposed intentions is actually a side-issue. It's an <i>important</i> side issue, and I even have little arrows on my diagram from my GenCon notes, but conflict resolution can be applied to both.<br/>
<br/>
Orthogonal (heâ€™s grabbing the vase; sheâ€™s shooting him) as well as (heâ€™s stabbing her; sheâ€™s stabbing him) because each pair of actions has four identifiable outcomes<br/>
<br/>
Utterly opposed (heâ€™s grabbing the vase; sheâ€™s stopping him from doing so) because this pair only has two identifiable outcomes<br/>
<br/>
Again, a given game system really ought to make it clear which is which, and how each is handled by the resolution mechanics, or if the game favors one over the other. But my real point is that all my points about stakes apply to both, and distinguishing between the two is, um, well, orthogonal to the topic at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Sorcerer veterans can see that both kinds are permissible through that game's system. Full Defense, for example, is choosing to be fully oppositional during combat, as opposed to the default approach, which is orthogonal with built-in oppositional options. The confusing bit is that very basic resolution in the game has oppositional as its default. It all works, but you have to go back-and-forth in your thinking while learning it. HeroQuest players will recognize it too, in very similar ways. Trollbabe, on the other hand, tends to be all-orthogonal, all the time; The Pool, in my view, tends to play better if the group keeps things toward the oppositional end.<br/>

I see two issues in your post. One concerns knowledge of what-all's going on that could be affected by the conflict's outcome; you're saying that in some cases, full knowledge is not available to least one party and that's cool. I totally agree. The little diagram I made of conflict resolution (I'm looking for it in my GenCon notes) should make it clear that nothing about that is a problem for what I'm saying. I'm <i>not</i> saying that conflict resolution is always handled by a bird's-eye-view, total-knowledge approach. I'll get that diagram up once I find the notes and cope with some way to represent it.<br/>
<br/>
The other issue concerns shared narration, plot control, "story control" (whatever that is), and aspects of competition or display all mixed in there ... I agree with what you're saying and don't see much else to say.<br/>

To what I'm describing, the chesting-thing strikes me as an apt physical analogy with no need for qualifying or fixing or explaining. I'd rather stick with it on that basis and not try to bring in other images.<br/>

I can see that "You Ask Far Too Much" acts as a counter to the intentions-are-stakes issue, but it also seems to act as a counter example to focus on conflict.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
Sorry man ... I'll invoke my as-yet-internet-invisible diagram again. Suffice to say that conflict resolution, in some systems, can be <i>highly</i> modified in terms of what's up and what's happening as you go along. Polaris has a lot in common with The Shadow of Yesterday in that the conflict-topic can shift and change under you as it goes along. That's all formalized and stepwise and understandable, though, and it has nothing to do with the pre-mechanics chesting thing.<br/>

<div class="QuoteText">In the guard example, there are really two conflicts, but the second one is apparently determined by GM fiat. It appears as though he other guards did not have to roll anything to ambush the PC. In this regard, I am surprised that Burning Wheel hasn't been mentioned yet. The requirement to state the intent of an action, along with the Let It Ride rule, seem like a wonderful approach to solving the guard issue and all related issues of succeeding at a task but having one's intent violated.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
Dude, I can't cite <i>every</i> game that exemplifies every point, not on first post anyway. The answer is "yes." Let It Ride is very much about whether X is or isn't a conflict in the developing fiction, and it's strongly related to "say yes or roll the dice." Let It Ride is a lot like what I stress a lot in Sorcerer play, that <i>after</i> you've run the resolution system, there aren't any do-overs. That conflict was <i>resolved</i>.<br/>
<br/>
So it's not really different from what I'm talking about at all. "Say yes or roll the dice" is about going into conflicts and saying "yup, this is worth a roll," and Let It Ride is about what you do when you've done it, which is to say, accept it and say "system matters, that is resolved, move on." They totally go together and require one another.<br/>

Double-plus good on that one.

In a competitive sense it's like a bluff or feint.  Trick the other player into trying to go for an easy success, then make your real move while they're off balance.  This only works in a game where your opponent could have made a different decision to avoid your bluff -- otherwise it would seem more like cheating.<br/>
<br/>
In a narrative / classic GM-controlled RPG or Gamebook, it's like a trap/puzzle for the player to overcome.  There are clues that they can use to avoid the situation (I was told it was heavily guarded, but there's only one guard here).  It changes the conflict resolution mechanism from chance to problem solving / strategy (which many players find more rewarding).                        </div>

Completely acceptable - so long as the diagram becomes visible sometime soon.  You have me on the edge of my seat wanting to see it.<br><br>Especially in the light of Jonathan's comments about <cite>Polaris,</cite> though, I'm prone to relate this to a misbehavior of a variety of system's my designer's group has run across: that the mechanics and the fiction seem to run at cross purposes.  That without a lot of player investment to keep a game on the rails, the rules actively encourage bizarre flights of fancy and wacky improvisation that tend to run roughshod over any SIS or character development.  Does that make sense, does it echo any of your own experience, and would you tend to align that with the "chesting" phenomenon you're describing or not?                        </br></br></div>

                            Wow. I have gone from 100% certainty about what Ron is saying, to zero percent, and now back to something like 85%. This thread (and the Forge thread) have been very helpful. I <i>really</i> want to see the diagram.<br><br>I think it's safe to say that a lot of misccomunication for me was semantic (particularly regarding "outcome" and "intent" and how those things interact with free-and-clear phases of conflict resolution). Also, I've never seen stakes-setting as "chesting" so that whole thing just flew by me without a second glance. The thing that I see happening a lot is what I would call "refinement of intent" during free-and-clear and the establishment of the conflict of interest. We sometimes say "If I win, X" when what we <i>mean</i> is "This thing is my character's goal in the conflict." So, <i>not</i> a prescribed outcome that must be selected from a binary set, but a <i>goal</i>.<br><br>So in PTA, we get this:<br>"You're out on patrol, and vampires attack! They grab people and bite them and drink their blood!"<br>This is not a conflict-worthy thing in PTA. It's just vamps. Big deal. Where's the conflict? Let's go look for it...<br><br>Xander's player: "Okay, I want to try and fight the vampires, to show Buffy that I'm not a coward." Ding. There it is. Xander has a conflict of bravery, which is one of his core issues.<br><br>The player could have said, "If I win, Xander shows Buffy that he's not a coward." Which could raise some flags just sitting there all alone like that. But really, that's just the player articulating his intent in the conflict. It also decouples the blow-by-blow action in the fiction from the conflict of interest. Sure, we're fighting vamps, say the players, but the conflict is about something else. This is the heart of good PTA play.<br><br>I think this what has confused me all along. True, honest-to-goodness <i>outcomes</i> should not be fixed before resolution. But articulation of intent is critical to even establishing a good conflict in the first place. In articulating a goal or intention, a player might talk about an outcome, but this is different from actually fixing that outcome as a carved-in-stone yes/no result.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Judson, thats a thing about Capes play that Tony has been focusing on recently - I would recommend checking out the AP threads linked from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20457.0" rel="nofollow">this post</a>. In short, he's observed over many games of Capes, that the first couple of sessions tend to be wild'n'crazy until the group gets the hang of how narration works. I dunno whether he considers this a bug or a feature of the game, to be honest.<br><br>...<br><br>Here's something that might help solidify exactly whats wrong, in case its needed - I woke up the day after this conversation with this phrase in my head. "Bad stakes setting has you arguing over the stakes. Good stakes setting has you reaching for the dice." Basically, once you know the mechanics are going to be triggered (i.e. a conflict has been established, whatever), and you keep talking instead of engaging with those mechanics, you are probably getting into pre-narration territory.<br><br>Ron, does this phrasing of it strike you as problematic at all? Also, feel free to use <strong>carry</strong> as an example for anything, if something appropriate comes up. <br><br>...<br><br>I don't have any specific questions for you yet, Ron, but there's something sniffing around at the back of my brain that might turn into a question.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I just learned how whispering works. Very erotic! (for those following my Bacchanal threads)<br/>

Turns out <b>Judson</b> wanted me to answer this:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">I'm prone to relate this to a misbehavior of a variety of system's my designer's group has run across: that the mechanics and the fiction seem to run at cross purposes. That without a lot of player investment to keep a game on the rails, the rules actively encourage bizarre flights of fancy and wacky improvisation that tend to run roughshod over any SIS or character development. Does that make sense, does it echo any of your own experience, and would you tend to align that with the "chesting" phenomenon you're describing or not?</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
My answer: that makes makes tons of sense, and it matches my <i>observational</i> experience of others' games. I've been developing my skills at conflict resolution since maybe 1985, so it doesn't happen much in groups I play with. My take is that such goings-on may well lay a foundation for the "chesting." However, it's not the only foundation; a common one lately is merely confusion.<br/>

                            Nathan,<br><br>You're very right: Tony's AP posts (and the threads that follow them) hit the wider outskirts of the numinous issue I'm having with a sledgehammer.<br><br>On the other hand, "Bad stakes setting has you arguing over the stakes.

OK that makes a lot more sense to me now.

In that canse I suspect I am happy to try using'agreeing the conflict' as a phrase over setting the stakes for what we do in our HeroQuest game. There is an element of agreeing to the magnitude of the conflict for us as well, a kind of how much is at stake here discussion. But I suspect in your terms that is part of the conflict.<br>
<br>
Still I can't help feel that the issue of jouissance of the text will come up here and the term may have already escaped into the wild and beyond your more defined meaning.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ron, I used to think I 'got' conflict resolution, but now I'm not so sure. If I could, may I rephrase what <i>I</i> think conflict resolution is and how it should work, and then you can correct me when I get something wrong?<br><br>First, you need a conflict between the goals of two (or more) fictional characters. The 'thing' they have this conflict over is what's at stake in the conflict, and can be stated explictly (or, I take it, inferred from the goals). Once these are determined (&amp; agreed?), nothing more need be said.<br><br>The resolution system then determines who gets control of those stakes and thus, which goals are met. The resolution system may also determine any side effects or who gets to narrate the exact outcome into the SIS, but they are not defining characteristics of a conflict resolution system.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
All of that is basically correct, Ian. There is one thing I should make clear. The term "stakes" as has been adoped far and wide (with the attendant hassle that has led me to get on this hobby horse) was not generated by me. I never invented it, never used it, never applied it in any way like it's being applied. For me, it's <i>always</i> been the conflict-of-interest as the defining feature.<br/>
<br/>
I did introduce the term "stakes" with my game Trollbabe, but it applied to something vastly different: it's a feature of scenario outcome, signalling the end of a scenario and helping with a few key GM decisions during it. That use is completely unrelated to anything that seems to have been associated with the term since then. I consider my use in Trollbabe to be specific rules-jargon for that game and have never utilized it in any other sense.<br/>
<br/>
Since the use of "stakes" has been vague at best, misleading at the most common, and conducive to un-fun play at worst, I do not consider it a good candidate for inclusion in the Model vocabulary. So your statement above makes most sense to me when one just clips out all the phrases with stakes in them and let the other, sufficient phrases stand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>WARREN</b><br/>
<br/>
That's a pretty good paraphrase. You might notice that the term "stakes" can simply be removed from your statement without any harm to the basic concepts being described. It is not present, for instance, in my own definition of Conflict Resolution in the <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Provisional Forge Glossary</a></b>.
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Conflict resolution<br/>
A Technique in which the mechanisms of play focus on conflicts of interest, rather than on the component tasks within that conflict. When using this Technique, inanimate objects are conceived to have "interests" at odds with the character, if necessary. Contrast with Task resolution.</div>
</blockquote>
(for clarity, I hope)
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Task resolution<br/>
A Technique in which the Resolution mechanisms of play focus on within-game cause, in linear in-game time, in terms of whether the acting character is competent to perform a task. Contrast with Conflict resolution.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
It seems to me that your paraphrase matches pretty exactly with my existing definition.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I found my notes and am transcribing the diagram. Remember, it's an easy bog-stupid "I knew that" diagram; it just makes it easier to point out where various points or inquiries fall relative to the other features of a given conflict resolution procedure.<br/>

                            Ron, I'm looking at your examples from back in your first post in this thread.  Everybody really needs to be on the same page with respect to the conflict.  They need to be able to agree to the scope, scale and focus of the conflict, and respect that when they're setting their stakes.  I don't see any real difference between that and a non-stakes conflict resolution system.<br><br>Is there something about stakes based resolution that makes it any more prone to the chesting phenomenon than any other conflict resolution system?  If so, what?                        </br></br></div>

                            Jamey, I don't know how to say it any differently. Adding this whole "stakes" thing is an intrusive, unnecessary, accident-prone step. You don't need it for conflict resolution, and when you do it (beyond the careful delineations of characters' intent best described above by John Harper), problems arise all too easily.<br/>
<br/>
To me, your question is like asking why a turtle isn't still a turtle if you Crazy Glue a steeple to its back. Sure it's still a turtle. But it's not a better turtle this way; it was capable of doing all the things turtles do before you put the steeple on there; and now that it has the steeple, its capacity to do turtle-things well has been compromised.<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying, get rid of the damn steeple. The turtle was fine without it.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron<br/>

P.S. Andy, the diagram's almost done.                        </div>

                            Oh yes ... the above post does not apply to games which have a <i>systematic, during-resolution</i> method of establishing outcomes prior to the final resolution. Capes and Polaris are the most clear/dramatic examples.<br/>
<br/>
My objections are specifically targeting this business of stakes as pre-narrated outcomes that get established <i>before</i> moving into the resolution procedures. That is why I am calling it a structural problem.<br/>

                            I've been following this discussion pretty closely and if I'm not mistaken this is what I'm seeing:<br>
<br>
Stakes in PtA = Stakes in Dogs = *Goals* in Trollbabe.<br>
<br>
In my Dogs game everything is always stated in terms of what the characters are trying to accomplish.  "We want this guy to acknowledge there's a problem with his behavior."  "We want to expose the Sorcerer as evil to his followers."<br>
<br>
But none of that has to do with the *logistics* of how those goals manifest in the fiction.  Take the exposing the Sorcerer stakes/goal.  This was a real example from my game.  Over the course of applying the resolution mechanic (the see/raise rhythem) things got rather dramatic.  We had gin being turned into maggots, glowing mind controlling glasses, and it all culminated in the Dogs setting the Sorcerer on fire and him standing there laughing like a madman.  So the *outcome* as it has been used here was that all the followers ran away screaming in terror, convinced that their once would be leader was, in fact, insane.<br>
<br>
Now, with out all the meat of the see/raise rhythm I suspect there was no way we could ever have come up with that reaction as a possibility if we were setting stakes like, "If we win the crowd embraces each other in hugs and kisses and shames their cult leader into repentance."  In games with less informative resolution processes like PtA setting stakes like this results in nothing for the narrator do.  When the stakes are "Does Xander Impress Buffy" then the narrator in PtA gets to decide *how that impressiveness manifests* which might very well be, "Buffy runs away in tears thinking she is inadequate." which of course is impossible if the stakes are worded as, "Buffy is so impressed she admits her love for him."<br>

                            Holy Mother of Pearl, I think I get it now.<br/><br/>Seriously, this discussion was baffling the hell out of me. Partly, I think, because the "chesting" behavior described initially by Ron seems really bizarre to me--even in games where my fellow players and I have "set stakes" in the steeple-on-a-turtle way, it was done without the "Oh yeah? Well--" escalation Ron presented. But John and Jesse's posts, and Ron's follow-up posts, have cleared things up immensely.                        </div>

                            Hm.<br/><br/>In the two Cranium Rats playtests I had, people didn't chest, but they kept trying to think and rearticulate their "Stakes", I kept moving forward, I clinched their stakes into a short half a sentence( ;-) ) goal, asked them if it's fine and to reach for the dice.<br/><br/>Heck, in CR it doesn't even matter what the real world outcome is as much as the resolution's mechanical aspect and people do it..                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/><br/>As as I undertood it, the problem with setting the stakes before game mechanics are used is that people may use them to include resolution details and fictional future events before deciding: (a) who wins the intended goal in the conflict; and (b) who has the right to narrate.<br/><br/>Thus, it may easily derive in a subvert fight, reacting to what the other player is introducing in "her stakes" and trying to nail the <i>consequences</i> of the conflict before you really know what is the main outcome or winner side.                        </div>

                            I get what you're saying about the steeple turtle.  It interferes more than it helps.  Maybe I could accept it as truth easier if I'd seen the chesting come out in actual play.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm not getting is the difference between declaration of intent and outright articulation of stakes.  For instance, in John Harper's post between Xander's players statements:<br/><br/>Xander's player: "Okay, I want to try and fight the vampires, to show Buffy that I'm not a coward."<br/>Victory = Buffy is impressed, Failure = Buffy is not impressed.<br/><br/>"If I win, Xander shows Buffy that he's not a coward."<br/>Victory = Buffy is impressed, Failure = Buffy is not impressed.<br/><br/>How do those not fix the result as a yes/no?  They both seem to do the same thing to me, the only real difference being that the first one comes out and describes <i>how</i> he intends to achieve his intent.  That makes it a better phrasing, but they do accomplish the same thing.<br/><br/>Alright.  I'm going to take a few steps back from this, look over some game texts and wait on that diagram.                        </div>

<p>Honestly, I think Stakes are a transitional technology. The important thing is that you be able to propel the story through conflict resolution. Stakes can be implicit if the mechanics are right. I've used them in my games in the past, but in future, they'll be altered or gone mechanically.</p>

                            As far as I can tell, the questions to me are petering out. Iâ€™ll deal with the few that showed up, and then Iâ€™m pretty much ready to end the Q&amp;A and to invite people who want to get into this further to bring actual-play experiences to the Actual Play forum at the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
The promised diagram is finished and getting uploaded &amp; so on. Iâ€™m not sure when thatâ€™ll be done today, but when it is, Iâ€™ll post the link here.<br/>
<br/>
<b>JESSE</b><br/>
<br/>
Youâ€™re right on target by recognizing that some games have a designated narrator for a reason â€“ because various â€œhow we got there, what it looks likeâ€ elements of the procedure are left blank, on purpose. Primetime Adventures offers the most extreme example at the moment, although some others are similar (carry, perhaps).<br/>
<br/>
In Sorcerer, by contrast, thereâ€™s no need to designate a narrator because the free-and-clear phase, plus the back-and-forth decisions of resolving reactions to dice-confrontations, already take care of that. So there are all kinds of ways to slice up the organization of the fact that stuff must be narrated.<br/>
<br/>
Youâ€™re correct in saying that the phenomenon Iâ€™m talking about is especially visible when using a game in which designating a block of that narration plays a key role resolution itself.<br/>
<br/>
Thatâ€™s why saying â€œwhat are the stakesâ€ is so likely to become an intrusive steeple on the turtle of Primetime Adventures play, whereas it sticks out like a sore thumb and is obviously meaningless when brought up in Sorcerer play.<br/>
<br/>
<b>TROY</b><br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, what youâ€™re saying is way off base.<br/>
<br/>
First, this isnâ€™t about â€œbad stakes settingâ€ vs. â€œgood stakes setting.â€ I am saying that the whole term should be tossed out or revised so heavily that we canâ€™t even use the current understanding as a starting point. (So Joshua, I don't even think they are/were transitional. I think the current construction is a blind alley and a serious problem.)<br/>
<br/>
Second, your examples are making specific too many things that can vary functionally. For one thing, â€œintentionsâ€ as described by John Harper above still need to be dissected out a little.<br/>
<br/>
What you need is a good outline or diagram of conflict resolution, and Iâ€™m on my way with that. I am also realizing that this whole issue is getting complicated by people having some difficulty with <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">IIEE</a></b>, and thatâ€™s going to have to get clarified.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ARTURO</b><br/>
<br/>
Absolutely correct. That is what Iâ€™m saying.<br/>
<br/>
<b>JAMEY</b><br/>
<br/>
The problem with this discussion is that Iâ€™m speaking at the level of conflict resolution as it appears across many games, each with its own details of how to organize it, and to answer questions about why Johnâ€™s summary for the Buffy example is valid, we have to look at PTA specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore Iâ€™m absolutely convinced that discussing it further with you, and pretty much with anyone, will require examples from actual play. I invite you to bring a real instance of real resolution, whether it was fun or not-fun, good or bad, whatever you want, from a game which emphasizes conflict resolution, to the Actual Play forum at the Forge. I can show you all kinds of things about it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, whatâ€™s your comfort level with discussing my jargon term IIEE, linked above? I donâ€™t want to get into it if I have to deal with all sorts of resistance.<br/>

Well, it seems to me that there are three basic types of resolution.<br><br>Either someone is <b>empowered</b> to add something to the fiction. <br><br>Or we <b>negotiate</b> the matter and come to an agreement. (There might be rules for the negotiation process or not.)<br><br>And then there are <b>informative mechanics</b>. These rules add relevant information to the fiction, whenever they are invoked. (Presence 4, flame-thrower death tables, etc.)<br><br><br>All these types may be combined in a single process.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            That's obnoxious bullshit, Guy. Other people may put up with it here for some reason, but I don't. The answer <i>is</i>, come and post about it in Actual Play, with experiences from your own real life, and I will clarify exactly what's going on in terms of the confusion Jamey's having, or that you have if you do.<br/>
<br/>
Don't give me this noise about "just an answer to this one point." I am telling you it is not one point, it is not answerable with "just" anything, and you're pissing me off.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to remind you and whoever needs it that Jamey originally wanted to know <i>what was said</i> at this discussion at GenCon. I'm not here to convince him, you, or anyone of anything about the topic; this isn't a debate that I'm entering into. I think it's now pretty clear what was said, so I've fulfilled what I was asked to do. If you want to debate it, then that's your problem.<br/>

<br/>
It's not hard. It's not even very profound. What I drew it for, at the discussion, was to get everyone on the same page about how diverse all the available procedures really are, from different games. I included one of the simplest (or "purest" if you prefer) from PTA, as a reference point.<br/>
<br/>
The real take-home point is that an existing conflict of interest among two or more characters is both required and sufficient to define the first step, and to initiate the procedures of the second.<br/>
<br/>
Given that, then it's easy to see that different games establish tremendously different things in, among, and between the various pieces of the process. PTA waits until the end to fill in all the "how it happened." Sorcerer and Dogs build it bit by bit; Burning Wheel revised even more so. Trollbabe allows for customizing lots of things, e.g. how many exchanges, and sets up stuff for consequences along the way.<br/>
<br/>
But even with all that diversity, the defining and sufficient feature of step 1 remains exactly what it is. That's the "turtle" I was talking about. Maybe the game requires a whole lot of prior descriptive work to get that step established. Or maybe it requires practically nothing, leaving the work of those descriptions for later during the process. Whichever. But what step 1 does <i>not</i> entail doing is adding the steeple of finalized outcomes all the way back there at the beginning; doing so, for the games I'm thinking about (The Roach, PTA, others like them), interferes with the existing mechanisms for the rest of the process.<br/>
<br/>
My next step is to play Capes, carry, and With Great Power ..., through many reward cycles and with different groups, in order to see whether they represent a counter-example that explodes my whole claim, or whether they represent specific customizations of what I'm talking about. Dunno yet.<br/>

                            Hey Jamey,<br/>
<br/>
Clarification: I'm annoyed at Guy, not you. Just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I added in the IIEE stuff onto the diagram itself, which wasn't in what I drew in GenCon. Let's consider PTA in terms of IIEE, and maybe I can answer your question right here (although I reeeeeally wish we were talking about an actual-play moment, I know this is a bad idea without it, I know it!).<br/>
<br/>
In solid, functional PTA play, before rolling, <i>all</i> that's there is current Intent. No Initiation at all; that'll be brought into the SIS later, by the narrator, long after all the cards are face-up on the table. So in this game alone, John Harper's summary makes a lot of sense, because pre-narrating outcomes as he did means that Initiation is implicit in those outcomes. Pre-narrating them adds confusion because, now, post-Intent but pre-cards, we <i>do not know</i> whether we're messing with (adding to) Initiation or not, when we provide those pre-narrations. It is very likely that we are, even if the final outcomes are respectively kept provisional, awaiting the cards.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore the eventual narrator is going to be working with a very, very dicey set of parameters, because where does his narration begin? As the <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20892.0" rel="nofollow">Actual play actual examples?</a></b> thread shows, and I've seen this same thing arise many times in other groups, the group is now stuck, and the only solution is to figure that <i>all of IIEE</i> somehow occurred when no one was looking, and all the narrator can do is repeat it, and maybe add a sound-effect or two.<br/>
<br/>
(Troy, I'm hoping these points help with your question too.)<br/>
<br/>
How's that? I suppose more questions are welcome, after all. Not any "just" ones though. "Just" questions can suck my wang.<br/>

                            The difference I see between these two statements:
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">"Okay, I want to try and fight the vampires, to show Buffy that I'm not a coward."</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">"If I win, Xander shows Buffy that he's not a coward."</div>
</blockquote>
Is that in the first case Xander's player is stating what their character is attempting to do, while in the second they're saying what the result will be if they're succesful at a dice roll.<br/>
<br/>
But what if Buffy isn't impressed regardless of whether Xander fights the Vampire?  What if Buffy is distracted, possessed, or there's something unknown to Xander about the vampire that makes Xander's attempt to impress Buffy fail?  Maybe it's a kid in a halloween mask and Buffy thinks Xander knows that, and Xander ends up punching him out -- or maybe it's a good vampire they need to get to help them -- either way, she's not going to be impressed with Xander.<br/>
<br/>
In the first example, there is the more potential for twists in the story, suprises for the Xander player, and more room for other players to contribute to the story.                        </div>

                            I've been saying this about Hero Quest for a while now. Partly my fault, people keep suggesting that it's all about stakes. I've suggested using explicit stake setting at times to get people out of the mindset of task resolution and tactical play. Like suggesting that you allow the player to decide the negative outcome before hand if he wants (to teach player trust in failure results). <br><br>Somebody used a good phrase recently about this, however, it's like Training Wheels. Explicit stake setting is good for getting players to understand certain things at times. <br><br>But, like all training wheels, you want to take them off later, once trust is established, and things are working out smoothly. As I've said many times, one great joy of being a HQ Narrator is holding the (very traditional) right to narrate the outcome of contests such that you can use the outcomes to create new conflict, highlight character features, or any such stuff. <br><br>It's not really avant guard or anything, but HQ does have very simple Conflict Resolution as you chart mentions.

                            Hi Dave,<br/>
<br/>
You are right on target, although the term is <i>narrational</i> authority, not narrative, and that's really important distinction, not nit-picking. As it happens, in my GenCon notepad I was using that evening, someone asked some questions that meant I flipped the page over and wrote out the four levels of authority in order to answer them. I just saw them when I found the diagram last night, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thread you requested: <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.0" rel="nofollow">Silent railroading and the intersection of scenario prep and player authorship</a></b>, concerning a game of The Mountain Witch.<br/>
<br/>
It intersects with this thread topic totally, because the kind of screwed-up variant that I'm talking about, by definition interferes with the established authorities all 'cross the map, both up and down the levels I listed, and also throughout the extension of the rest of the resolution procedure. When authority-organization goes, everything goes. It really is like tossing sand into the gears, or gluing the steeple on the turtle, or putting a live, vexed chicken in your pants.<br/>

I'm suggesting a reasonable dramatic situation which could occur in a game.  If the system supports that kind of situation, it's a good thing.  Otherwise... not so much.<br/>
<br/>
If the game doesn't place any limits on the narrative reward a player can give themself for a conflict, either before or after they roll, you could end up with:<br/>
<br/>
"I fight the Vampire!" Roll "I win, Xander and Buffy get married!"<br/>
"If I win, Xander and Buffy get married!"<br/>
<br/>
unless the goal of the game is clearly defined as "make a good, reasonable story" or the players have somehow agreed not to get too wacky, and thus agree not too push too far (even if the rules would allow it).

The "fight the vampires" task is a way to situate Xander in the conflict-of-interest, in which the intent is to show bravery in front of Buffy. And you know what? That's actually a much better way to say it, now that I think about it. "Xander fights the vampires, and <i>tries to act brave</i> in front of Buffy." Same conflict, but now the intent is phrased in a way that doesn't pre-narrate the consequences at all. Will Buffy be impressed by this show of bravery? Will she ridicule Xander if he fails and acts cowardly? That's in the realm of post-resolution narrational authority, in PTA.                        </br></br></br></div>

That'd definitely be actual-play stuff. There's a lot of ways to slice up that diagram, per game system, and a lot of ways people adjust the authority levels within a group. So there are lots more insights to find, but at this point, I think we'll find them only by going "situational."<br/>

I just noticed the PDF turned into two pages when I wasn't looking. Damn. Will fix.<br/>

                            I got a lot out of John Harper's 100-to-0-to-85 post, and Matt's PTA Issue post.  They helped me to make sense of certain aspects of this as regards my SNAP design, as well as being generally informative.  So thanks, guys - John, Matt, and everyone.<br>
<br>
Question for Ron - I really liked the way that John Harper post used "goal" to describe the Intent-like stage (of course I would, since SNAP calls that conflict-setting step choosing goals).  You seem to avoid that word - am I reading that right?  If so, is there a reason?  I'm looking at revising my vocabulary about this issue in general (and in the text of SNAP), is why I'm asking.<br>
<br>
And time for me to categorize the various steps of SNAP resolution in terms of Ron's diagram - I think I like the way it fits, but maybe there's ANOTHER hole I'm missing,<br>

<br/>
I'm not avoiding "goal." It's a fine word, makes sense as used, and fits right in. I used to use it all the time as my group wrestled its way through learning how to think this way, when we were playing Hero Wars, 2001-2002.<br/>

                            All that said, it seems to me that the appeal of stakes-before-execution, perhaps in an unthinking "ooh, shiny!" way is actually a reaction to the old-school "chesting" phenomenon.  It's a way of guaranteeing that my intention will be respected if I win the roll of the dice.  <br><br>As a for instance, if Xander is beating up vampires with the intent that he demonstrate to Buffy that he's brave, and Buffy is blind to demonstrations of bravery, it's really weak to find that out after we've committed to conflict resolution.

This is why they should clearly state before the conflict the intentions (or goals if you prefer that term) of the characters <i>for that conflict</i>.<br><br>But setting the stakes in a free-form way let you state much more than your intentions or goals in the conflict. They let you state other things that will happen, the actions used to solve the conflict, small related events, hooks for follow-up conflicts (or even to introduce new conflicts directly), other details not so much related with the conflict at hand, and any kind of possible consequences of it.<br><br>And this is why they are dangerous. If someone missuse them to say too much (anything more than the goals), other players may instinctively react to this over-empowering, trying to introduce their own stuff when setting 'their stakes' with the delusion that it will prevent the story to derive out of their control. <br>And setting stakes may be fun on itself, it may even become a non-ruled part of the game where the players contend to mingle (and risk) their fictional stuff into the conflict.<br><br>Thus, the subvert fight begins every time a conflict is declared. And everytime it is a somehow frustating feeling, because one of the contenders will find his efforts and investment neglected when the mechanics are applied and the conflict is solved.<br><br>This is how it worked for me in a couple of situation. Perhaps it happened to you sometimes, perhaps never. But I can see it is an open door for the problem.<br><br>I can see two possible solutions:<br>Solution 1: State your intentions (goals) for the conflict at hand;  do not let players request any other fictional content than their goals before the conflict is solved.<br><br>Solution 2: Articulate a ruled negotiation for setting stakes, and make it the main conflict resolution mechanism (like Polaris?)<br><br>(Edit:) I'm regreting now to have written so much without providing my Actual Play examples.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thanks for all the help so far, Ron, but I have one more question with what you have called orthogonal and oppositional conflicts of interest. I'm getting myself confused here, but how is an orthogonal conflict of interest possible? Your examples at the start of the thread:<br><br>* He's grabbing the vase; she's stopping him from doing so (oppositional)<br>* He's grabbing the vase; she's shooting him (orthogonal)<br>* He's stabbing her; she's stabbing him (orthogonal)<br><br>The oppositional ones make sense; I can see a clear and obvious conflict of interest there. The orthogonal ones do not, unless they could be fairly restated as two different oppositional ones (which would be the case for all orthogonal conflicts as far as I can see). Is this true? Are orthogonal conflicts just a combination of two or more oppositional ones, with implict counter-intents ("Don't get shot")?<br><br>Some real Actual Play: Me, Tom, Steve &amp; Rich - friends who I have been gaming with for several months now. Mostly oWoD stuff, but they enjoyed Dogs, and the Mountain Witch and other "indie fare" when I have run it for them. Tom, the GM for 90% of the WoD stuff bought the PDFs of DitV and kpfs, and decided to run a quick one-shot of kpfs, which worked out to be disturbingly fun. But there was a problem with one conflict in particular, and afterward we went back to the original GM-fiat-y rules rather than the annotated 'Sorcerer-derived' rules we got confused by.<br><br>The situation was that Rich wanted to climb into the back window of a pet store without alerting the security guard who had been posted there. I was helping him by keeping watch on the guard, but Steve had his character try to throw a knife at Rich's back in revenge for an earlier betrayal. I then changed my action to try and stop Steve's attack.<br><br>So we had: Rich vs. Guard, Steve vs. Rich &amp; Me vs. Steve. (It looks clearer written down than it felt at the time). That is three separate oppositional conflicts, I think. But it could have been some kind of messy orthogonal conflict, as that is how what we inferred from a read of the kpfs annotated rules.

                            Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you guys too, for the curiosity and the willingness to stick it through answers when they don't work out right away.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">* He's grabbing the vase; she's stopping him from doing so (oppositional)<br/>

<br/>
You said,
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">The oppositional ones make sense; I can see a clear and obvious conflict of interest there. The orthogonal ones do not, unless they could be fairly restated as two different oppositional ones (which would be the case for all orthogonal conflicts as far as I can see). Is this true? Are orthogonal conflicts just a combination of two or more oppositional ones, with implict counter-intents ("Don't get shot")?</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
There. That last one. The counter-intents are implicit. Otherwise, you're just looking at two different tasks which may not even be conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
However, it's more than just two oppositional tasks being run at once. In the hypothetical example, she clearly doesn't just want to stop him from getting the vase, she has chosen to <i>shoot him</i> regardless of whether he succeeds. He is so into getting that vase that he's willing to risk getting shot. Based on whatever's been happening in the scenario, there's a lot of judgment, a lot of passion, and a lot of history going on. It also - and this is key - raises the question of who pre-empts whom. Notice, I said <i>the question</i> of that latter point. That's actually part of the conflict itself.<br/>
<br/>
That's why actual play is necessary for context, so we can tell why it's such a big deal if he gets the vase, or why she's not just standing in front of him and saying "no" as in the oppositional case. Orthogonal conflicts tend to arise extremely organically, such that the people involved, and usually the whole group, are totally invested in every character's priority - why he is not simply dodging to avoid being shot, for example. The "free and clear" phase in Sorcerer, prior to a group roll, is about absolutely <i>nothing but</i> establishing which conflicts are truly under consideration, and whether they're oppositional or orthogonal. That's what the dice diagrams in Sex &amp; Sorcery are all about too.<br/>

You just got my attention big-time, but I'm not surprised. Such rules are going to throw task-based White Wolf players totally for a loop, especially since they probably arrived at in-house GM-fiat methods just to get through conflicts a long time previously anyway. You guys were facing a live-vexed-chicken moment, and I was right, wasn't I? You were baffled and concerned about the integrity of the SIS.<br/>

Brace yourself, I'm gonna be a little hard on you here.<br/>

<br/>
Ohhhh, this is so easy. If you think it's easier written out, try <i>drawing</i> it, with each name and little arrows. In fact, I just did it and it's not complicated at all.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, instead of saying "it could have been some kind of messy orthogonal conflict," turn that whole attitude around, and say, "Yay! Messy orthogonal conflict! Fuckin' A!"<br/>
<br/>
See how important previous history is to these conflicts? This was it! This was the payback moment for the earlier betrayal! This was also your character's statement of loyalty to Rich's! All <i>kinds</i> of rockin' stuff was on the line, and as I see it, that's what a Fortune mechanic is b[]totally for[/b], especially when situated <b>in the middle</b> of the narrative elements of (a) conflicts of interest and (b) ultimate impacts on the SIS.<br/>
<br/>
Because it's precisely those conflicts which are most fun in stories. Yet somehow traditional role-playing rules drain all the juice out of them, whether by making them impossible (traditional non-rolled initiative based on scores) or by trying to layer compensatory mechanics over traditional ones (roll for initiative, then go in reverse order; etc).<br/>
<br/>
And you guys totally muffed it. Talk about role-playing training sliding a poker directly up the ass of what could have been a beautiful thing. Yeah, sure, you <i>survived</i> it, the group got <i>through</i> it, and so on. Great. You got through it. Tom had to do it all himself and <i>make up</i> who had the drop on whom first, and all that consequential stuff. I'm sure it's an old skill he developed long ago. Mark my words: it's an exhausting, boring skill, whose <i>only</i> virtue is that it's not laboring through a bunch of wargamey hex-map + initiative-roll bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
The hump to get over, at least for the role-player steeped in previous methods, is to realize that it's like grabbing a live wire. You may not get what you want. At least in the crunchy-statty-hexy way, you'll get the chance to get what you want when your turn comes. At least in the fiat way, the GM will take care of you. This way, though ... it's all in the mix. The dice are gonna play their part, and so will the subsequent choices. Look out.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to use my kpfs rules to work this out right here, assigning some scores and rolling some dice, but I can't find them and am strapped for time all of a sudden. So, I suggest you do it. Let's say Steve's character has a Mean of 3, your character has a Fucked-Up of 3, and Rich's character has a Cold of 3, which I'm more-or-less casually assigning as the relevant scores (may not have been in your real game, but OK).<br/>
<br/>
Grab the dice! Grab the rules! Draw the little diagram! Tell us what happens when you follow the rules.<br/>

Well, no one's discussed playing kpfs for ages, and this was with a new GM who was totally invested in World of Darkness stuff, and hence the true target audience. Well, hey - consider that a request for an Actual Play post, not about orthogonal/oppositional (unless my above explanation is inadequate), but about that GM and his background and how that played into the game.<br/>

                            One last point: Arturo's suggestions are exactly what I've been saying all along. See Trollbabe! It's all about making sure that the trollbabe's goals are <u>always</u> fully stated prior to hitting the dice, and it flips around the traditional approach by letting anyone say "conflict!" and that triggers the need to get her goals articulated.<br/>
<br/>
Trollbabe was the first game to do this explicitly. I learned it from playing Dust Devils and Hero Wars, and was surprised to discover that my own earlier game, Sorcerer, had already provided its own solution when I wasn't looking (I knew it worked, but not why). I used the term <i>goals</i>, which is why Gordon's perception that I was avoiding that term is kind of strange. I suggest getting back to that usage, which carries a lot less room for problems.<br/>
<br/>
It's hard enough to be coming from a task-resolution mentality into a conflict-resolution procedure. Putting in this "stakes" thing, as it has evolved through uncritical uses, makes it harder, not easier.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot state this strongly enough: all this talk of "stakes," whether Judd's enthusiasm when he was just figuring it out, or Mike's and John's training wheels attempts, or as a synonym for goals as I called them in Trollbabe, or whatever ... has gone down a wrong road. Great intentions, and I'm not saying otherwise. But look at what's become of it.<br/>
<br/>
It screwed up all the examples in Mortal Coil. It turns Stranger Things into a storyboarding exercise rather than an actual developing story. It makes Primetime Adventures, one of the purest and best RPGs around, unplayable to a certain percent of readers (again through some examples, mainly). I could go on, with Cold City, The Shab al-Hiri Roach, and more. Do you see what I mean? The problem is not merely among a certain sector of readership! It affects the writing and presentation of the game, as the <i>author himself</i> is dragged into a weird mental space and starts writing as if the game were a storyboard outcome-organizer instead of a conflict resolution system.<br/>
<br/>
It is a disaster and we need to recognize it. Sure, the author knows how to play it well, but he is instructing others to do something else entirely, and that creates the age-old bogosity, "well, you just need to play it with the author." Which is <i>total</i> bogosity. That is code for "confusing, unworkable game."<br/>
<br/>
If it helps to hear it from Arturo rather than me, then so be it. What he said, because it's what I've been saying for years.<br/>
Everyone who's been saying "but there's something good there," and all that, is missing the fact that they are agreeing with me. What they're seeing that's good is <i>getting the goals out in front of everyone</i>.<br/>
<br/>
But that's not what "stakes" have become.<br/>

Cool, thanks Ron. I can't remember the exact scores anymore (this game was in May, and our gaming has been significantly reduced since then due work issues until next month), but I'll go through the rules assuming appropriate scores of 3. <br><br>Via the magic of an dice rolling applet &amp; the kpfs PDF (aren't smartphones great) step by step we have this:<br><br><b>first</b> (declare goals; free &amp; clear stage)<br>Tom - I don't want anybody to get into this store. The guy guarding the place is keeping is eyes open. He's a heroic guy using his Astute of 3. He's going to looking at <i>all</i> of you.<br>Rich - I want to get into the pet store without being spotted. I'm going to climb in via the back window. Rolling Fucked up &amp; I'm going to stare at Tom.<br>Me - I want to help Rich get into the store without raising attention. I'm going to keep an eye on the security guard. Rolling Cold and staring at Tom.<br>Steve - Hah! I'm going to get back at Rich! I'm going to throw my knife at his back as he climbs in! Rolling Mean and laughing at Rich.<br>Me - Fuck that! I'm going to try and stop you by tackling you to the ground instead. Also rolling Mean &amp; I'm staring at Steve.<br><br><b>second</b> (roll dice; I'll assume no hate or anything for clarity)<br>Tom - 6 (Total of 9; success)<br>Rich - 2 (Total of 5; fail) <br>Steve - 4 (Total of 7; success)<br>Me - 5 (Total of 8; success)<br><br><b>third</b> (execution)<br>Tom rolled highest, but he's the GM so doesn't get a go.<br><br>I go first; I'm a winner and I'm looking at Steve, who is also a winner. Tom is looking at all of us, and he's a winner as well. I opt not to screw the guard out of his goal and continue onto Steve. Now I can give up my goal (stop Steve) to screw Steve out of his. This is where I get confused -- isn't that just a win-win situation? What would happen if I chose not to stop Steve here? I would win my goal of stopping Steve, but mechanically, I wouldn't have done so? I screw Steve and become a loser.<br><br>Steve has lost his turn; I've screwed him out of it. We agree that I tackle him to the ground before he gets to throw his knife.<br><br>Rich has failed, and he and Tom are looking at each other. The rules say "you can't be a loser and they're a winner." Have I done something wrong here? Let's say that this changes nothing.<br><br><b>forth</b> (wrap up)<br>At the end of all that, everyone but Tom is a loser (even though my goal was 'Stop Steve' and I successfully stopped Steve?). So Rich fails to get into the store and the security guard hears all the fuss and comes running out to see Rich struggling with the window and me &amp; Steve rolling around on the ground in the backalley.<br><br>Which is a good state for things to be in, but there were a couple of strange things in there. The rules we used in the end (roll d6+stat vs. the opposition's score or 7+ if unresisted. Narration is then thrashed out by all with the GM having the final say) would have produced a very similar outcome: I beat Steve, so he doesn't hit Rich. Rich fails to get in, and the Security guard is aware of all three of us. Now I don't know if that's something to do with the kpfs rules or something more fundamental that we are missing. And I do like the kpfs system, but it does feel at times like "mass orgy conflict rules."<br><br>I'll get on a broader AP report for the Forge too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi there,<br/>
I'm reading it differently, but that's because I don't have the rules in front of me. I'll use Sorcerer logic, which is what Vincent thought he was doing when he wrote this patch-rule. If he came up with something different from what I'm about to say (because it's been a long while since I read'em, and I played the game before he wrote'em), then all that follows is not considered a correction of what you said, but a <i>de novo</i> application of Sorcerer thinking.<br/>
<br/>
The GM's high roll means the guard spotted all you little perverts first. That means that every single person now has to weigh the choice between getting what he initially wanted and getting busted. (This guard is heroic, man; if you don't get outta there, he's gonna get you and attack your scurfy ass.)<br/>
<br/>
You go next. You're a winner. You can keep your action and stop Steve. If you do that, you can't stop the guard seeing you, he beat you and went first. But you can still shift to dealing with that instead of Steve, altogether. So do you stop Steve, as planned, which also means that the guard will catch you, or do you scrap the attempt to stop Steve and just run off? (I'll make up this rule - "success" on your roll gives you this option. That works, actually.)<br/>
<br/>
OK, so now Steve goes next. If you stopped him, you stopped him. Too bad for Steve's announced action, but that's what you going first means. However, he still has the chance not even to throw his knife (seeing you in the way or whatever) and to run off, avoiding the guard.<br/>
<br/>
See, this was orthogonal, big-time. Arguably, if Steve had gone first, he could have nailed Rich with the knife <i>and</i> run off safely, in which case, you would be advised to abort your "stop Steve," because it was worthless, and run off too.<br/>
<br/>
Rich is so lame it's not even funny. While you and Steve were doing your little waltz-of-decisions and as the guard shone his flashlight on the pack of you, he just fiddles unsuccessfully with the window or falls off the ladder or some other application of Fucked-uppedness. He's totally caught.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'll be the first to say that kpfs lacks defensive rolls and so the whole "abort" option in Sorcerer doesn't 'port to it well. So Sorcerer-thinking doesn't apply as cleanly to it as it does to, say, Dust Devils.<br/>
<br/>
So it can turn out any of these ways, and in no other:<br/>
<br/>
1. The guard catches all three of you, because you and Steve are tussling and Rich is up there being an oblivious dork, but with no knife in his back.<br/>
<br/>
2. The guard catches only Rich, with no knife in his back, because both you and Steve scampered off, aborting both your stated actions in order to do so.<br/>
<br/>
3. The guard catches Rich with a knife in his back and Steve as well, because you ran off, leaving Steve to complete his action and get caught.<br/>
<br/>
4. The guard catches Rich, with no knife in his back, and you as well, because you stayed to stop Steve and he aborted his knife-throw and ran off.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I am suspicious that Vincent's version is broken or weird in some way, mainly because he made it up in about two minutes based on an actual-play post of mine. But if you use my logic above - in which order of action = pre-emption, and in which a successful roll gives you the option to abort the action (in order to deal with something that came in quicker) - then it works out pretty well.                        </div>

                            I will be happy to apply the same logic to any combination of rolls and successes that you would like to provide. In fact, I'll do it now! Let's reverse the numbers totally.<br/>
<br/>
You - 6 (Total of 9; success)<br/>
Steve - 2 (Total of 5; fail)<br/>
Rich - 4 (Total of 7; success)<br/>
Tom - 5 (Total of 8; success)<br/>
<br/>
All right, you got the highest, so you go first. Wham - Steve ain't getting that knife thrown, no matter what. Never mind the fact that he failed his roll; we're not there yet, and your character doesn't know that yet - you wanted to be in position to stop the knife, and you are. Done.<br/>
<br/>
Tom's next with the guard: "Halt, you little perverts!" You already went and were successful, so you can "beat the guard" right now and run off, no problem. (Notice that this system doesn't permit the full range of effects; in Sorcerer, you could have gone first <i>and</i> failed, but having gone first, can now roll defense against the guard.) Unless you're an idiot and want to announce some other thing like attacking the guard, which will have to wait until the next round anyway. The other two are now in jeopardy from the guard.<br/>
<br/>
Rich is next - he can get through the window, but will get caught by the guard, who's looking right at him for Chrissake, or he can abort the whole thing and run off, because he was successful.<br/>
<br/>
And poor Steve is fucked ... not only does he throw his knife through his own foot or some other classically-appropriate kpfs narration of failure, he is totally busted by the guard.<br/>
<br/>
And again!!<br/>
<br/>
Steve - 6 (Total of 9; success)<br/>
You - 2 (Total of 5; fail)<br/>
Tom - 4 (Total of 7; success)<br/>
Rich - 5 (Total of 8; success)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this one's fun. Steve's got a clear shot at Rich, and thwock! The knife lands solidly.<br/>
<br/>
Rich is next, and he's inside the store, no problem, but the trouble is he has a knife in his back.<br/>
<br/>
Tom's next, and now the guard shows up. He can't see Rich (who succeeded and went earlier), and Steve can choose to run off before getting caught; let's assume he does because anything else makes little sense.<br/>
<br/>
And you, poor soul, not only tripped over your own shoelaces when trying to stop Steve, but now blink stupidly in the glare of the guard's flashlight.<br/>
<br/>
Want me to keep going? Even with a system that's not ideal for it (i.e. obviates some possibilities, in this case), the logic is sound.<br/>

Word up. And this is totally <i>not</i> what I wanted to happen in Mortal Coil, yet it is clearly an issue with the way I wrote the rules (see the trouble Clinton, Jason, and Remi had with it for example). I said "stakes" and I definitely meant "goals".                        </div>

I would simultaneously assert that my earlier post was in the "there's something good here" vein, and that I wasn't missing that I might be agreeing with you.  (And I incidentally resent the indirect insinuation otherwise.)  I do think that the visibility of goals is a definite good.  But I also think that those goals have to be respected in the course of resolution, or you haven't advanced past "and the three guards after him ambush you."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
Yes. Absolutely. That is a given feature of the diagram and fundamental to the idea of "conflict resolution," because step 1 defines the conflict of interests = stated goals = commitment to achieving them. I don't see any need to raise that issue as a qualifier or a risk.<br/>

<br/>
I can only point to my post above which says, "leave out this stakes-setting business entirely. Keep the 'goals,' keep the 'intent' or 'commitment to do X' or any other way to phrase it which focuses on the conflict of interest. Abandon 'stakes' talk entirely. It is a bottle of rat poison."<br/>
<br/>
Your "further" point belongs in a different place on the diagram: the ultimate impact on the SIS, including whatever parts of the middle step are involved in determining it, if any. Plenty of games permit extravagant impact on the game-world, even if the stated conflict of interest is quite small. Universalis is built specifically on making this possible, for example. So that's accounted for as well, and no part of step 1 is needed to be altered to permit it.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to have to decide whether you think I'm attacking you, and therefore whether you think you need to defend yourself. As far as I can tell, we are agreeing. If you see that as a basis for setting up some sort of hostile, defensive exchange, then I dunno what to say and will opt out.<br/>

Didn't read any attack, didn't see the basis of a hostile exchange.  Just had a point of view.<br><br>I do think we are agreeing, just with a different emphasis.  Crucially, I think the big point was that narrating results before we resolve is a misfeature, at best.  And the emphasis I heard from your commentary was that that's been called stakes setting, which as terminology is bad.  And the emphasis I've been pushing that narrated results is an over-reaction to not having your goals respected.  It seems like you agree with what I found important, and I'll certainly grant that the phrase "stakes setting" has been poisoned with a bad meaning.                        </br></br></div>

                            I've been following this thread with great interest, and it's been very helpful. So now I'll delurk for a comment/question.<br><br>In terms of setting "reasonable" goals, going back to the Buffy example, what do you think about goals being limited to "what you can do in a short amount of time with what you have access to?" For example, Xander could impress Buffy by fighting vampires (assuming there wasn't some reason Buffy <em>couldn't</em> be impressed at that point): fighting is short, vampires are at hand. Whereas it seems like a goal of "I burn down the whole town" in DitV seems a bit outside that scope. I think some discussion about what "reasonable" or "acceptable" goals are would be good. Sure, they're contextual, but something more to go on would be very useful.                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthew Gandy</cite>In terms of setting "reasonable" goals, going back to the Buffy example, what do you think about goals being limited to "what you can do in a short amount of time with what you have access to?"</blockquote>
Whether or not your question is completely germane to this discussion, I think that limit is reasonable for some games.  Specifically, I think it's part of the responsibility of a game to describe what limits on goals are reasonable.  And I think usually, that limit is implicit to the system.<br><br>As an example, it's not unusual for a system to grant that character goals will often be "I kill him."  But the limit placed on the goal is that you'll hurt him as much as you can - and since that limit is implicit in the rules, and understood by the players, when the result of the conflict is that he's got a sucking chest wound but isn't dead, everyone's happy.<br><br>More to the point, the scope of a goal ought to relate to the conflict it relates to.  If you've come to a place in Dogs where you've got a conflict that spans a day, and is over what happens to the whole town, "I burn it down" seems like a fine goal.  "I dowse the meeting hall with lamp oil and light it on fire" would be a fine raise.  But if we're talking about getting the Steward to admit that he's culpable (because, face it, isn't he always?), burning down the town doesn't relate to the conflict.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Matthew,<br/>
<br/>
I went and washed my dog. Now I feel better.<br/>
<br/>
The answer depends on the specific game, and it's incumbent on that its rules-set to provide an answer. But typically they don't, or at least not as clearly as they provide rules for how-to-hit and how-hard. In task-resolution systems, certain actions tend to be highly, even obsessively detailed in their exact physical effects, and all other actions' scope and extent are impossibly vague.<br/>
<br/>
Very few games have explicit rules about the scope and extent of announced actions outside of that topic. Conflict-resolution games really, really need it, but I think that too is a developing technology.<br/>
<br/>
Trollbabe includes a fixed maximum for how much an action may "change the world," per adventure, which also happens to match up with the prepped consequences of the adventure for the immediate setting, and also with the scope/size of relationships the characters may create during that adventure. The point-system in HeroQuest extended contests included an "effect" scale based on how many points had been bid, although I have only used it in its Hero Wars incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
In most other games, one has to work off of examples and inferences from the rest of the text, in two basic ways. Surprisingly, the way which seems most obvious - the actual examples - is usually the least reliable or satisfying. Why? Because they're typically written at the last minute, typically second-guessed halfway through (producing ambiguities and inconsistencies), and bizarrely misleading in terms of who is actually doing what, in play (using character names when talking about rolling dice, for example).<br/>
<br/>
The other way works off the presentation of the setting and any (rare) presentations of situations in which characters take action, not as rules-examples, but of the "this is how play looks" variety. The very best example, because it has a unique advantage is Primetime Adventures. Why? Because it's TV. If you're doing a Buffyesque series, then everyone knows what sort of actions are "units" of expression per character, per scene, in that kind of show. In fact, TV shows are remarkably internally consistent in this variable. Say, in a given lawyer-type drama, everyone knows how much information can be imparted for how much "plot oomph," per scene, and that's typically the same across every episode.<br/>
<br/>
Primitive offers a slightly vaguer, but actually pretty powerful hint as well, in the same way, only thematic. In that game, all of the mechanics are founded on the idea that the individual is smaller and less effective than the tribe, in every way. So a stated action, for an individual, can't be a "tribe-level" thing; it <i>must</i> be smaller. The game doesn't out-and-out state that, but the principle is applied in so many concrete ways that it's not hard to extrapolate it to this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs is a little vague, but at least one is given latitude in defining the basic conflict, and all components within it are usually assumed to be smaller or at least no bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Even these kind-of-iffy guidelines are more clear than what most RPGs provide, which is to say, nothing. The typical game published from the mid-1980s through the late-1990s follows standard which I'm pretty sure is derived from Call of Cthulhu and a kind of no-hex-Champions application, both of which were derived from the wargame combat model: one guy, one weapon, a few seconds, go! The rules and books never say a word about it; people are verbally taught to "play right" in this regard, as a socially-transmitted feature and assumption of role-playing as an activity. This state of affairs is lamentable and illustrates yet another way in which "role-playing" is a legacy rather than a definition, and a subculture rather than an activity.<br/>
<br/>
I've found that in some games, I can use the rules for detailed actions as analogies for guides for the vague ones. I tend to use the personal scale, high-impact rules of fighting in The Riddle of Steel as the model for what the socially-influential skills can do ... so one can "kill" a person (in the sense of shutting them down, psychologically or socially, at least for the scene) with a solid "hit" using a social skill, using the fighting rules as the template. But as one cannot kill a city's population with a sword-thrust in this game, neither can one convince a whole city with such a roll. There's no rule about this in the book; it's just a technique I've fallen back on for a number of games, but found surprisingly useful and also amenable as far as the other players are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
So! My hope is that the next wave of RPG design over the next year, and perhaps revisions of some current games, we'll see this particular technology blossom. It's long overdue, and Trollbabe is lonely.<br/>

                            Well, some of this goes back to the original problem of pre-narrated stakes. Consider "If I win, then your mother falls in love with [the vampire]!" Replace "If I win, then" with "My goal is." Is this possible? Is this a reasonable goal? Is it bigger than the scope of one conflict, which was part of what I was getting at?                        </div>

                            Hey Matthew, check out my diagram. All of this is a feature of a given system in terms of the ultimate impact on the SIS (the last step). What I'm saying is that the scope of that extent should be a feature of a conflict resolution system, and if it's not, then a piece is missing.<br/>
<br/>
So in some games, yes, it would be OK for a conflict concerning a dispute over pocket change in an alley ultimately to result in the nuclear destruction of the city. This sort of thing happens in Universalis all the time; it's inherent to the system as a possibility, and the possibility is often tempting.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas in others, no, such a thing is not OK at all, because the character's effects on the world are contained in that conflict, and the conflict is contained in the scene, which has limits (like a movie-screen's borders, or the imagined "space" implied by them, which is still finite).<br/>
<br/>
The game has to tell you this. There is no answer for how it "should" be, for any and all conflict resolution. This is a customized feature which every rules-set needs to be explicit about.<br/>
<br/>

Just for clarity - Goal is such a good word (IMO), that I'm just shocked that people don't leap all over it in orgasmic glee.  It was obviously a mistake on my part to interpret the lack of that as OPPOSITION to the word . . .                        </br></br></div>
