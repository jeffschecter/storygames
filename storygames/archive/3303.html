It aims to experiment with and demonstrate to others the working of this particular chunkk of theory. Ideally, the act of reading and playing the game teaches, demonstrates and critiques the chosen aspect of theory, all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso ideally, TheoryGames are small (both in page count, wordcount, and in terms of time to play and other social footprint costs), and free in the monetary sense (like the theory is, mostly).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Why TheoryGames?</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>To demonstrate</i> Confused on what IIEE is? Game X shows it in action!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>To explore</i> - Perhaps there's an aspect of theory that you think doesn't get much use, or might produce soemthign interesting if explictly applied. Find out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>To critique</i> - By using the theory we discover its limitations and flaws.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i> As a challenge</i> - Not sure how a particular bit of theory is useful Just looking for some structure for you next project? Make a TheoryGame!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>As an answer</i> - "so what use is this theory, anyway?" Well, it directly influenced these games in a way which is really obvious!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Possible Ideas</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMake a game that:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Demonstrates explicitly in game the difference between Intent, Initiation, Execution and Effect.<br/>\n* Demonstrates the difference between conflict resolution and task resolution<br/>\n* Demonstrates the four types of Authority (as Ron talked about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.msg216100#msg216100" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and ways in which they might be divided up.<br/>\n* Demonstrates exactly why the Czege Principle is right (or ISN'T right, for the daring).<br/>\n* Demonstrates why deprotagonisation is always rubbish (or might not be, for the VERY daring! Try making a game in which the players are deliberately deprotagonised!)<br/>\n* Demonstrates the differences between the five Elements of Exploration (Setting, Character, Situation, System, Color). Maybe each player can only provide one of each? Go nuts!<br/>\n* Demonstrates the differences between Karma/Drama/Fortune resolution methoids, and their effect on game play. (perhaps the game uses Karma for some things, Fortune for others, and Drama for yet a third set of circumstances, and the game would show how the three circumstances were thus made dramtically different).<br/>\n* Demonstrates the differences between at-the-Begininng/in-the-Middle/at-the-End types of resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Guidelines</b><br/>\n<br/>\n* Try and make the link between the theory and your game as explicit as possible without obfuscating the game itself. Remember one of the aims is to demonstrate something in action. Perhaps marginal notes would be good for this, like in The Mountain Witch!<br/>\n<br/>\n* Try and mix the theory into the game in a cool way, with symbolic/thematic elements mixing between the two. Your game's whole world can be a metaphor for theory, or you can reinforce the theory-elements with suitably symbolic analogues.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Don't spend too much time on it! Keep it fun, simple, and frothy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74893/#Comment_74893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-11T08:21:08+00:00" title="June 11, 2007  8:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really neat idea/challenge.  And in a sort of zeitgheist way it gels with some thinking I had been toying with over the weekend.  I had been considering that the various elements I like (or want to like) about comic book/super hero gaming did not necessarially work together mechanically.  <br><br>For instance, from time to time I like really crunchy superheroic battles (Champions maybe?) but I also like the almost soap operatic back stories (With Great Power maybe?).  I've yet to see a system handle both well.  And I've a thing for legacy heroes (see the current JSA comics) and alternate realities (Elseworlds, What If?), but have yet to see a system that can provide mechanical linkages for such things.  <br><br>So what?  So I was thinking, "Self, instead of one game to do them all, why not FOUR games that can interact but that each do ONE thing really well."  Four being a fairly arbitrary number.  Now I see this contest.  So now I have to see if I can find some theory linkages that parrallel this design intention.<br><br>Don't know if it will happen, but I did what to get that off my chest and say again, "Great Idea for a Challenge!"<br><br>Blue                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
