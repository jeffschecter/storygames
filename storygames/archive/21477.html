Plus, reading the rules for twice as many. That's how you become knowledgeable about RPGs, right?<br/><br/>Borrowing, although borrowing <i>per se</i> isn't the aim. If you borrow from half a dozen games, that's perhaps derivative design... When you borrow from a hundred games, that's just knowing your craft.<br/><br/>Soaking in a lot of discussion from the Forge, Knutepunkt and other places (virtual or otherwise), reading books and essays (including some fairly theoretical stuff)... that did help broaden my horizons too, mostly by pointing me at a greater variety of games than I would otherwise have known had I just remained within my basement (actually, attic) playing whatever shade of D&amp;D with the local guys.<br/><br/>Oh, and <b>purpose</b>. Immediate purpose. I've found I'm generally successful (depending of course on how we measure success) when I know what I'm designing a game <i>for</i>. To play with <i>these</i> people, to run it at <i>that</i> convention, to have it published on a certain magazine, to put the contents of an old game box to some use, to carry something in my bag I can give out as a business card or portfolio of sorts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469944/#Comment_469944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T13:10:12+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  1:10PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really wide question.<br/><br/>Taking a stab at an answer, I'll say that my secret super power in this regard is what I like to call a "structural vision" - this is, I understand, a common feature in other fields of design as well, not just game design. A good designer has to be able to not only look at a finished thing and perceive its structure, but to also be able to visualize a structure in their head. To design is to manipulate structures with intent; there are other types of creation that do not work like this, but "designing" is specifically this. I've become pretty good in this one facet of game design, so it's something I rely on a lot and view as central to the enterprise.<br/><br/>(I'll emphasize that this is just one way of looking at this stuff. I know designers who prefer to call themselves "authors", and who specifically do not share my view of what game design is - for them it's just like writing fiction, rather than like building a building like I view it.)<br/><br/>As for how I've developed this eye for structure, Forge theory was a fundamental breakthrough for me starting in 2002. The big initial realizations concerned simply learning to look at the design work in the abstract: rather than making changes to pre-existing works and shuffling through their variations, I learned to view game design as part of a greater creative purpose, and the game object as a tool that the gaming group utilizes in achieving their goals. This fundamentally changes the way I tried to go about game design, as now I was not merely following instinct to self-satisfied dead ends, but rather viewing the utility of the entire thing I was creating, all at once.<br/><br/>Over the next five years or so my structural vision was greatly improved as I followed the Forge discourses through their development and gained concepts like "resolution system", "narration rights", "creative agenda", "reward cycle" and so on and so forth - an entire vocabulary for visualizing and expressing what precisely happens when people sit down to play. Of course polishing my analytical capability involved a lot of varied play and analysis of play, to learn to really see and understand creative motivations and how people express them, and how various types of game constructs impact them, but having other people doing the same thing and providing terminology, categorization and modeling speeded things along greatly.<br/><br/>Since that time my evolution as a designer has been more of evolutionary plodding than any great new insights. There are many things in the craft that are directly necessary for great design, such as a rich landscape of ideas, creative passion and good craft practice, all of which I improve upon as I may.<br/><br/>There's stuff I could write about my design process, but it'd be lengthy and rather idiosyncratic, so I'll pass on that for now. It's not nearly as simple as starting from some specific facet of a game and then working outwards from there, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469951/#Comment_469951" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T16:54:49+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  4:54PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2018 9:49PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -Reading, analyzing, and playing games. Start with the games that are closest to the type of game you want to design, but also look to other games that may have useful design technologies that may inspire your design; start with games that have similar design goals and are designed for the play-styles and aims that you want to support and achieve, and work out from there as though starting in the center of concentric circles.<br/><br/>-Take the games with the best design technologies that can inspire and help realize your design goals. You have to read, deeply analyze, and play a lot of games, in the design space your working in\u2014and in related design spaces\u2014before you can even recognize and breakdown these technologies and see which will best achieve your design goals. These technologies, probably adjusted somewhat to fit your exact goals, will be your starting point, from which you ask yourself \u201cwhat if\u201d questions in order to get closer to the best way to fulfill your design goals for the game. You will hone and perfect your game by spending a lot of time asking \u201cwhat if,\u201d questions, playtesting, and adjusting and modifying your game, and even being willing to rethink what seems fundamental and willing to \u201ckill you darlings.\u201d Expect this process to take years if you want your game to be amoung the best in the design space you\u2019re working in. By the time you\u2019re done with this process, your game will likely look quite different from the games and the technologies you used to inspired it. Hopefully, you will have created new technologies that further map out and contribute to the design space you are working in; if you are skilled, work hard and are determined, you may even produce something paradigm shifting. <br/><br/>-It is important you know what you are trying to achieve with your game design. Who is the game designed for and who isn\u2019t it designed for? What are your goals and how do the different elements of your design achieve these goals; there shouldn\u2019t be anything in your game that isn\u2019t there to achieve a specific goal and you should know the goals that the different elements of your game are trying to achieve. Again, you can\u2019t know what your goals are, or hope to achieve them, without first reading, deeply analyzing and playing lots of games. As you go through the process, your understanding and goals will adjust a little bit as you figure out exactly what you want, but you should start with a specific, and most importantly educated, vision, and that vision should be detailed. The first step on the road to design is education. The best way to achieve this education is through reading, studying, thinking and then thinking some more, and playing lots of games. The best education is in the games themselves\u2014especially, now that the most important (by which I mean useful) contemporary theoretical ideas and tools can largely be found and studied within the games themselves. Play the games, think and then think some more, and then build new tools.<br/><br/>P.S. I\u2019m using \u201cyou\u201d in the universal sense, Dreamofpeace, not trying to tell you, or anyone else, how to design or making any assumptions about where you are at in your knowledge as a designer. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469952/#Comment_469952" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T17:15:18+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  5:15PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally speaking, big ideological constructs about what games do and how they work help for organizing little ideas into a larger picture and understanding how they're all supposed to work together to create a more holistic experience<br/><br/>But when it comes to working out what those little pieces are actually going to be, I'm more inspired by seeing the ways that other games have tried to deal with similar concepts.

If that problem was "Hey, we're not sure what to do here?" then I needed to add procedure to make it clear what to do.<br/><br/>In default OSR D&amp;D, the "what am I supposed to do?" can be <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15147/roleplaying-games/game-structures-part-4-combat" rel="nofollow">pretty</a> <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15203/roleplaying-games/game-structures-part-11-complete-game-structures" rel="nofollow">straightforward</a>. If it's a dungeon crawl, you explore the dungeon, avoid the traps, find the monsters, kill the monsters, and loot the dungeon. Repeat until satisfied, and level up.<br/><br/>In Verge, it wasn't clear. There was no built-in goal for players. I kinda came at it sideways, and play with some groups was awesome and with other groups ground to a halt. A little push from the rules would have fixed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469983/#Comment_469983" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T18:54:28+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  6:54PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answer, thanks!

A good designer has to be able to not only look at a finished thing and perceive its structure, but to also be able to visualize a structure in their head. To design is to manipulate structures with intent; there are other types of creation that do not work like this, but "designing" is specifically this. I've become pretty good in this one facet of game design, so it's something I rely on a lot and view as central to the enterprise.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis is right on point. I agree that, what Eero calls, \u201cstructural vision\u201d is a very important factor. Although the essential insights of contemporary theory that I\u2019ve learned (almost entirely by osmosis) have been very helpful as a foundation, some of which Eero mentioned, I think being a talented game designer is in large part something you have intrinsically or you don\u2019t. Some people are higher in Openness on the big 5 personality inventory\u2014which is the only scientifically valid analysis of personality\u2014and this predicts their ability to understand things abstractly and their level of creativity. Most of us that are interested in these games are high in Openness so we assume others are as interested in ideas as we are, but in truth those people who are interested in abstract ideas are a small percentage of the overall population. So you largely either have this trait or you don\u2019t. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that trait Openness is associated with high intelligence. <br/><br/>This doesn\u2019t mean that skills as a designer can\u2019t be cultivated, which they most definitely can, but people with the ability to think abstractly will  have a leg up, and it will be a more difficult climb for those that think less abstractly. People who are less abstract will probably be more successful if they start by designing a game based on an already established game system and tech, and by doing a lot of play-testing and get a lot of feedback and suggestions about how to fix any issues. Designing this way will play to their strengths.<br/><br/>I\u2019m very much with Eero in that talent in the \u201cstructural vision\u201d arena is probably a necessity if you want to be exceptional, even if coming from an \u201cauthor\u201d perspective. It is certainly a leg up, if one has the ability to conceptualize things abstractly; to recognize patterns and systems and to manipulate them conceptually while understanding the consequences of doing so and intentionally producing specific end goals; being able to see the outcomes and shape these outcomes abstractly; knowing what the different elements and systems will do to meet the aims and play-style goals of a given game and how to configure and synthesize these components and systems while understanding  how they will interact and what the results of doing so will be, etc. Of coarse, one needs to be educated first, and read, analyze, and play a bunch of games before you can implement these talents. <br/><br/>I think most successful designers, which  design from an \u201cauthors\u201d stance, likely have these talants but come at design through a different lense and focus.  <br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>As for how I've developed this eye for structure, Forge theory was a fundamental breakthrough for me starting in 2002. The big initial realizations concerned simply learning to look at the design work in the abstract: rather than making changes to pre-existing works and shuffling through their variations, I learned to view game design as part of a greater creative purpose, and the game object as a tool that the gaming group utilizes in achieving their goals. This fundamentally changes the way I tried to go about game design, as now I was not merely following instinct to self-satisfied dead ends, but rather viewing the utility of the entire thing I was creating, all at once.</p></div></blockquote>\nMy instinct is that this was a very necessary and essential process, in order to create a paradigm for indie games and to bring out the best abstract ideas, as well as the schools of ideas that critiqued them. <br/><br/>For people like you and me, Dreamofpeace, I think this ground has already been paved. The most important and useful ideas and concepts have been establish and are readily available, the games themselves embody much of what was absolutely revolutionary but now seems obvious and commonplace (in indie games) yet is essential and absolutely crucial. We can essentially skim off the top rather than rehash the quagmire, and start to develop our own ideas and perspectives from there. Our work is ahead of us and we have the advantage of still having energy and enthusiasm\u2014and maybe even the naivety\u2014to push out into the unknown and to establish new territory in the newer design spaces that are evolving and are still yet to evolve. Perhaps, it is hubris, but I see a whole territories yet to be discovered in the GMless space; it is absolutely ripe for analyzes, innovation, new tech, etc. My interest in them isn\u2019t because I prefer them over PbtA-style games, it is because they are so ripe for innovation, and have room for improvement. <br/><br/>I see our optimism, as naive as it may be, as an asset. Fresh eyes are necessary. Can you imagine what the state of gaming would be right now without the Forge, without the innovation that came out of the indie space? It would be hideous. We owe it a tramedous dept. It was the Cambrian explosion as far as I\u2019m concerned. With luck, our fresh eyes and fresh blood can contribute to a new flourishing of ideas and concepts and most importantly to new games. Maybe there are Cambrian explosions yet to come. The artform is in its infancy after all.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Over the next five years or so my structural vision was greatly improved as I followed the Forge discourses through their development and gained concepts like "resolution system", "narration rights", "creative agenda", "reward cycle" and so on and so forth - an entire vocabulary for visualizing and expressing what precisely happens when people sit down to play. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nWhat would you say are the most essential concepts that have come out this discourse, which are still fundamental teachings and tools to fairly new designer, with a year or two of design experience?

I personally understand it in a very psychological, very concrete way: I discover in my own introspection the psychology that drives the creative action - makes a game rewarding for me - and then build up the game to fulfill those psychological needs to the utmost. For example, I deconstructed and reconstructed the entire textual history of D&amp;D in 2008-2010 in creative agenda terms, and have benefited of the roadmap ever since.<br/><br/>(I believe my understanding of creative agenda to be essentially orthodox, insofar as there is any real orthodoxy on Forge theory. Ron is famously anti-psychological as a rpg theorist, but that's him limiting himself and interpreting the world through his particular preferred interpretative lenses, not something about the theory itself.)<br/><br/>Second most important would be "reward cycle", meaning the iterative process of interaction between the creative agenda and the activities that actualize it in play, as players engage each other in Exploration. I'd say that doing next-level rpg theory - and design - is essentially impossible unless you understand how and why e.g. experience points may or may not be part of the actual reward cycle of a given game. (If you've seen Ron's diagrams - I hear that he's publicizing them now - then this is the thing he's writing about there.)<br/><br/>Third most important would be "coherence". It actually comes in at the very beginning of the design process, I only rank it third because people generally have at least <i>some</i> inborn understanding of that. For design purposes it mostly comes down to conceptualizing what "a game" is in an useful, functional way. For rpg design, particularly if you've been in the scene since before the millennium, coherence is a wrestling match between the tradition and your attempt at discarding what is unnecessary, to focus on the real.<br/><br/>Fourth comes "fruitful void". It is a supplementary concept to creative agenda, as it provides you the concept and language for a most significant idea, that of the specific freedom of expression defined by the framework set up by the game's rules. Without at least an instinctual understanding of the void you're in danger of killing your game by over-design that paves over the expressive element you were seeking to draw out in the first place.<br/><br/>Fifth comes "Exploration" (with its attendant breakdowns of elements and stances and so on), which is again something that is very fundamental and only comes up this late on my list because it's sort of a philosophical as opposed to a practical concept. You will find it useful for game design when working through exotic concepts that question the fundamentals of your understanding of the medium: in those moments it is useful to return to the basics and run through what actually defines the medium and its user interface.<br/><br/>I find myself annoyed with this list, because it's off the cuff, and I'm obviously forgetting many important things from it. Better than nothing, anyway. Somebody should write a book on this stuff.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, is there anything that you think would be specifically relevant to someone, like myself, who is designing in the GMless, collaborative, drama game space?

"GMed game" sort of makes sense in a cultural history way, as a reference to a monolithic historical understanding of how rpgs "have to" be; its complement of "GMless" is a theoretically meaningless expression, simply denoting that "this game has something going on that's not like your dad's D&amp;D campaign".<br/><br/>(Note that I'm not criticizing the idea of using "GMless" as a designated term of art or cultural shibboleth; it's no worse than "story game" in that regard. It's just that I don't think that there are any really major creative issues hanging off this minor issue of form - not unless you brazenly assume that "GM" automatically implies "the other players are passive drones in this game".)<br/><br/>It's like deciding to specialize in "non-car vehicles". While the concept of "car" is well-defined and significant and a meaningful engineering specialization, it's complement of "non-car" is rather less, as it includes such disparate things as boats, aeroplanes, bicycles...<br/><br/>That being the case, if I was for some weird reason tutoring you on this (the weird bit is my being a worthy tutor), I'd want to first of all ensure that you know how to deconstruct the concept of "GM". There's a Forgite theory concept of "GM tasks", a list of a bit over half a dozen different things that the GM concretely does in a traditional roleplaying game. Can you list them? Can you show how they can each, in theory, be assigned to different people at the game table? Can you show examples of games that split these tasks out in different ways that are neither traditionally GMed, nor completely symmetrically "GMless"? Can you do the same to the other traditional role, that of the "player"? In a word, can you pick apart the traditional roles of "GM" and "player", and rebuild them arbitrarily to conform to the creative needs of your current design? That's the goal, not just a blind insistence on distributing every task equally to every participant all the time.<br/><br/>The other thing I'd want to grill you on would be your understanding of the concept of "social contract" and how a gaming group commits to a coherent game with creative goals, and what different kinds of gaming social contracts are possible. This is because the traditional GM role insulates the activity of roleplaying from some major issues in this field, key among them the likes of "what if I'm serious and you're casual?", and "who among us actually cares about this game?" A GMless game may, depending on how exactly it is GMless, have all these monsters that the GM traditionally subjugates come up and take a bite out of the unsuspecting game designer's ass-flesh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469986/#Comment_469986" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T20:53:06+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  8:53PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff here from Eero.

Game design can be iterative, where you try something, adjust it, try it again, adjust it some more, add a piece, try it again, remove another piece, and so forth.<br/><br/>Harper says (restated in my own words, not a verbatim quote), "throw down a bit of a procedure or mechanic you want to use in your game, and go playtest it. For anything else in the game, which you don't know how to do yet, just use a coin flip - heads or tails. That's the simplest form of resolution. You'll see, in the process, what needs to be added, and where the coin flip is unsatisfying. (But, if it *is* satisfying, you've also just saved yourself a lot of trouble!)"<br/><br/>I'd encourage you to share bits and pieces of your drafts and ideas here - I think you'll get some great feedback. I would love to see the discussion between you and Eero take place in public, for example; it would be of tremendous interest to everyone, and I would happily participate, too (if my presence is wanted).<br/><br/>The recent history of indie publishing has shown that such "design in public" is one of the best ways to get people interested in and invested in your game - they are far more likely to get excited about it, talk about it (generating buzz on the internet), help playtest, support a Kickstarter, buy the product when it comes out, and so forth.<br/><br/>(Vincent started a trend with <i>Apocalypse World</i>, for example, by starting with playbooks and basic moves available for free, as he was designing them, and encouraging people to try them out. Now it's become fairly standard for PbtA design in general to imitate that - a cool new culture, I think, which everyone benefits from.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469989/#Comment_469989" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-14T02:00:55+00:00" title="February 14, 2018  2:00AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2018 2:01AM by zircher.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes it is constraints like Game Chef or any of the Game Jams out there.

Play them while designing because then you will look at them from a game designer's perspective. Also, start playtesting as soon as possible. Don't waste time on wasting words. Save time by playtesting the core first and then each subsystem specifically.<br/><br/>This page goes through the fundamental theories of game design. Read it, and - if you're actually interested - look up the resources mentioned. McCloud's Understanding Comics, Koster's Theory of Fun, Lazarro's Four Keys of Fun, LeBlanc's MDA, Cook's Skill Atom and feedback loops, Csikszentmihalyi's flow, and probably some more crucial knowledge I forgot.<br/><a href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/level-1-overview-what-is-a-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/level-1-overview-what-is-a-game/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470049/#Comment_470049" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-17T21:42:18+00:00" title="February 17, 2018  9:42PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Discussion (reading is a solitary discussion) and in the end playtesting.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470088/#Comment_470088" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T16:59:06+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  4:59PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non-fiction helps me a lot.
