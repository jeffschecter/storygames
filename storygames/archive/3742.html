This was my first experience with Agon either as a GM or a player, so the fact that the game proceeded with only minor rough patches is a testimony to its ease of play.  The three main parts of the night were character creation, some prequel scenes, and then the first (and only) quest.<br/>Chargen:  Character creation is very quick.  My flaw was in not having handouts for heroic feats because things slowed down a bit as the players had to share the one rule book.  Nathan played Leocidus, Ben played Milos, and John played Belos.     <br/>Prequel:  Festival at Troy in honor of Athena, giving thanks for victory at Troy.  We used the festival to tie the characters together with oaths.  The festival was followed by a voyage at sea during which the PCs had several contests:  saving the ship, surviving the storm, and fighting Poseidon's tritons.  I decided that the strife points spent on opposition in this prequel would come from the points for the first quest.  In effect, I spent 80-90% of the Antagonist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s strife points prior to play.  <br/>First Quest:  The heroes encounter Athena on the beach of an uncharted island.  In the distance, women warriors were preparing to put to sea in a war fleet.  Athena informed the PCs that they would be her answer to the Amazons' call for divine guidance.  The PCs mission:  stop the Amazons from going to war.  To do this, the heroes would have to plant the seed of life at the uprooted tree and water it with the sorrow of Pan.  The PCs proved themselves worthy emissaries of Athena by defeating the Amazons in a series of contests with sword, bow, and running.  Queen Hippolyte explained that their war was intended as punishment for King Eurystheus and Hercules. Not only had Hercules stolen Queen Hippolyte's belt, but he was also the cause of the destruction of the tree of Golden Apples-consumption of which allows the Amazons to become pregnant with Amazon babies.  Our heroes acquired the seed of life from the Amazons and set out to the Garden of Hera.  There, they confronted Decator, the hundred-eyed (and handed), brother of Argus Panoptes, who was the new guardian of that place.  They handily defeated the monster, with a javelin thrown 'really hard' by Leocidus.  In retrospect, I spent too many points on special abilities rather than improve the creature's stats.  But he was a worthy foe nonetheless and the key to his defeat was the teamwork between the characters in movement on the battlemap (to get each other into optimal weapons range) and the early attacks by Milos that whittled away Argus' armor for the other two heroes.  Planting the seed, the heroes waited a bit but then remembered that the must acquire the 'sorrow of Pan'.  "We have to make a Satyr cry!" they correctly concluded.  They found a satyr in nearby woods, cavorting with his seraglio.  One by one, they lured the women away as the satyr played his pipes.  This made the creature angry, not sad, so the heroes were forced to fight it into submission.  Defeated, the satyr stated that he had not cried for ages and was unlikely to do so.  This led to an extended non-battle conflict that the PCs eventually won as their tales or songs touched the satyr\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heart.  The satyr wept buckets, which the heroes collected in a helmet. <br/>Returning to Hera's garden, the PCs had one last encounter.  An old woman sat at the entrance, begging for a drink of water.  The PCs refused her the satyr's tears, despite her remonstrance.  But they did delay their quest long enough to find a spring of fresh water and bring some to the woman, who was, of course, Hera in disguise.  Finding them worthy, Hera allowed the heroes back into her garden so that they could water the Golden Tree and complete their first quest!<br/>All in all, it was a fun game that I really enjoyed.  The best part was watching the competition between the players as they pitted their characters against each other in contests not only of my devising, but ad hoc contests throughout the adventure.

I actually feel better, knowing he should have lasted longer and really put the fear of the gods in the heroes.  Ah, well.

Convert any hits you do to position bonuses instead of damage.
