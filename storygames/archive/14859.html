I've run into snags with physical books before, in years past, and they still bug the shit out of me.  <br/><br/>People seem to really want actual, physical books, though, so I've been walking through to get a good process, seeing if I can build up the capacity to say to myself "This is totally a lock."  I can add the perk to the IndieGoGo campaign, easily.<br/><br/><b>So here's where I'm at.  What I want to know is:  <i>Am I missing something?</i></b><br/><br/>1. IndieGoGo gives me the list of people; I get locations, etc.  This is one of my big "What do they give me, exactly?" bits; I don't know if they could just give me a shipping list.<br/><br/>2. As soon as the game hits 'zero edition' (closed tests done, plus a few playthroughs where I just watch with a clipboard), I send my files to the printer.  The printer is local to me - they're the "espresso machine" at the university I attend, and I have used them to print small runs twice now; Cog Wars and Ruritania.  The <i>printer</i> is a lock.<br/><br/>3. About two to five days later, I walk the box of books upstairs in the building where the printer is, accompanied by a clipboard.  On said board is a shipping list, and a stack of record sheets to go along with.<br/><br/>4. I buy a big stack of shipping envelopes at the post office in that building (they have them, I've checked), buy a coffee, sit down at a table, and pack.<br/><br/>5. I walk back into that post office and ship them all, right then.  I've already got the shipping costs - light international parcel shipping is $10 (I took in another book I've had printed at espresso and asked).<br/><br/>...............<br/><br/>This seems like a really tight plan, but I have to be missing something.   What usually goes weird on kickstarters and the like?  What are the edge cases, and such?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

Make sure to post an message saying that the buyer should be aware of customs regulations etc. I've seen Canadians get screwed with big book purchases through UPS because of tariffs, but I don't think anything kicks in until the $25-30 mark IIRC. So likely if the print ver is $20-25 there will be no issues with most countries.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Hand writing addresses on envelopes<br/>-- Never had a problem here either, but mainly because I only did 10-20 a day with some 30s. Pop in a DVD or turn on some serialized TV show while doing it helps pass the time.

Your go-live is $2000. That means that you have to have 200 people all kick in $20. If I were you, I'd try to come up with higher level buy-ins.

You're not tricking people by doing this, they will or will not decide to give more themselves. Frex, I bought a game from Kickstarter a few months back: I was intending to get the PDF only plus some little dinky bonus at around $20, but looking at the options, knowing more about the designer, and seeing the direction he was taking the material, I ended up kicking in for a bunch of extras making my donation at around $50-60 IIRC. I felt like giving that much! And the designer added options for rewards for the people who gave that much!

Whether it's go-or-no, I'll be writing up a big list of "how I used this, and errors you should not repeat".<br/><br/>So far:<br/><br/>-When the lady and I have donated to kickstarters, etc?  We used her credit card and screen name (lower interest rate).  This makes me look as if I'm not really in on the model, which is both not true and unfortunate.  Thing to avoid.<br/><br/>-IndieGoGo was written assuming "money is kept, regardless".  So there's no clear way to raise or lower your contribution amount - you have to pitch in again, and the person running the show has to tally up multiple-contributors.  Which is doubleplus annoying.  If I was in the $4000+ range, it'd be a problem in the potentially-crippling range for adding more perks; as it is, it's gonna require a note to contributors on the workaround.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* The book idea is good.<br/>* Perhaps some additional content (a sample scenario? designers' notes? 2-3 more pages' worth of content that will be made available to those backers first before it gets broadcast publicly?) for a higher 5-10 dollar buy in?

My main thing - the reason I'm thinking of just adding "book, or several, and stop there" is wanting to keep the core of the process as simple as possible.  That way, with a little help from people here, I can figure what can go wrong, and have a rehearsed method for that.  I think I already have a backup printer in case of failure there (they're doublechecking their price, and will call me back today), and the address thing says to me that I should write out the addresses <i>while the book is still at the printer</i>, so I can just pick up the books and stuff 'em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337823/#Comment_337823" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T11:37:29+00:00" title="August  9, 2011 11:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4.)

Can you just give me a stack of those customs sticker slips?"<br/><br/>4b.) Once the IndieGoGo is two days to closing, send out an email to all book-level backers saying, "Hello, please check the address you signed up with, to ensure it's the correct shipping address. The books ship in X days, and I want to make sure you all get your treasures."<br/><br/>4c.) Have sticker paper on hand (I already do, because I'm a vandal and that stuff's awesome). Create a sheet in excel or indesign or whatever that prints off your address in Column 1, your address in Column 2, customer's address in Column 3, another customer's address in Column 4.<br/><br/>4d.) When the IndieGoGo closes, or whatever time you decide to do this: Copy/Paste your customers' addresses into that sheet, and print it all out on sticker paper. Cut up, slap on envelopes.<br/><br/>4e.) You'll still have to do those customs declaration stickers by hand, but that's fine - the reason you brought them all home is so that you could do them in blocks of 10-15. Do some, then play with LEGOS, then do some, then have coffee, then do some, then eat a sandwich.<br/><br/>5.) Take it all to your post office, finished.

(And people feel better about giving their money to a "professional".)<br/>- Address labels are easy to read. Addresses are read primarily by computers. Use a simple font on an address label and you decrease the chances for a shipping mishap.<br/>- You should be keeping records. Contact information for previous customers is some of the best record information you can possibly have. You can use that to let people know about your next project.
