Now you are all small fish in an ever-expanding pond that is constantly devouring other ponds.<br/><br/>Someone among you took the lead in getting you to Dis alive.

Sure, all of the architecture seems to be littered with eyes and hands but something about this joint feels like home, dammit. Explain to the GM why you want to rent that place so badly. The owner, a one-eyed recovering wizard (recovering?), likes the idea of renting to new refugees, as it reminds him of when he first got here, fresh from Greyhawk City.<br/><br/>Chunks of your world are still floating on the top of the stew that is Dis. When your GM rolls on the job table, he will insert an element of the Forgotten Realms as either the Patron, Target or Job Type. The GM could describe a job and ask you what about that job is actually a piece of the Realms and how your character recognizes it.<br/><br/>The one-eyed former death cult wizard will hold the space for you for a few days while you do some honest or dishonest freebooting.<br/><br/>Hugs &amp; Kisses,<br/><br/>Your GM                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412388/#Comment_412388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-21T21:04:50+00:00" title="April 21, 2013  9:04PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Wardens,<br/><br/>Your last mission from the Sultana just finished.

The future you wrote for yourself - as lord of a shining castle in the free mountains, lady of a noble mage's college in the bustling city, rogue captain of your merry band wandering the scented wilderness - is gone, and replaced with the smoking pits and oily fetid pools that stretch to the horizon beyond the mechanical creaking of a waking god. Dis, unwelcome Lord of claustrophobia and scarcity and smoke has wrapped and choked your free lands in pipes, sewers, and creaking tenements as first light cracked the egg of night. <br/><br/>You must make a new future for yourselves, fitting into the orgiastic misery of the swelling billions that call Dis their home. Everyone here is a refugee making themselves anew and forgetting the heavy past. <br/><br/>For each of you, roll+WIS:<br/><br/>On a 10+, you are relatively easy of heart and quickly leave behind your old stories, accepted into the fold of some new guild or society. Only on rare occasions do you fall into the abyss of a drunken or drugged binge.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you can mimic the empty grin of the urban masses, fitting in, but you acquire one of these:<br/><br/>-Nightmares of your pillaged home and lost loves<br/>-A nervous habit - twitching eye, alcohol, drugs, compulsive behavior of one kind or another.<br/><br/>On a miss, you are consumed with sorrow.

You, however, have decided you can't wait that long. As members of the gifted-but-inexperienced crew, An Immortal Ruckus [or insert your crew's name here], you got tired of being straight-up destroyed by ever mediocre MC in the year 4268 of the Sultana's reign, so you've magically time-traveled 3,000 years in the past to "invent" hip-hop and become the undisputed Lordz of Dis.<br/><br/>Have your best MC roll+CHA to see how this has gone so far:<br/><br/>On a 10+, you have successfully cultivated a small but vibrant scene. Sure, the music isn't quite what you had in mind, since it's often a couple of fiddle players doing ragtime in the background while one of you beats out a rhythm on a cast-iron kettle, and your crowds are mostly ratmen and spiderfolk so far, but it's a start, right? And this one spider, who calls herself The Most Loquacious Widow, would honestly be quite sick on the mic, if there were actual mics, and if you could prevent her from stopping to feed on audience members in the middle of her set.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, there's not a scene exactly, but it hasn't been a complete catastrophe. You've gotten a regular gig at a small, slime-covered bar near the old river and there's a crowd of folks who you suspect are necromancers and diabolists who show up every Sultanasday to hear you spit. Afterwards, they come up and converse with you about "where the rhymes come from" and their connection with the dark arts, which is cool but also a bit creepy. Let me know if you've hooked up with any of the more attractive sorcerers yet.<br/><br/>On a 6-, come on, you think you were the only crew who'd thought of this idea? There's a well-established cross-temporal guild known as the Elemental Guardians who make it their business to protect the "proper" (that is to say, temporally linear) development of hip-hop in the known planes. History and context, they claim, matter a lot in preserving the authenticity of the medium and its natural spread. While you appreciate their theoretical position, it's hard to have a conversation when they're hunting your asses down. Can you escape, or defeat them in an epic, magical rap battle across time, space, and the 63 boroughs of Dis?<br/><br/>Hugs and kisses,<br/>Your GM                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412478/#Comment_412478" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T15:32:36+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  3:32PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Heresarch Walton of the Darkest Heart, <br/><br/>You are melting my brains for reals. <br/><br/>My jar runneth over, but it's got a lid. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412494/#Comment_412494" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T20:05:12+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  8:05PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2013 8:05PM by Benhimself.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear survivors,<br/><br/>So you think you're hot shit, since you came from that desert world where magic sucks life out of the land, draconic sorcerer-kings rule the few paltry scraps of civilization with iron claws, and everyone is a hard-as-nails badass, huh?

The ship took a lot of damage on the way in, so you'll need to find a way to repair it once you've succeeded in your last-ditch mission to save the world. The city seems to extend forever, but the science officer found traces of various trans-planar and gateway technologies down there. There must be way back home, and places to get the parts you need.<br/><br/>Have the communications officer roll +Wis to establish what you've worked out.<br/><br/>On a 10+, you've managed to come to a cordial arrangement with a loose coalition of aliens. They'll help you out, and you'll help them out in turn. They say their objective is to reclaim their world and create a mystical buttress to keep Dis from attacking again. On the downside, one of your old enemies is also involved in this coalition. Who is it, and how did your last encounter end?<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you've managed to come up with a cover and blend in, staying at what passes for a hotel here. "Pilgrims from a distant parish" seems to cover any faux pas or searching question! Investigating in disguise, you have established that the ruler of this evil empire is the Sultana, and that her secret police - the Road Wardens - will be your primary enemies. Now you just need to find a way into her palace...<br/><br/>On a 6-, you have no idea what's going on. A tough group of slavers nabbed you while you were all still recovering from the landing.

A masked messenger just arrived, inviting you to tea with the Sultana.  <br/><br/>On 7-9, that <i>bastardo</i> Mussolini got there first and rules the parish, leaving you to share a room with the other Popes.
