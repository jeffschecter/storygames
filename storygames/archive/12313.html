A couple of them had played Archipelago II before but this was my first opportunity to play a "Norwegian style" game.  For some games you have a sense that it's going to be good for you just from reading the game, knowing your own preferences in play, and knowing your fellow players' general likings.  But you never know for sure until you get it to the table.  I really enjoyed it and I think everyone else did as well!  I'm thankful for everyone joining me on short notice as I'm facilitating it at GPNW next Sunday and wanted to do a dry run beforehand.  <br/><br/>Our cast: King Ragnar (Colin), The Earl of Gardariki (David), Brand, the Knight (Brendan), Princess Valgerd (Jim), and the Sei\xf0kona Runa, (myself).<br/><br/>The rules are brief and I'd read them three times but as no one else had seen the game prior, I read from the book quite a bit to explain how the game is played.  I knew this probably wasn't the best method but I wanted to explain the game exhaustively; even though the procedures are simple, there are some details that seem especially important to emphasize.  A couple of the play modes were outside my experience, especially the role of the game's Theme Guide and their authority over a player's character's Themes.<br/><br/>Sitting to the right of Colin (King Ragnar), I had authority over the King's Themes of Ancestors and Law.  At one point the King blustered to the Gar\xf0ariki messenger Mord that his three generals, the brothers Harald, Hro\xf0gar, and Hogni would be sufficient to match the Eastern armies gathering at his borders.  Mord (David) presented the King with the head of Hogni (killed earlier on the orders of the Earl).  The King staggers at the audacity and impossibility of what he is seeing.  At this point, I offer that the ancestral Laws require the King to thank his guest (the messenger) for the gift, even one as horrific as this.  As Guides all of the players have the option to use the phrase, "<i>Do it differently</i>," if they think my offer is inappropriate to the story, but no one does and my narration stands.  In this case, I was creating a fact about the world and the King's lawful obligations to that fact, but the Theme Guide can even narrate the spotlight characters' actions, making the Princess rebellious, the Earl treacherous, and so on.<br/><br/>I liked this feature of the game.  Each of the players was themselves acting towards their character's Themes, but having that Theme Guide was like having a daemon on your right shoulder to drive actions or create world facts that you yourself may not have thought of.  <br/><br/>The whole game has well-wrought creative constraints that seem to help its players towards making an engaging story together.  The Theme Guides, the Phrases, the Location cards each with their own possible Events (directed by the Event Guide), along with the three questions on each of the character's sheets.<br/><br/>We ended up used the "<i>Do it Differently</i>" phrase quite a bit, which I was happy to see.  I think it probably always accomplished a better result, and with no hard feelings among the players.  David and Colin and I have a good comfort level with each other with suggesting alternative narration from playing PTA together; I wonder how well it works among players who've not played together before.<br/><br/>I think we only used the "<i>That might not be quite so easy</i>" phrase four times during the course of the whole game; we were providing each other with enough twists and uncertainty without needing to use it much.  I think I tried most often to draw it out from others by asserting my Sei\xf0kona as having accomplished several difficult things.  I think the Resolution cards are fun.<br/><br/>I didn't use the phrase "<i>More Details</i>" much (ever?) because people were providing quite a bit of detail on their own and I was concerned about the time.  Jason tells me he's never gone over two-and-a-half hours playing LitToS, but it took us about four-and-a-quarter hours to get through it all, including the rules explanation and a warm-up exercise to practice the phrases that was much more abbreviated than what is recommended in the text for your first time playing (we warmed up with one scene using BSG's Starbuck, Cmdr. Adama and Col. Tigh).  I definitely got some ideas on how I can abbreviate some of these things for next time so that we can get to playing more quickly.  I think I'd also take a stronger facilitator role in the future in directing the scenes to keep them shorter than they were.  The game text indicates only that the spotlight player decides when the scene is over and provides a phrase for the other players to <i>extend</i> the scene but not to wrap it up.<br/><br/>All the players really got into a Shakespearean vibe and our story ended up like an even more tragic King Lear with death, madness and regret all around.  Lots of wonderful re-incorporation of events and omens too.  Thanks everyone for playing!  I'm looking forward to revisting this game often starting next Sunday.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276067/#Comment_276067" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T04:26:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  4:26AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is so metal! I love the severed head, and using your Theme responsibility to make that even more horrible. That's genius, and exactly what the game can deliver when you are on the ball - using your authority to immediately recontextualize and heighten someone's creative contribution. <br/><br/>The application of phrases is very, very group specific. I find that my group uses "<i>That might not be quite so easy</i>" all the time to aggressively frame scenes, since it immediately prompts resolution and imparts forward momentum. If you are concerned with condensing the game into 2.5 hours at GPNW, definitely encourage going to resolution more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
