The second link, I think, has a female hikikomori, which is <em>interesting</em>, actually, but so far all actual play seems to be focused in Japan.<br/><br/>And that bugs me. It stinks of appropriation.<br/><br/>But then again, note what the text says in page 3 of the book:\n<blockquote><cite>Ewen Cluney\u2019s <a href="http://dsg.neko-machi.com/hikikomori.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hikikomori</a> says:</cite>While the hikikomori phenomenon is most common in Japan (there\u2019s supposedly at least 50,000 there), similar things are happening in South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and it\u2019s not unthinkable for it to happen in any post-industrial country.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd I thought to myself: Well, the United Kingdom is a post-industrial country.<br/><br/>And I remember reading the N.H.K. The manga resonated with me, because, during a period between 2002-2003, that <em>was</em> me in London. To a far more understated degree.<br/><br/><a href="http://nyarlathotep.dreamwidth.org/tag/hikikomori+rpg" rel="nofollow">You know where this is going</a>.<br/><br/>(x-posted <a href="http://nyarlathotep.dreamwidth.org/636.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226637/#Comment_226637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T02:11:52+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  2:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've run it. <a href="http://nyarlathotep.dreamwidth.org/tag/hikikomori+rpg" rel="nofollow">It's done</a>.<br/><br/>Gotta say this, Ewen; while I've only scratched the surface of gameplay so far, when you say you didn't do any playtesting for this game, it kind of shows.<br/><br/>I remember someone mentioning that the game has some positive feedback loops that, once embarked on, was pretty hard to get off. In my case it was the Rescuer-with-no-other-traits-train. Once I dropped the Obsessive Hobby trait, everything I did to either mitigate or reverse the gains that the Rescuer would pile into my Hope dice was... futile. Nothing I did could stop the 1 Hope and 1 Rescuer dice I would get, <em>guaranteed</em>, every day.<br/><br/>And it killed the narration as a result. The story became, in essence, the Rescuer slowly coaxing away the shut-in into society -- which, if I remember correctly from my and other people's experiences, never truly happens, not at least in that way. Even tried to get my character to commit suicide, just to see what happened. Not a dent. Next day, the same cycle happened over and over again.<br/><br/>The game most definitely, I'm sure you can agree, needs refinement. One of the things you can do is make it incredibly easy to transition from negative to positive situations, and vice-versa. Some kind of volatility in what happens might actually for more interesting and intense storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
