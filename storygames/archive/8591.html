If you're especially brave, you might try to run it for your friends. It's strange, but it produces interesting and fun stories (at least in prior versions).<br/><br/>This round of revisions include a complete rewrite of the resolution system, inspired by <i>In a Wicked Age</i>. It's way simpler than the RISK-dice version. It's post-victory stakes negotiation, "with a stick," as Vincent says about IaWA. It's "if you don't do X in the fiction, I will do one of these pre-approved things to you via network changes." It should work much better than the old system.<br/><br/>I've tightened the language a lot. I finally came up with names for the !'s (surges) and ?'s (drains). The radio broadcasting terminology pervades. Signal and noise, frequency and signal strength, surges, drains. Where will it stop? <br/><br/>I will run this thing Wednesday evening (1/28) for my "traveling group." I'll revise after that, as needed, and then I'm running it as a scheduled event at Dreamation.

I've been keeping an eye on Verge for a long time. It's one of my inspirations for the Pentasystem.<br/><br/>A few things. This sentence - <br/><br/>"That increased attention on the Religion node belies how valuable the node is to the players."<br/><br/>This is a common misuse of a word. "Belies" means that the outward appearance <i>doesn't</i> match the reality, which in this case is not so. You mean "betrays", or, better, "demonstrates".<br/><br/>Further down, "At the highest level, the game has three main phases: compile, link, and run." You then describe four phases including "load".<br/><br/>Also, "You can repeat the load and run phases, creating new characters in your setting, and telling new stories from their perspectives." According to your descriptions these are the link and run phases, not the load and run phases.<br/><br/>"You can have a good game with just two other people but it'll lack and it's really tough to have any real game interaction with just one other person." It'll lack what?<br/><br/>Character auction. "You earned tokens in the Load phase." But the Load phase is described after the Link phase in the document.<br/><br/>"The player with the highest bid pays his chips back to the bank and circles the character, who is her character now." Alternating gender pronouns, fine, but it just gets confusing if you do it in the same sentence while referring to the same person.<br/><br/>"(run by players or the game master)". I thought there was no GM now? (Oh, but later on there's a discussion of the GM's role, so maybe there is.)<br/><br/>Does Bobbi have an "e" or not?<br/><br/>"In step 2, you each write down concept" - should be "a concept".<br/><br/>Looks good, though, Adam, and I like the dice rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190454/#Comment_190454" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T14:43:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  2:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2009 2:45PM by Adam_Dray.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the edits!

The GM Advice section I need to write needs to make it clear how to shove the players into action. I have some ideas. Part of it is making sure that the network screams conflict in the first place. That advice is already in the Load chapter. The rest is a set of techniques for the GM to push conflict onto players. That advice needs to be in the Run chapter.<br/><br/>The token economy is probably still <i>all wrong</i>.

But leaving it blank or vague is not going to help. <br/><br/>What if you had some kind of GM procedure for which conflict to go to first? Here I am thinking of Dogs in the Vineyard's hierarchy of sins. To a degree, the "conflicts" web strands in Verge are like a non-hierarchal version of this.

I suspect that after Load, the players have this huge pile of tokens. Like 20-25 each. Maybe some get lost in character bidding. Maybe that evens players out a bit. Most likely, though, they just agree on who plays what and spend 3-6 tokens a piece there. So players are starting the game with 15-20 each. <br/><br/>Then they get 3 a turn. Maybe that's too many. Then they can cash out success dice for tokens in conflicts. So I'm a bit nervous.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to get rid of the Cash Out option and just count up the points and use it to determine the order in which players choose characters, but not give them tokens for all that. Then everyone just gets three tokens a turn.<br/><br/>As for GM procedures, you're right about the Load-to-Run bottleneck. Let me ask you though: In traditional games like Vampire, is there a set procedure for the GM? I mean, make shit up and harass the players with it, right? The Verge network is largely Situation. I think it was Fred Hicks who told me, "If a group of players can't find something to do in the network, they're not trying." I don't entirely agree with that sentiment myself, but it nags me.<br/><br/>The way *I* generally run Verge is to look at the connections characters have, figure out what is important to them, pick the biggest and baddest NPC or organization and make it start attacking characters or things they care about. It doesn't even have to be an intentional attack. It can be stuff like, "Megasoft just bought out your insurance company. Your daughter is really, really sick and they're refusing to cover her extremely expensive medical care." Then the player can react to that, find a new way to make money perhaps, or start doing evil stuff to Megasoft like hacking them. <br/><br/>I need to capture that general procedure in the GM advice section. <br/><br/>I want the network to drive play to an extent, but I don't want players to lose sight of the real fiction, which is between the strands of the web.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190517/#Comment_190517" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T07:36:03+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  7:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>In traditional games like Vampire, is there a set procedure for the GM?

In other words, you basically start with what you think would be cool to happen and work backwards to the situation that makes that cool thing happen. Not possible in Verge. There's going to be all kinds of shit on the web you had no idea would be there until 10 minutes ago.<br/><br/>As for "finding something to do", that's fine, and maybe it's how things should be after things get moving, but you've got a really beautiful start point built in and it would be a shame to let it go to waste with "do whatever you want!!" infecting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190520/#Comment_190520" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T08:04:32+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  8:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically, all the situation on the network should be stuff the players care about, or they wouldn't have created it. <br/><br/>What's that "beautiful start point" you're talking about?

I'd have to agree with Fred though, my experience when we played several years ago was that the network tells you what's important and the !'s reinforce that even more. I wonder if the problem is you've been playing with more traditional players who are used to what I call "gentle scene framing."<sup>1</sup> My experience with those kind of players is they find the whole, "Okay set a scene. What's the conflict!?! Fight!" very disturbing, and Verge seemed to require that type of aggressive scene framing. If you don't want aggressive scene framing, then I see how the network is difficult, and I'm trying to imagine how you could satisfy gentle scene framing and still build with the network. I'm having a hard time imaging how.<br/><br/>Do you want aggressive scene framing, and what are the folks you've tested with used to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190530/#Comment_190530" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T09:23:56+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  9:23AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a good idea what you mean by aggressive scene framing, but I'm not sure. I mean, I play games with scene framing all the time (Shock: and Annalise, for example). Do you consider those "aggressive"?<br/><br/>My testers have run the gamut from "I have never gamed" to "I play D&amp;D" to "I only play weird indie games."<br/><br/>Play procedure, as written, is to play freeform and stay the fuck away from the network and dice until something in play smells like it's a change to the network -- adding, strengthening, or weakening nodes or edges, or changing control of a node -- then the dice slam down.<br/><br/>The freeform play is framed in scenes though. The player and GM work together to establish the "stage" (where the action is taking place) and focus the "camera" (a metaphor to remind people to think of sensory detail in a cinematic way) on the action. <br/><br/>When you talk about "aggressive" scene framing, I think you mean formal procedures for establishing scenes combined with some kind of formal stakes setting. Verge doesn't do stakes setting. Like I said before, you role-play freeform until it's well understood that all the stuff you're role-playing about requires some kind of change to the network. Then you fight with dice. Then the winner can force those network changes down your throat by paying a typical cost in tokens, or you can negotiate a settlement of some other kind (usually in terms of the system). If you have played <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, you recognize the "negotiation with a stick" aspect of this. I can do no better than to steal ideas from Vincent.<br/><br/>Really, what the dice do is let you vie for control over a single node or edge on the network. If you already have control (or the controller's permission), you don't have to touch the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

In the latter, the GM is in control over "what's there" much more, and can push the initial situation much more than they can in Verge, where many others are pulling and pushing in different directions throughout the situations' creation. That's not a good thing or a bad thing, that's just a reason for there to be a strong and specific procedure for GMs to follow to get things rolling, because they don't start out with their hands on all the levers that a traditional GM does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192919/#Comment_192919" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T10:09:27+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 10:09AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Corley called me on the phone for 2.5 hours last week.

Cross-posted here for ease of discussion with YOUSGUYZ.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://verge.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Verge</a> claims to be a cyberpunk game. Well, technically, it claims to be a post-cyberpunk game; I suspect I need to write a short section that explains both cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk are.<br/><br/>Last week, Verge's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> fan, Jason Corley*, asked me why I think Verge is a cyberpunk game. Between the two of us, and later amended by Raffaele Manzo (rafu) on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Story Games</a>, we came up with an answer. In several parts:<ul><li> The game connects ideas in strange ways, in a postmodern way. Certain cyberpunk authors do this, too. For example, Neal Stephenson's <i>Snow Crash</i> connects software viruses, Sumerian mythology, and Samurai sword-fighting.</li><li> Specifically, the game asks you to connect technologies, ideologies, and organizations. These are the bedrock of 80's cyberpunk. </li><li> The way the network connects ideas can feel a little strange, even schizophrenic, the way a Philip K. Dick story feels (to me, anyway). </li><li> The characters in the game tend to be "free agents." This is a common cyberpunk trope. </li><li> The game focuses a lot of mechanical attention on <i>control</i>. This is another cyberpunk trope. </li><li> Free agents + technology + control vs. organizations (authority) + ideologies = cyberpunk. </li><li> The game has a mechanic that lets you "burn" your friends to get ahead. Another cyberpunk trope. </li><li> The mechanics of the game have a cyberpunk "feel": a network with nodes and edges, "signal and noise" dice, etc. </li></ul><hr/><br/>* Jon Eisenstein is Verge's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> fan, since he's played every version of the game since I started writing it. But Jason has run independent playtests and called me long-distance to tell me how to make Verge better, so he's vying for that spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193259/#Comment_193259" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T11:14:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 11:14AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I added a <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/index.php/Verge_Overview#Cyberpunk" rel="nofollow">section</a> about what I think Cyberpunk is. Embedded for your reading pleasure.<br/><br/>Comments?<br/><hr/><br/><br/><b>Cyberpunk</b><br/><br/>Ostensibly, Verge is a cyberpunk game. I treat post-cyberpunk and transhumanism as sub-genres. The term "cyberpunk" means different things to different people. Here's what I think.<br/><br/>Cyberpunk is a kind of science fiction, usually set in the near future. The genre grew out of the Eighties, when corporations and government were taking over the world, but at the same time there was this huge technology boom. Perhaps most importantly, personal computers were showing up in people's houses. So cyberpunk literature was dark -- in fact it was noir -- and its pessimism stared into the future and saw all kinds of huge organizations taking over the world, fracturing the vast government control we grew up in, and suppressing human rights. I suspect this paranoia was inherited from the influence of Philip K. Dick, largely considered to be the father of cyberpunk, though he died in 1982 and most of his writing didn't really become famous until they started turning his stories into movies.<br/><br/>Of course, cyberpunk authors also saw people fighting back. These rebels weren't well organized. In fact, they didn't like working with other people at all. These were free agents who were experts in narrow fields, often technological fields. These were independent-thinking anti-heroes like Case and Molly in Neuromancer and Hiro Protagonist and Y.T. in Snowcrash. These people fought The Man for their own selfish reasons but often they seemed to fight because no one else could.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common Cyberpunk Themes</span><br/><br/>The genre seems to have collected a number of ideas, or tropes.<br/><br/>Some kind of virtual reality is one of the most common. Whether the setting's "otherworld" is a realistic place that you can step into (even masquerading as your real life, as in The Matrix) or just a huge construct of line graphics or data, cyberpunk stories usually have some kind of "world of information" that characters explore or travel to learn and hide.<br/><br/>Really, the idea of virtual reality grows out of the genre's deeper treatment of reality-as-illusion, in general. Look at movies like Bladerunner and The Matrix and you'll see themes about the sketchy and untrustworthy nature of reality. Pretty much any movie adapted from a Philip K. Dick story will play with this theme: Bladerunner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Imposter, Next, A Scanner Darkly.<br/><br/>Hidden in a lot of cyberpunk stories is the idea of divine ascension, that man can rise to the level of godhood through technology. This theme borrows from transhumanist goals, which see mankind's potential as limitless. Within this theme are the subthemes of cybernetics (technological body modification), human-computer interfaces (often direct-to-brain), advanced mind- and body-enhancing pharmaceuticals, and vastly increased lifespans (near immortality).<br/><br/>On the flip side, cyberpunk also envisions computers becoming gods. Real artificial intelligence (AI) technology may be a long way off, but it appears frequently in the genre. These software beings often have goals that are alien and hard for people to understand. Sometimes, they just want to eradicate the world of human life (see Terminator). Some AIs are friendly and helpful, though.<br/><br/>One last trope worth exploring is corporate control. Cyberpunk seems to think that national governments are losing power to the corporations. These mega-companies span the globe, perhaps even star systems. They don't really answer to any government. If they do, the government is just an inconvenient obstacle. They have their own security, their own sovereign lands, and citizens. They often have "black ops" who do dirty work for them. They have become governments in their own right.<br/><br/>When you play Verge, keep these ideas in mind. Don't feel the need to incorporate all of them. Hell, if you have your own ideas, you're not required to use any of these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193282/#Comment_193282" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T12:33:16+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 12:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always connected cyberpunk to noir, but as an explanation for what you think it is and what you are targetting, this is excellent stuff.<br/><br/>By the by, I potentially have a playtest scheduled for Saturday, so if that "control" section can be fleshed out a bit by then it would be a big help. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193286/#Comment_193286" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T13:01:58+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  1:01PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did mention noir in the text: "So cyberpunk literature was dark -- in fact it was noir..."<br/><br/>The control stuff is already there!

Two players supported the GM against another player; the remaining player was a free agent in the scene, but later joined her dice with the lone player to beat me back.<br/><br/>However, the token economy is fucked up. Everyone had enough tokens (even after three scenes each) that they never wanted for them. People just bought whatever they wanted.
