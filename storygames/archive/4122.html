He has a demon tattoo which grants him elemental powers. We learned from his Legend that he was from a family of demon tamers, but was now an orphan. The tattoo's name is Riku, and it moves around on his body. In order to make use of its powers, Ryuu has to expose the tattoo . His four Charms are elemental in nature, and cover most of the bases: <i>Can make an earthen shield to defend himself</i>, <i>Can make things out of metal</i>, <i>Can run like the wind</i>, etc. One of his Taboos prevents his using his powers in water, and of course he has no water elemental spells.<br/><br/>In the short intro I ran (solo for him), he was new to a middle school and during track and field day was one of the last two kids to be picked for a soccer team; since Ryuu was wearing a scarf that day (Riku the demon was on his neck), naturally the other kids were reluctant to pick him because he was different. The other kid was a girl named Yumiko, and so the team captains devised a series of challenges between them to determine who would be picked next to last and who would be very last (challenges like dribbling the ball around cones, sudden death soccer shoot-out, etc.) Eventually Ryuu was picked (after using his powers only once), but coming home from school he found a note in his book bag: "I know what you are and I'm watching you". Getting off the school bus and caught in a freak rainstorm (!?!), he was confronted by Yumiko, all pink platform sneakers, bubble gum, and bangles bangles bangles. Oddly enough, not a hair on the girl was wet (!!!) She called him out, and as she pointed her bangles slid away to reveal an illegible demon tattoo (dun dun duh!). Big 'supers' type fight, with Yumiko engineering water attacks (a bus drowning him in with a huge spout as it drove by, a collapsed gutter overhead, etc. Ryuu had no powers of course, but he managed to narrate dodges and ultimately ran away. Story to be continued ...<br/><br/>I don't read Manga, but my son does, and so this was a fun time for him. I was pleased we got to play together, and also that <b>Seven Leagues</b> handled the unanticipated genre (magic schoolkids in contemporary Japan) reasonably well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
