<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/DarbysHeroesBRENTWOLKE.pdf" rel="nofollow">Darbyâ€™s Heroes</a><br/><br/>Brent Wolke worked off of my character sheet submission, and since Iâ€™ve read through and thought about his game, I figured Iâ€™d give my impressions and a brief backstory on the sheet.<br/><br/>SHEET BACKSTORY<br/>Part of my box oâ€™ gaming props is a Liarâ€™s Dice game: 6 colored cups, each with 5 matching-color dice. My young daughters love rolling these gorgeous rainbow dice, and weâ€™ve invented some simple games using them.<br/><br/>One evening, I started to think about how I might use them in a RPG design. Each color might represent some different way of accomplishing things, and each player could be largely defined by the â€œshapeâ€ of the colors in his dice pool.<br/><br/>Then, the next day, I saw Kevinâ€™s rev/eng challenge. I immediately cranked out a simple sheet that sort of hand-wavingly suggested some of the embryonic ideas I had about the game I might make to feature the rainbow dice.<br/><br/>DARBYâ€™S HEROES<br/>Overall, I quite like what Brent did with his game. The segmentation of the colors into different realms of ability seems very strong, and I like the way he carried the color theme over into the structure of play. The White and Black scene concepts seem like a good way of rounding out the whole package, allowing individuals to be spotlighted in different ways.<br/><br/>The high concept struck me a cool, amusing, and weird all at the same time. Mixing leprechauns and fairies with WWII seems crazy, but it just might work. My main concern for the concept is that the two ingredients seem to pull against each other in some important aspects. In particular, part of the allure of a WWII game for me will be the grittiness and themes of what men do under insane circumstance. And while bringing magic into the mix seems <em>awesome</em>, the mental image of a fairy shatters all that for me. So, maybe the combination can work for some people. But I think Iâ€™d prefer a way to get a magic-WWII combo that is better able to maintain â€œgravitas.â€<br/><br/>The dice economy wants to be worked with a lot, I think. Somewhere there is a good system, but it may take several iterations to get it. It is in this area where I think ditching the character sheet will provide the most benefit. Without having to worry about being artificially constrained by the specifics on the sheet, Brent should be able to get a very workable system that gives players real choices about when and how to use their strategic resources.<br/><br/>My last suggestion is to expand upon the structural rules in order to provide more support for chaining scenes together and chaining missions for campaign play. I like the color-coded mission concepts, and would like to see more work done in that area, because I think it might prove to be quite fruitful given what Brent already has going. I think the rules for White and Black scenes need to be revamped along with the dice economy with an eye toward ongoing campaign play.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m eager to see what Brent does as the game evolves, particularly in the dice economy aspect. Iâ€™m excited to play it once it gets a little more love, even if I wind up having to make a minor high concept shift to keep the fairies out of my head. Well done!                </div>

                            Mark,<br/><br/>Hey, thanks for the nice words. I've thought a lot about DH, and would really like to take this game further. As explained in the AP thread, everything is a bit wonky, especially the dice mechanics, but I do believe I can make it something special with further work.<br/><br/><i>When</i> I get this perfected and published, you can count on a copy, gratis.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Brent                        </div>
