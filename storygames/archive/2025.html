                    In the tradition of the <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/12/campaign_prepar.html" rel="nofollow">Art Deco Melodrama thread</a> and inspired by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2022&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">this SG thread, Calibrating Thematic Opposition.</a><br/><br/>Three of us, Brand and Shreyas +1 more will go through Spirit of the Century Chargen (assuming Brand has access to the book) and I'll go over how I'd mediate that process and how I'd navigate the flags on the character sheet to make the first adventure hum.<br/><br/>If this thread could only be the four of us for a while, that'd be great and we'll all chime in once we're done or branch off into other threads.<br/><br/>Before I talk any shit about the fiction, I'll want one more person, to know that Brand and Shreyas have access to the SotC book and then we'll bang on this for a few days.<br/><br/>Cool?                </div>

                            Phase 1: Brainstorming<br/><br/>Fantastic, so its Shreyas, Brand and Alan.<br/><br/>Matthew, thanks for being a sport.<br/><br/>The one thing we can all agree on about pulp is that it was incredibly broad. After that, shit starts to break down for this genre that engulfs magazines that were printed from the 20's to the 50's and still effects comic books today. <br/><br/>So, rather than trip over what one person thinks is pulpy and another doesn't, I present some choices. <br/><br/>Feel free to alter and brainstorm until we get to where we want to be. <br/><br/>Don't think of a character just yet, let's all get there together. <br/><br/>1) We could just go with pulp madness, embracing the idea that this group could very well be Indiana Jones, Rocketeer and the Shadow all suiting up at the local Century Club to fight giant robots and such.  I'm running that with my buddies at home now and its loads of fun. <br/><br/>We could have a unified group such as: <br/><br/>2) Doc Savage's posse: maybe the man of brass is dead and it is left to all of you to carry on your mentor's legacy or an adventuring family. <br/><br/>3) Plucky Reporters: You are staff on the official newspaper of the Science Hero. It is up to you to go into the maddest of situations and get that story before the printers roll tonight. <br/><br/>4) Vigilantes: You are all denizens of a city, doing justice and keeping the streets safe. <br/><br/>5) -Ism's: The 20's was a decade not without its sexism, racism and colonialism and the pulp literature was not without its problems. We could make characters aimed at not only have two-fisted adventures but in confronting some of that shit in some way. <br/><br/>These can be mixed together a bit to taste.  <br/><br/>Thoughts and Vibes?                        </div>

                            I hate reporters. <br/><br/>But, as said, there isn't any reason we all have to be reporters. We'll already be linked together by the Century Club and the fact that we've adventured together. Really, that's all Doc Savage's posse was (once you remove the Doc, that is, because that group is really just supporting NPCs to the uber-protagonist). <br/><br/>Also, while we're talking about the tone of things like going to Mars -- I don't generally like Sci-Fi or Gonzo pulp. I'm much less interested in Flash Gorden or Hollow Earth than in Tarzan or the Shadow.<br/><br/>Right now I have visions of a crusty English professor dancing in my head. Perhaps someone who was in school with the archaeologist and the reporter? We could, at that point, have a team that is all united in being investigators of various sorts, hunters after knowledge lost or forbidden in an endless quest for truth. Lightbringers in an age of secrecy, shadows, and conspiracies.                        </div>

I dig it.<br/><br/>So, what we've got so far.<br/><br/>Some 20's isms, not so far gonzo: boy raised by apes and vigilante using mesmerism to fight crime is fine but a world at the core of our own and raiders from the Planet Mongol is a bit over the line.<br/><br/>I think we are ready to make our PC's up to phase 3 and come back with what we've got.<br/><br/>Alan = Archeologist<br/><br/>Brand = Crusty English Prof<br/><br/>Shreyas = Reporter<br/><br/>Are we cool?  None of the characters are set in stone, so if you want to wiggle or out and out change your concept, say so...<br/><br/>Otherwise, go make your own Investigator into the UNKOWN!                        </div>

<br/>
It seems like you're coming up with a neat central concept here. Morphing the idea of reporters as "lightbringers" (interesting choice of terms there, Brand), to more scholars as lightbringers. Shreyas' character being the one who literally captures the light on film.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any other players? Because what the group needs is the ace pilot and daredevil that takes them to the tombs of the Khmer kings in the jungle to do their digging and such. Oh, and the weird scientist who investigates the super-science phenomena like atomic weaponry. I'm assuming that Brand's character is into the paranormal (has a copy of the Necronomicon stashed somewhere)? Or is he the science guy?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more slot seems open for the skeptic in the group, a rough and tumble Private Investigator. "That Octopus headed guy I beat up? Nah, that was just a mask, doc; you don't think that was real, doya?"<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas.<br/>

<p>So, uh, I'm posting some of my thought process here, since if we were physically present with each other when making characters, this is what I'd be talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong><br/>
Vernon? What's reasonably '20s and doesn't overlap too much with the sound of the other names? Vernon is too much like Jerome. <em>Claude?</em> Yes, Claude is perfect.</p>
<p>Last name? God, I'm baffled. I'm really tempted to buck the pulp custom the book describes and take a real name like Pirbright. Let's set that aside for later.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I</strong><br/>
Maybe he grew up on a farm and went to the city to be a photographer? No, that is way too much like every superhero story you are totally uninterested in. Forget it.</p>
<p>Maybe, um, there was a death in the family? Yeah, the father died, and so Claude got a newspaper job as a way to pitch in with supporting the family, and he worked his way up to be a star photographer by force of (raw animal charm? No, that's not quite right...) <em>dazzling personal magnetism</em> and staggering, unschooled talent alone. Yeah, yeah. I think they could have lived off the family's money, but that wasn't acceptable to him; <em>someone</em> had to be <em>re</em>filling the coffers too.</p>
<p><em>Aspects:</em> Unschooled Talent, My Father's Dead</p>
<p><strong>Phase II</strong><br/>
This phase is so frustrating. I don't <em>care</em> about the war. What if I just went on with Claude's personal story...</p>
<p>So, working just for the paper was just not enough, so Claude maybe indulged some of the interests he had to push away earlier in life, learned a little about anthropology and archaeology, did some art photography...maybe he found a mysterious object in the attic among his father's old things, an amulet? Something made of old enamel and dusty gold...Yeah, and somehow he traces that back to the Century Club, I guess. But no, not among his father's things...maybe it was his <em>mother</em>'s secret, that she was never going to tell him about.</p>
<p>Stunt fodder, being an art photographer means <em>knowing people.</em> Shouldn't Century Club membership come with some of this as part of the deal?</p>
<p>Telling the story about a character's past like this makes me feel like I'm losing the opportunity to use this stuff in play, and ending up with a poorly synthesized and bloated character idea in the process. Anyway, somehow Aspects come out of that.</p>
<p>Okay, there're my thoughts for now. Please feel free to brainstorm at me, gentlemen, while I give my brain a rest. Chargen this heavy really takes it out of me.</p>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Claude is a good name. For the last name though I'd suggest something with a gimmick, pun, or kewl factor attached. So far we've got "Cairo" Hunter (pulp name if ever there was one!) and Jerome (patron saint of Academics) Sage (both a spice that is yummy and another word for learned man). So I think it'd be cool if Claude had the kind of last name that brought him into that trope. Something that acts as a sort of pointer at his shtick or personality template would be cool. <br/><br/>Random suggestions from the hat of my brain: Ashburner, Challenger, Constable, Mercer, McCoy (the real one), Reader, Steele, Stone, Warman, Xander. <br/><br/>As for your phases, they sound pretty good. I like the idea of him being a photographer before he was even out of school because of a family tragedy. If you don't want to over define it because you want to use it in play, then just don't.  "Dad's dead, had to work" doesn't say how or why or what about the dad, just that he died and the death is important to you and your character -- if during we play we want to invent his murder by conspiracy we can. <br/><br/>As for Phase 2 and 3, I'd say don't worry about it so much. I never clearly defined when I joined the Century Club (probably around the time of his work in Persia, through his mentor obviously -- but it isn't explicit and won't be so unless it becomes important in play). You seem to feel like you have to explain point to point how you joined, who you know, how you got to know them... and I don't think you do. You just need a mentor or connection, some cool things that you did, and enough to give you some aspects. I think, really, you've already got enough. Aspects like "Friends and Enemies Among the Gliteratti" to show his knowing people, or "Mother's Secrets" to play off the mysterious family past, are all already imbeded in what you've got. <br/><br/>I think you're making it harder than it should be, cause I think you're already on what you need to have.                        </div>

Aspects: Ultramarine Conspiracy, Damn Nosy Reporters!<br/>
<br/>
I've got a pretty wide range of stunts in mind. Remember when Indy tells the nazi that he'll never find Marcus Brody because Marcus will blend in? I want Cairo to be that guy. Here's stunt ideas so far:<br/>
<br/>
Linguist (Academics)<br/>
Walk the Walk (Contact)<br/>
Tripwire Sensibilities (Burglary)<br/>
Brawling (Fists)<br/>
Contact (Contacting) Regie, bored upper class girl who loves driving, flying, etc.                        </div>

                            Alright, so players are making up characters, what am I doing?<br/><br/>I'm looking at the aspects as they come in, making sure that there are positive aspects that will allow the players to kick butt and have dramatic editing input and negative levers for me to pull on and tug the adventure this way and that.<br/><br/>I'd be thinking about adventure titles to present to the group and once the characters were created I'd present three titles and ask the players to pick on that sounds cool to them.  Then I'd make the idea behind the adventure idea fit the aspects, maybe jotting down some aspects for places, scenes and people with stunts for antagonists and such.<br/><br/>Shreyas is having trouble, seems to be not enjoying chargen one bit and that is rough to see.  Shreyas, what can I do to make this easier for you?<br/><br/>If this were face to face, I'd be supporting him quite a bit more but online, there's only so much I feel like I can do.<br/><br/>And we all have to be comfortable with the idea that this might just be a game that he doesn't like.<br/><br/>But until then, Shreyas, what can I do to help?  How's it going?                        </div>

<p>Judd, this is <em>nothing.</em> I'm pretty happy that my character is shaping up to be someone I can see myself playing. You should have seen me last summer with BW. There was blood <em>everywhere.</em> And a spreadsheet. I still have nightmares.</p>
<p>So, we're doing SotC in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> too and I found that these bits at the end are rather easier, even though stunts leave me with a twinge of disappointment - all my Exalted characters are like in the back of my head saying, "You totally want 20 stunts, not 5..." Guest-starring is pretty awesome. (My guess is that it's just this timeline thing. It imposes a structure that I'm just not used to thinking about... a character is a <em>person</em> to me, not his past.)</p>
<p>So, lessee if i can toss off some guest spots.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sage and the Madness of Lord Curzon</strong></p>
<p><em>Events:</em> Back from the war and only wanting to finish his doctorate work at Oxford, Jerome Sage is drawn into a conspiracy of Lords that threatens to topple democratic England! Cairo Hunter lends his fists to Dr. Sage's battle to save White Hall, and the Doctor's deciphering skills save Cairo's academic reputation. Meanwhile, Claude does his best to destroy his own in his excitement to document an indiscretion...</p>
<p><em>Aspects:</em> Wensleydale's Daughter, No! We Don't Need a Plan!</p>
<p><strong>Cairo Hunter and the Cambridge Crypt!</strong></p>
<p><em>Events:</em> In his last year at Cambridge University, Jack "Cairo" Hunter receives a strange message from his father. Is he really the cause of the mysterious lights in oldest halls of Cambridge university? He prevails on Claude's connections, which doesn't help really, but some time bargaining with a witch doctor leads them to Jerome Sage! Dr. Sage helps uncover the lost floor plans, but is nearly killed in a cave in and only Jackâ€™s help saves him from an untimely grave.</p>
<p><em>Aspects:</em> I'll Trade Anything But The Camera, I Remember Once in the Congo...</p>

                            Fantastic, Shreyas.  Its hard because I also don't know your process.<br/><br/>I have a friend whose M.O. when making up a new character is to tell me over and over that she didn't get the setting.  She'd insist she didn't get it when what I think she meant was she didn't have her handle on it just yet.  Finally, our conversation would trip over something and she'd get it, spouting out an amazing character concept.<br/><br/>But it took a while and could have been seen as pulling teeth if I didn't know that there was a great pay-off coming.<br/><br/>Anyway, more on all of this tomorrow.                        </div>

                            Alright, so at this point I look over the characters and just read 'em over, get a feel for the novels the players made up even more than the Aspects at this point.  I'd e-mail the players three or so ideas for a game and see which the players are interested in, discarding the other two.<br/><br/><b>The Crypts of Camelot</b> <br/><br/>Two archeologists claim to have uncovered the foundation stones for Camelot in the hills outside of London.  Your characters are called in to cover the story, study the ruins and keep England safe from whatever lurks in the crypts under Camelot.<br/><br/><b>Atlantis has Risen</b><br/><br/>The lost continent has risen in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and you three have been chosen as the ambassadors of the Century Club (or Britain) to welcome the Atlanteans to the surface.<br/><br/><b>Howard Carter's Curse</b><br/><br/>Howard Carter's tour with the mummy's tomb he uncovered and removed from Egypt has come to London for its grand opening.<br/><br/><br/>At this point shit's vague.  I haven't linked any bangs to the players' aspects just yet but will do so once they tell me which adventure idea they dig.  <br/><br/>Guys, which one speaks to you?                        </div>

                            So, pretending this is a real game I'm going to go with Camelot and finish my first stage of this thread once I get back home this weekend or early next week.<br/><br/>The first thing I'll do is read over the phases, compile a list of the aspects, all on the same piece of paper and on another piece of paper I'll have the PC's stunts and three highest skills while thinking about how to set up the adventure.<br/><br/>I'm going to meditate on that for a spell.  Usually, this is a fairly fast process, linking the adventure's blurb with the aspects.<br/><br/>So, next up, aspect, stunt and skill inspired bangs, a rough adventure outline and then some discussion, I reckon.<br/><br/>Thanks for your patience.                        </div>
