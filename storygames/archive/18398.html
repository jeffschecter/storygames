Promotion" forum right, and if not, I apologize.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.endtransmissiongames.com/splinter.html" rel="nofollow">S P L I N T E R</a> is a very bizarre RPG that I wrote starting five years ago, and released at I-CON in 2012. "How bizarre?" Very bizarre. What flavor of bizarre? Metatextual musing on topics as diverse as reality television and random generation plus kitchen sink sci-fi fantasy action. Um, squared. If you multiplied Richard Bachman's novel <i>The Running Man</i> and/or Series 7: The Contenders by old school D&amp;D and then multiplied the product by the manga <i>Blame!</i> you'd be partway there<br/><br/><b>That</b> bizarre.<br/><br/>To quote <a href="http://tarotamerican.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/inside-the-s-p-l-i-n-t-e-r/" rel="nofollow">myself</a>:\n<blockquote>In S P L I N T E R you play as a player who is playing a character (called an Avatar, and keep in mind that yes this predates the movie Avatar) in a game. This has probably been done before without my knowledge in the wide world of indie RPG publishing, but not in anything mainstream that I\u2019m aware of. In any case, the game within the game, however, has much higher stakes than the game itself.<br/><br/>In one sense, S P L I N T E R takes place on our very same planet Earth, in the extremely dystopian future of the year 2741. A massive international mega-conglomerate called GamesCorp controls the world, a world which has globalized on an enormous scale. Human civilization is ruled by a corporate board of directors, and instead of the corporate neo-feudalism of Shadowrun and other classic cyberpunk literature, humanity has been forced into a rigid caste system. All who question and resist are dealt with harshly by the Social Police, and might wind up as cybernetically controlled worker drones. The bread and circuses that distracts the masses of the lower castes from the drudgery and oppression of their day to day lives\u2013and the carrot dangled in front of the middle and upper classes\u2013is The Game.<br/><br/>(If this sounds achingly familiar to you so far, there\u2019s good reason. Besides your obvious dystopian inspirations\u2013your 1984, your Farenheit 451, your Brave New World\u2013 this part of the S P L I N T E R setting owes a huge debt to the AMAZING Acts of Caine series of novels by the incomparable Matthew Woodring Stover.)<br/><br/>In a world with countless other games, The Game is the only one that matters\u2013an ultraviolent, cruel, sadistic virtual reality game show which takes place in a seemingly infinite, constantly shifting dungeon-world rendered with over-the-top hyper realism. The Game has many variants, from the short and simple to the lengthy and complex. But even more fascinating than The Game and the world which is it is the cornerstone of society is the world in which the game itself place, known only as the Splinter.</blockquote>\nAs crazy and weird as it sounds, this is a real game, one you can buy, play, or GM for your friends. It's got a five-star rating right now on <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/105066/Splinter" rel="nofollow">DriveThru RPG</a>, where you can get it, along with on <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=18282&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a> and <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/138" rel="nofollow">The Unstore</a>. Any one, really, will enable you to buy it. I am even willing to entertain the idea of giving sending free review copies to reviewers, assuming you have the demonstrable readership to make that worthwhile, and you don't obviously hate me and everything I stand for : P<br/><br/>FWIW I need to disclaim that while S P L I N T E R is a roleplaying game and a game that totally lets you tell lots of stories, it is probably *not* a storygame as I understand the aesthetics of that medium. It's not rules lite, and it has a GM. There are lots of dice and stuff, and sometimes you use them to shoot monsters in the face with a bazooka or something and it matters how far away you are because you might take splash damage, etcetera. It is however, about as "indie" as you can get. As in, I am freezing to death and starving a gutter while I type this through the power of my mind alone because I can't afford an internet connection that isn't powered by my tears. Just kidding. But seriously. But just kidding.

Forgiveness/permission and all that.\n<blockquote>So, hey, here's a question: what does SPLINTER do for me that taking classic D&amp;D, or a D&amp;D retro-clone, and slapping this story about being in the future and in a dungeon game show on top doesn't? I don't ask to be insulting: I'm sure there's stuff, but I want to know what it is.</blockquote>\nTotally fair question, not at all insulted. I'm a bit bushwhacked right now, so this isn't as elaborate an answer as I'd like it to be, but here goes.<br/><br/>Basically, two things...(without focusing specifically on "crunch" or "fluff")--<br/><br/>1) The advantage inherent in the "outer"-setting. This isn't just a dungeon game show, it's one that's the lynch-pin of a world culture more fucked up than that of Brave New World or 1984; a rigid socioeconomic caste system where Administrators literally have more legal rights than Laborers. There are serious thematics at play here, about bread and circuses, about how entertainment anesthetizes the masses while their rights and humanity are surgically removed. It says something about this world that people are willing to risk their lives in the Splinter willingly. Imagine being in the world of 1984 and your only "hoop dream" of fame, comfort, or freedom is plunging yourself into this life-or-death game.  And that's without getting into the weird ass metaplot secrets, like the fact that the "Virtual" world...might not be exactly that, and its interactions with the real world<br/><br/>2) The advantage inherent in the "meta"-setting; the Splinter itself, the Realm. To put it mildly...this ain't your grandaddy's D&amp;D. The dungeon is of infinite size and complexity, and is constantly changing (think Dark City); it is an MC-Escher nightmare megastructure (think the megastructure from the manga Blame!), constantly folding in on itself; none of the tribal civilizations that survive in it have seen the surface or the bottom, and such concepts take on almost religious connotation.  The tech level of the Splinter isn't medieval fantasy; oh, a lot of it is, but you find strata that are steampunk, that are modern tech, that are future tech (lasers and robots), and that are millenia in the future weird science virtually indistinguishable from dark magic and gods. And all of these "strata" through upheaval and constant change are distributed in the most aggressively random, inequitable manner possible, creating real power blocs of haves and have-nots and tremendous inequality (when some guys have plasma carbines and nerve gas grenades and other guys have swords and bows).  Then there's what you're playing, or what your Player is playing, which isn't your typical D&amp;D Warrior-Wizard-Rogue adventurer. Every player's Player's Avatar is a shape-shifting demi-god belonging to one of several immortal bloodlines; and by shape-shifting, I don't mean like "were-rat" or "were-wolf" I mean like "were-golem" or "were-lich". And every Avatar has Harmonics, letting them use "Tuning" to reshape reality (again a la Dark City, like making doors, or treasure, be there when they weren't before). So even without the meta-layer of the real world, Splinter really doesn't much resemble D&amp;D; it plays like D&amp;D, but the setting and the things you play as are *much* weirder.<br/><br/>Hope that helps answer your question. : )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415863/#Comment_415863" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T04:15:48+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  4:15AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds neat!

It's not very robust, which is fine by me, because the real world sessions tend to be primarily about roleplaying and narrative. The real world is very deadly, and when bullets start flying, people start dying at a Realistic rate. Note, I don't mean genre-realistic, I mean grimly, actually realistic. Like, getting shot once with a small-caliber handgun once may very well instantaneously kill you. The genre being emulated here is Dystopian fiction a la <i>1984</i>, so it is really <b>not</b> meant to be empowering and combat should be avoided whenever possible.<br/><br/>Quite the opposite of the Splinter itself:<br/><br/>The "game within the game" is more tactical and crunchy. It uses a d6 dice pool system that functions a little like a hybrid between Shadowrun 3E and Shadowrun 4E. For those not familiar, you roll a dice pool equal to your skill (usually 1-6 for starting characters, skills cap at 12 overall). Count all the dice that come up 4 or higher as successes, so every die is essentially a coin toss (and you could, if you wanted, play with coins instead of dice). The more successes, the better. In combat, you want as many successes as the target's Evasion Factor, which functions roughly similar to Armor Class in D&amp;D. Damage works a lot more like D&amp;D than anything else, i.e. it's measured in points that are expressed as mixed probabilistic and deterministic expressions, i.e. 6d6 + 6, 1d6 + 8, and so on.  The other major thing going on is Tuning Points; Avatars have variable amounts they can use to activate their Harmonics, which are just a bit like Disciplines in oWoD; Harmonics allow you to alter the nature of reality within the Splinter, since every Avatar is a shape-shifting demigod. Tuning Points and Life Points can be regained by resting, although resting is boring to your live-viewing audience and causes Subscriber Point decay. (In Splinter you level up by getting Subscriber Points, essentially by having people Like you on Facebook, or Follow you on Twitter, the 25th century equivalent; the more Subscriber Points your Player has, the better training facilities your Player has access to, and the more powerful your Player's Avatar becomes.) Every combat turn, you get to move once, attack once, and shift forms a limited number of times for free. Depending on how good your Reaction (Initiative) roll is, you might even get to do all of those things more than once. Being an Aventine (Were-Storm Crow) in Splinter is the closest you can get to having Shadowrun-style "wired reflexes" giving you more actions per combat.<br/><br/>Overall, I describe the Splinter's mechanics as "D&amp;D with dice pools" or "D&amp;D by way of simplified Shadowrun". I think that does for a quick overview. As a whole, the game is pretty crunchy by (what I naively imagine are) Story Games' standards. <br/><br/>So please let me know if you have a more specific query about the mechanics! I should be able to answer it, hopefully in 500 words or less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416856/#Comment_416856" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T02:53:13+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  2:53AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I'm understanding, but how is entering the splinter/play that revolves around that anything more than bowing to the beurocratic system as it is?

And I feel bad I didn't see it until more than a year after it was asked. And I don't have a short answer for it, either. I can imagine this coming off as pretentious but: the game is the answer. Or rather, the RPG SPLINTER AS WRITTEN is the QUESTION, and THE WAY YOU PLAY THE RPG SPLINTER is the ANSWER. <br/><br/>It is a world where everyone's agency has been violated and stolen by a virtually omnipotent faceless corporate bureaucracy, one that in the tradition of George Orwell's <i>1984</i> you cannot win against and that cannot lose...nearly the entire action of the game and the narrative revolves around the Splinter itself, the violence and noise and action of which seems like a tangential distraction from the awful state of the world that has no impact on anything real...does it? Does it? Basically I can best state my creative agenda as follows: if you want to really understand this question, you must buy the game. If you want to really get an answer for this question, you must PLAY the game.<br/><br/>Anyway I came back here because we've finally released our very first supplement. It took a while. <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/133397/Splinter-Superstar-Profile--Kade-Merek" rel="nofollow"><b>You can get it HERE</b></a>. An early reader described it as an essential piece of setting information that greatly illuminates the interaction between Earthside and the Realm, and gives gamers a glimpse of what can be expected from a continued SPLINTER campaign. That was flattering to hear but I found myself also really agreeing.
