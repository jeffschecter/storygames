Never heard of that.<br/><br/>Here I've often heard "min rollis". (Stockholm slang is to take a long compound word like "rollperson" ("role person") and truncate it and add -is. Daghem (day home) = "dagis" etc. The -is indicates there's more.) Or "min RP" / "my PC".<br/><br/>Or in English "my char". What are some other words in use?<br/><br/>Drakar &amp; Demoner sucks but I'm very happy with the glossary they created for terms like GM, PC, NPC etc.<br/><br/>SL = spelledare = "play guide" (cognate with "leader")<br/>RP = rollperson = "role person"<br/>SLP = spelledarperson = "person portrayed by the play guide"<br/>etc etc<br/><br/>Oh oh and one more thing: this sort of OP that I just wrote usually suck because while they do tend to get many more participants than normal topics, the participants tend to not talk to each other or even read each other's posts.

Is there bad luck is there something you could give me to fix that?<br/><b>Me (speaking as Sadie): </b>We've got some good luck charms here.<br/><b>Me: </b>She takes a glass pendant that's in the shape of a crystal from behind the desk.<br/><b>Me (speaking as Sadie):</b> These aren't very expensive. I could wrap this up for you if you'd like.<br/><b>GM (speaking as the customer): </b>That would be perfect. <br/><b>Me:</b> Sadie takes out some tissue paper, wraps it up, then puts it in a little brown bag she pulls out from underneath the cash register, and she just hands them the bag.<br/><b>GM:</b> They hand you the money and just clasp the bag to their chest.<br/><b>GM (speaking as the customer):</b> Thank you so much!<br/><b>Me (speaking as Sadie):</b> It's nothing. Any time you need anything we're here. It's what we do.<br/><b>GM (speaking as the customer):</b> Thank you!<br/><b>GM: </b>And then the customer leaves.<br/><b>Me:</b> I want to fade on that scene there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472419/#Comment_472419" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T07:48:31+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  7:48AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Me</b>: I want just this scene of Sadie at home.

I know that the women who objected are feminists on the more extreme end of the movement so it might simply be a fringe thing. Certainly I don't see the use of 'girl' as being meant in an offensive manner in the vast majority of cases where it is used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472446/#Comment_472446" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T14:15:46+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  2:15PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Girl is a weird and loaded term.<br/><br/>Put "girls" into a google image search and see what you get.<br/>then put "boys" into a google image search and compare the results.<br/><br/>Yes, it's commonly used to refer to all women.

But I can't say that for sure.<br/>The whole thing of calling a character "my guy" is super common in video games where you create a character, and are then looking at that character as a tool to play the game instead of a character (which in video games is basically the only method of play available to you, since video games don't have tools for you to shape the narrative and tell the story your way like ttrpg does. <br/><br/>Which isn't to say that there's anything wrong with looking at it in a video game-y way, I mean, don't get me wrong.<br/>I'm not sure if that video game-y observation is necessarily a useful one or not, but it's some food for thought, I suppose.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472497/#Comment_472497" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T21:15:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  9:15PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Maybe then \u201cmy guy\u201d is correlated with <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21094/stance-glossary/p1" rel="nofollow">pawn stance</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472500/#Comment_472500" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T21:30:34+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  9:30PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 9:30PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me:<br/><br/><b>I:</b> When announcing character action.

I also hear it as a bit self-deprecating, as if to say that my character is not so special or important, so I won't bother you with the details of who it is.<br/><br/>Thinking on my own usage, I think the only times I've used terms like "my guy" commonly is when running mini dungeon playtests with a friend, in which case one of us would create a little party of several nameless characters knowing that they would be killed by traps or retired rich within a couple hours.  Then we would talk freely about "Let me get my guys [character sheets]" or "Which one of your dudes has the light?" or "My thief tries the door."<br/><br/>For any ongoing game, I am used to hearing people talk in first person or refer to their character by name.  I don't think I have even encountered "my fighter" or "my dwarf" in a serious game.  For telling a story to someone who wasn't there, I expect to hear first person, "I totally destroyed the gazebo!", maybe with an introduction like, "I play this paladin in Ben's game.

Assume this is within a challenge-based game.<br/><br/>Suppose the GM makes up some challenge for the players to face, such as a dragon with a pile of gold.  But then she doesn't let the players actually face the problem.  Instead, she describes to them how a mysterious archer comes and fells the dragon with a single arrow.<br/><br/>Here, the GM is breaking the rules of the game in order to show off how cool her own NPC is.  If the PCs had killed the dragon within the rules of the game, we would say that they were "winning" in the sense of overcoming a worthy challenge.  But it is meaningless for the GM to overcome the challenge of the dragon because the GM has unlimited narrative power.  So if the GM is focused on making her character "win", that can be harmful to the other players' enjoyment of the game.  It is taking away the players' chance to engage with the challenge.<br/><br/>Now suppose the GM did this over and over, every time the players faced a challenge.  The mysterious archer always shows up and saves the day.  In that case, you would worry the GM was identifying too strongly with the NPC.  She is abdicating her role as the GM, which is to play the whole world and create challenges for the PCs, and instead focusing on showing off this one character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472638/#Comment_472638" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T20:00:19+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  8:00PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2018 8:04PM by Sadurian.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's it in a nutshell. <br/><br/>The 'Mary Sue' NPC is often somehow better than he or she ought to be in the context of the game's setting, a 1st Level Wizard who can cast fireballs to use a pretty crude example. It is not down to the campaign style (such as a Martial Arts campaign where peasants all suddenly turn out to be black-belt martial artists) but simply because the GM loves and identifies with 'his' NPC so much that he wants her to shine brighter than the PCs.<br/><br/>The GM wants the PCs to fawn over this wonderful NPC, but naturally the opposite generally happens. He wants the NPC to be able to overcome the obstacles that the PCs cannot and to avoid harm. That is why I mention 'winning'.<br/><br/>In a more storytelling environment, imagine the NPC that somehow manages to grab the story and make it about them. The NPC that the PCs find themselves having to react to all the time yet no amount of pushing on their part seems to make the NPC react to them. This is the Hollywood hero who is at the centre of everything, comes up with the winning plans and yet manages to emerge both unscathed and in a stronger position at the end of the game. This is the hero that means the PCs are the bit-players and supporting cast and not the ones in the spotlight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472639/#Comment_472639" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T20:31:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  8:31PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that makes sense. <br/>Thank you for explaining. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I just got really tangled up and confused in terms. <br/>I was thinking of "identifying with" in the context of like, caring about the character and what happens to them, and feeling emotional things about them, which imo is necessary for properly acting the role of a character, whereas the way you guys were using it was something different altogether, which is why I got confused.<br/>I'm sorry for the misunderstanding!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472640/#Comment_472640" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T20:48:06+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  8:48PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you, Emma.

I agree that this is usually or likely associated with a game where "pawn stance" may be common. (I don't think I've heard someone say that in reference to a really heavy, emotional, immersive roleplaying experience; the term definitely implies distance to many of us.)<br/><br/>I've never heard anyone say "my girl" (maybe because it sounds like a particular song, movie, or expression, and so doesn't 'ring' right in a roleplaying context).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472645/#Comment_472645" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T21:01:47+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2018 9:02PM by Sadurian.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To my way of thinking, it depends how you think when the NPC is under threat.<br/><br/>Let's imagine a major NPC, Lady Anne. Lady Anne is the centre of a web of diplomacy, treachery and power, and has made enemies. The PCs find work as assassins working for Lady Anne's enemies, and plan their approach.<br/><br/>At this point the way the GM thinks is the difference between an empathic understand of the NPC and identifying too much with it and creating a 'Mary Sue': <br/><br/>Case 1. The GM thinks, 'How can Lady Anne manage to avoid being assassinated.'<br/><br/>Case 2. The GM thinks, 'How can I avoid having Lady Anne assassinated.'<br/><br/>The second case is where my alarm bells would be ringing, where the identification with the NPC goes beyond what is reasonable within the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472647/#Comment_472647" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T21:15:01+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:15PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little confused on the problem with "How can I avoid having Lady Anne assassinated", tbh.

"How can Lady Anne manage to avoid being assassinated?" might involve, for example, her hiring a bodyguard. What if one of the PCs masquerades as a bodyguard for hire? Now we have a plot.<br/><br/>A GM who is thinking "How can I avoid having Lady Anne assassinated?", on the other hand, might think of things like, "If she hires the PC as a bodyguard, that's dangerous. So I'll come up with a reason why she won't do that." That results in a much less interesting game.<br/><br/>But the GM might also conceive of things like, "Well, I suppose she has a network of security, bodyguards, and informants. But, wait! How come we've never heard about them before? I suppose they must be really secretive. Yeah, that's it! There's a whole secret network of spies and guards." <br/><br/>Or, perhaps, even, "Oh, boy, Lady Anne has very few hit points. She could get assassinated easily. Maybe I should reroll them before the next session. And give her some magical protective items, in case any shoots at her."<br/><br/>And all the way to, "Oh, man. I just rolled a 1. That means she gets skewered. I'd better pretend I didn't roll a 1, then!"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472650/#Comment_472650" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T21:26:54+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:26PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2018 9:31PM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess?<br/>I'm not really clear on why the GM is rolling dice for NPCs who the PC's aren't fighting anyways, and why the GM is bothering to have the NPC statted. <br/><br/>Like, the NPC not hiring the PC is suck since then the NPC isn't doing a lot narratively, but like, I don't feel like it's necessarily the GM's job to have the NPC ask to hire the PCs.

That is empathic. <br/><br/>The second case is the NPC being saved by the GM using all the tools at his disposal. That is acting against the game's covenant which states that the GM is the arbiter and not the opponent.<br/><br/>The GM has, after all, all manner of ways to cheat the run of events. Paul_T has mentioned a few of them: lying about dice rolls and presenting or introducing factors that were not present until they were convenient to thwart the assassination.<br/><br/>Imagine a novel in which Lady Anne has just been described as wandering alone in her rose garden. A would-be assassin lines up a crossbow and waits for the perfect moment before send off a bolt that is heading directly for Lady Anne's heart. <br/><br/>In the first Case I presented above, what are the realistic ways that Lady Anne will survive? It has been stated that she is alone, the rose garden has little cover and the assassin has stated that he is waiting for the perfect shot. In that instance I would expect the plot to follow with Lady Anne hit, probably fatally wounded.<br/><br/>In the second Case, the novel might suddenly introduce a hidden armour plate Lady Anne wears in her corset but has never been mentioned before and is not in her description, a herd of cows suddenly appear from nowhere to block her from sight, or she is pushed aside by a bodyguard who has apparently appeared from nowhere.<br/><br/>The second case leaves you feel cheated, it is simply using a god-like <i>deux ex-machina</i>. Yes, the writer/GM can alter things to his own whims, but that doesn't mean it is the 'fair' way to do things. A suspension of disbelief only stretches so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>"My girl" and other names for your PC - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21599/my-girl-and-other-names-for-your-pc/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='"My girl" and other names for your PC - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21599/my-girl-and-other-names-for-your-pc/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Okay, that made it make sense.

The problem with the examples isn't the Mary-Sue-like love for the NPC, it's not following the rules.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I guess?<br/>I'm not really clear on why the GM is rolling dice for NPCs who the PC's aren't fighting anyways, and why the GM is bothering to have the NPC statted. </p></div></blockquote>\nSince we're doing "play to find out" I like <i>everyone</i> statted. In 5e terms I'd just put in "noble" after her name as a shorthand for 2HD, AC 15, +3 to hit etc etc stats. "Assassin" and "guard" and "commoner" have similar default stats available.<br/><br/>The remake of Keep on the Borderlands just came out. It has both the original and a remade 5e version in the same book. People who in the original is listed as "obvious non-combatants" have been statted in 5e. I love that. (It's become so easy to just refer to one of the standard stat blocks. In this case they have 4HP and AC10 and no weapons. But if they end up part of a big mob vs the PCs, or if monsters attack them, it's good to have stats.)<br/><br/>I use a simplified, one-roll-resolves-it rule for NPC vs NPC fights if it happens out of sight. And if it happens in view of the PCs, I give the NPC to the players to roll for.\n<blockquote>Like, the NPC not hiring the PC is suck since then the NPC isn't doing a lot narratively, but like, I don't feel like it's necessarily the GM's job to have the NPC ask to hire the PCs. I feel like realistically the players should decide "Hey, we want a storyline about our characters acting as Lady Anne's bodyguards", so then it happens. </blockquote>\nSee, you're doing story logic again\u2665<br/>We're doing something else (which, in defense of this site's name, will <i>create</i> a story).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472666/#Comment_472666" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T05:05:18+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  5:05AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2018 5:06AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense! <br/>I assumed that with play to find out, you would stat nothing and then pull up stats when a fight starts, or just make something up tbh, but statting everything makes sense.<br/><br/>I'm really bad at not doing story logic!

Some of the NPCs have a more detailed write up or their own stats, own spell selection etc. And others have even less than this guy (there is a place where there are 1d20 number of slaves with <b>commoner</b> stats and a reference to the name list at the beginning of the book \u2014 but who knows, one of them can end up being super pivotal). In Curse of Strahd my players let some goats loose from their paddock and I put them on the encounter table and they always showed up at the most opportune moments.

It's not like Chekhov's gun that itches to get fired, instead the whole <i>house</i> is full of dangerous shit.\n<blockquote>I feel like realistically the players should decide "Hey, we want a storyline about our characters acting as Lady Anne's bodyguards", so then it happens.</blockquote>\nWell, the players set up goals and go for them. And there is opposition on the way \u2014 maybe Lady Anne doesn't trust them?

A would-be assassin lines up a crossbow and waits for the perfect moment before send off a bolt that is heading directly for Lady Anne's heart. <br/><br/>In the first Case I presented above, what are the realistic ways that Lady Anne will survive? It has been stated that she is alone, the rose garden has little cover and the assassin has stated that he is waiting for the perfect shot. In that instance I would expect the plot to follow with Lady Anne hit, probably fatally wounded.<br/><br/>In the second Case, the novel might suddenly introduce a hidden armour plate Lady Anne wears in her corset but has never been mentioned before and is not in her description, a herd of cows suddenly appear from nowhere to block her from sight, or she is pushed aside by a bodyguard who has apparently appeared from nowhere.<br/><br/>The second case leaves you feel cheated, it is simply using a god-like <i>deux ex-machina</i>. Yes, the writer/GM can alter things to his own whims, but that doesn't mean it is the 'fair' way to do things.

It's not very different from almost any other mechanic.

The hero dies and her family members (her sister and some guy\u2026 maybe the SIL?) becomes the new protagonists. Another example is Tolkien's Middle Earth books, changes protagonist between Bilbo and Fellowship \u2014 but I agree that it's moot because I agree that:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And yes, it's a mechanic.</p></div></blockquote>\nAnd I think we both agree that the problem is incoherence between mechanics, rather than any one given mechanic. If people like Plot Armor then they can play with it, w/o including mechanics that stop working when plot armor is in effect.

But maybe I'm misreading. <br/>It definitely gets incoherent if it doesn't specify later what happens when a main character loses a lot of HP, but I'd assume based on those initial rules that it was probably going to clarify later.<br/>So I'm sort of seeing what you mean, I think? <br/>I'm kind of thinking through this as I type. <br/>It's definitely problematic for one participant to lie and say the monsters are failing. But I feel like that would be much more reasonably resolved through something like that a main character just goes unconscious when they hit 0 HP and death mechanics aren't applicable to them? That's what my group and I used to do when we played DnD, since we didn't want PC death on the table. <br/>I didn't realize dramasystem even had combat mechanics. Chuubo's doesn't have them at all. You can just do fighting with the base mechanics, just like how you can do any action with them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473089/#Comment_473089" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T02:53:52+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  2:53AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel like that would be much more reasonably resolved through something like that a main character just goes unconscious when they hit 0 HP and death mechanics aren't applicable to them?</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's sort of what I was going for with "non-lethal consequence" as a resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473094/#Comment_473094" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T04:18:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  4:18AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that makes sense! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21599/my-girl-and-other-names-for-your-pc" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21599/my-girl-and-other-names-for-your-pc" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21599/my-girl-and-other-names-for-your-pc/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21599%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21599%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
