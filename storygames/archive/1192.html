                    I want to talk about IP, the public domain, licenses, and related stuff.  There is definitely a diversity of thought on what constitutes appropriate measures related to the stuff we do.  Everybody has an opinion and many (myself included) feel really strongly that one approach is probably smarter than another.  That's great.  Let's have a rational conversation about it.  I'd love to reach some consensus on best practices - maybe that's possible, maybe not.<br/><br/>So I'm here to learn, and to share what I know.  I'll start the discussion with a question - for those of you (Ben et al) advocating releasing materials directly into the public domain, why do you see this as the best option?  Conversely, what do you see as the perils and disadvantages of a license, particularly the Creative Commons license?  How do these factors change with commercial versus non-commercial work?                </div>

                            If you decide to release your work under a license that allows more than a standard 'all righst reserved' license - and I am big fan of that, although I can understand that there are reasons not to do it - you have several options: public domain, the various CC-licenses, the GNU Free Documentation License, and of course many others.<br/><br/>The most important question when choosing between these options is whether you wish to ensure that derivative works based on yours should be as free as your own. That is: do you want to force people to release their derivative works under as free a license as your own?<br/><br/>If you do not, public domain is a good choice. If you do, the GFDL is a good license, or maybe one of the ShareAlike-versions of the CC-license. The main problem with the CC-licenses are that there are simply too many of them: you <i>cannot</i> combine Attribution-ShareAlike documents with Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike documents and ShareAlike-document, because all of these three demand you to release the result under the license they themselves are licensed under. I consider this a real and grave problem, and the CC-people should either cut down the number of licenses or invent a hierarchy. The GFDL, being widely accepted, might therefore be a better choice.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I can definitely understand people preferring the NonCommercial CC-licenses over the GFDL; I am tempted to use one of them myself. So if it is important to you that (a) people can modify your work as they see fit, but (b) only you can actually sell it and make money out of it, then something like the CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-license is worth considering.                        </div>

                            Victor,<br/><br/>How does the GFDL help here? Surely it's just adding one more incompatible license to the mix.

I'm willing to be corrected here, but I was under the impression that the CC variants were much more widely used outside the FOSS community.<br/><br/>I think the <em>really</em> important thing is that authors make it clear what license their work is being made available under. If you want to release things into the public domain, say so. If I find something on the internet and don't see a license, I'm going to err on the side of caution and assume that I have not been granted any rights other than to view the thing.                        </div>

I think the GFDL is quite widely used; Jason correctly points to the whole wikimedia stuff. But I'm not sure, so if other people are under the impression that the CC-variants are more common, they might be a better option.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that you can publish your work under a disjunctive license: you can tell people that they can choose between license A and licence B, for instance. So you could publish a work under the disjunction of the GFDL and all the CC ShareAlike licenses, in order to ensure maximum compatibility.                        </div>

                            My position is informed by the fact that my free time is at a premium and I have a lot of things on my plate. So when I sit down to design a game, whether as part of an event of not, I want to leave open the possibility of turning my work into a commercial project at some point. So anything that could affect my right to do that needs to be clearly stated, allowing me to evaluate whether it is still worth my time and effort. For example, the Story Names project was a great idea and did not require much time and effort, so I was happy to contribute something under Creative Commons - Attribution - Noncommercial - Sharealike.<br/><br/>Having looked over the Creative Commons site, I could easily see myself releasing any commercial works I create under a Creative Commons license, but I think that generally this choice should be up to the author and not imposed as part of participation in a design contest. The Reverse Engineering Challenge was an exception to this general view, because its very nature has the possiblity of limiting my rights to make later commercial use of any game design.                        </div>

                            It all boils down to intent. Eric's post puts this into clear focus. It depends what you intend to do with your writing.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly recommend (although this is not legal advice) that you release your games under some kind of license even if it's a highly restrictive license. Leaving it in just the normal copyrighted form is asking for trouble given the highly different treatments of game mechanics and ordinary text under copyright law - which is itself, Kreskin predicts, headed for an apocalyptic, insane meltdown when Steamboat Willy hits yet another public domain deadline and Disney bribes Congress to criminalize damn near everything that happens on the Internet.  But that is another story.                        </div>

                            I'm disappointed that no one wanted to address my questions.  <br/><br/>Here's my reasoning for supporting CC sharealike-attribution-noncommercial for group projects and contests.  <br/><br/>1.  There should be a clear standard articulated indicating what the status of a contribution will be.<br/><br/>2.  That standard should be easy to understand and widely accepted.  <br/><br/>3.  It should ensure that a participant/creator's contribution is acknowledged.  <br/><br/>4.  It should should help rather than hinder the dissemination of content and ideas.<br/><br/>5.  It should encourage a culture of altruism.  <br/><br/>I doubt anybody would argue with 1 and 2, even if that standard is "no standard!".  Anybody willing to choose the public domain for 1 is readily sacrificing 3.  4 and 5 may, in some circumstances, conflict.  I'm OK with that, personally, but I can appreciate other views.                        </div>

                            Well, I'll say what I said elsewhere.  The only problem I have with what you're proposing is the '-noncommercial' suffix.  I want people to be able to create systems that incorporate my contributions and make money from it.  Am I correct in understanding that the '-noncommercial' suffix is an explicit prevention of that?<br/><br/>I get and dig your 1-5.  I'm just not sure that allowing someone to make money off my idea prevents any one of those items on your list from happening.                        </div>

                            "It all boils down to intent." is the only conceivable answer to your question.  <br/>
<br/>
Why does someone restrict the commercial uses of their work? Because they do not intend for their work to be used commercially. Why does someone put their work in the public domain? Because they have no intent to restrict further uses of their work.  Why does someone use a Creative Commons license? Because they intend for their work to be used in the ways that license directs that they can.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, also "some people are stupid about licenses" might also be a conceivable answer to your question but I think by the time someone's getting to the point of picking out one license over another they at least have some idea about what they're after.                        </div>

So if something is released under <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a>, you <i>can</i> use it in your commercial game... but you'll need to contact the copyright holders and get their permission.<br/>
<br/>
This gives them the option to say Yes to nice indie game designer, No to creepy indie game designer, and Yes but how about some $ please to deep pocketed non-indie game company.<br/>
<br/>
If you had considered the Public Domain, I think the basic <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Attribution</a> license is better.  It's basically the same as public domain, but your name has to be included in the credits of any games built using your contribution.  Which I think is very reasonable.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stuart Robertson</cite>The nice thing about a CC license is the line that says:<br><br><strong>Any of these conditions can be waived if you get permission from the copyright holder.</strong></br></br></blockquote>
Well, while other licenses may not explicitly state that, it remains true regardless of the license -- a copyright holder is free to put different conditions on different people.  Indeed, there is software that is released both under the GPL and under other licenses -- e.g., Trolltech's QT libraries are available GPL for those who wish to make GPL applications, but are also available under a commercial license for those who don't want to share their code.<br><br>OGL, GPL, etc. and other such "viral" licenses only become "restrictive" (i.e., you can't release using another license) if you don't own the copyright on everything you're passing on.  E.g., if you use parts of the d20 System Reference Document, then your game can only be released OGL (unless you can persuade WotC to let you do otherwise).  But if you simply choose to use the OGL for your own original work, then you're free to license it under other terms as well.
<blockquote>If you had considered the Public Domain, I think the basic Attribution license is better. It's basically the same as public domain, but your name has to be included in the credits of any games built using your contribution. Which I think is very reasonable.</blockquote>
I tend to agree there -- with a true public domain work, people are legally free to, say, simply replace the author's name with their own, thereby claiming authorship.  Indeed, without any solid documentation of when you wrote something, it's possible that someone could take it, replace your name with theirs, and submit it for copyright... then turn around and sue you!  (<i>Unlikely</i>, to be sure, but possible.)<br><br>As a final note, although it hasn't come up in this thread, I'd like to point out that the (in)famous "poor man's copyright" of mailing a copy of your work to yourself in a sealed envelope and leaving it sealed holds no legal weight in the US.  The Post Office doesn't verify the contents of envelopes, or even that they're sealed, so there's no good way to prove that you didn't just mail yourself an unsealed envelope and put something in there at a later date.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I like that idea in principle, Fred, but when it comes time to actually herd cats, treating each person's special snowflake differently is not practical.  For example, the SGNP has 100 sets of lists, by different authors.  I am infinitely glad I said at the outset what license we'd be using.  It cost me Ben's participation, and maybe a few others, but consider the alternative in my time and irritation.                        </div>

                            Jason, <br/><br/>I know you want to hear more from the free rights/public domain end of the spectrum, but here's the nightmare scenario that makes me reluctant to surrender any of my rights as part of a design contest:<br/><br/>1) I create a game in the contest that gets a good response, maybe even wins.<br/>2) Real life intervenes and I take my sweet time beginning further development.<br/>3) In the meantime, someone else takes my game and begins development of their own.<br/>4) I finally begin to start additional development, and then I hear that someone else is releasing a commercial or noncommercial product based on my game design.<br/><br/>If I've given up my rights, then I cannot stop this from happening. And another product based on my game design that was done without asking for my consent (which likely would have been given if I had no plans for further development) has affected my plans for commercial development. My market, however large or small, has likely been reduced. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if I keep all my rights during the design phase, and use a Creative Commons license when I release my game commerically, then I allow others to make derivative products without affecting my initial market because these derivative products will be coming out a while later. The Princes Kingdom likely has little effect on sales of Dogs, but what if PK had been able to come out <i>before</i> Dogs? The picture may have been very different.<br/><br/>So I'm in favor of using something other than full copyright when you release your game, but I am very opposed to doing so as part of a design contest. Fred's suggestion of allowing different people to retain different rights based on their preferences is a good one. Anything else runs the risk of causing train wrecks between people and damaging the community supporting the contest. <br/><br/>Again, I think Story names was a special situation since we were not designing games.                        </div>

<p>My misreading of Fred's suggestion was, "The overarching license is the maximally restrictive license possible, posibly one that disallows sharing." I like this suggestion. Why?</p>
<p>Nothing stops the designer from <em>separately</em> releasing his work in a freer way, but it lifts the contest organiser out of that morass, and furthermore it encourages an atmosphere of communication, which I think is essential - if I want to use your stuff, I'm going to ask you anyway, and it doesn't hurt or insult me that I <em>have</em> to.</p>

                            I'm glad there's some discussion!  Eric, your point illustrates one of the many approaches to content a designer can take - looking at it from the point of view of a market, a potential profit, a product.  Completely legitimate.  Another approach would be to look at it from the point of view of a DIY community of independent publishers, and from that perspective the idea-poacher isn't such a big deal - he'd be reviled and ridiculed and marginalized.  That he made a few bucks at your expense is beside the point - they'd be the last few bucks he'd ever make in this insular sphere.  I'm really hoping to establish best practices that are agreeable to both ends of the spectrum.  <br/><br/>Shreyas, are you agreeing with Fred?  I think you are.  I definitely see the merits of that approach, and I recognize that the SGNP is a unique case.  So maybe I came on a little strong in opposition.                        </div>

<p>You know, every time I read Fred's post I get a different reading out of it! (That's super cool, Fred, I with I could do that. No sarcasm.) Right <em>now,</em> I think I am agreeing with him. Mainly my concerns are twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The organiser of any such group effort needs to be able to handle the IP features of his effort easily and comfortably.</li>
<li>The designers involved need to have flexible options; while I agree with you that idea-poaching is neither kosher nor probably effective in this environment, I still want to offer designers a way to respond to poaching. I also don't want to <em>stop</em> them from doing whatever the crap they like with their own work.</li>

                            So, as of now, Push is operating out of a very different place than the Story Names project.<br/><br/>I don't own the rights to anything in Push aside from my own work.  I've simply licensed the right to publish the work of the contributors and commentators have donated their words/doodles.  No legal stuff of any kind governs this relationship, aside from traditional copyright law, which could spell trouble if Emily suddenly decided she wanted to sue me for the money I've collected so far.  Likewise, while I'm planning to pay Emily her fair share and have made that clear, I'm not currently planning to pay the commentators for volume 1. But I'm publishing their words and making money off them.  Up until this point, this has all been governed by the "Don't Be An Asshole" policy, and seems to be doing fine.  <br/><br/>I would really feel bad if I had to institute some kind of agreement about the legal status of contributions to Push, but that also makes it less comfortable for me to work with people I don't already sorta know and trust, because I don't know whether they'll be an asshole about our "fly by the seat of our pants" methods.  I don't know; to me, not having legally binding contracts is super punk rock.  As long as we can solve things resonably, as human beings, why should we let the Man make us quantify our relationships with each other?  But, yes, there is certainly the potential for this to bite me in the ass somewhere down the road, and that sucks.                        </div>

                            [Edited to remove errors pointed out by JDCorley below]<br/><br/>Creative commons and its relatives are the nice, formal ways of telling people 'this stuff is here for people to use, please use.'  It is a contractual statement, with use constituting implied agreement to its terms.  It's like a permissions agreement you would get from a publisher saying 'you may reuse this material in x place,' except it is pre-emptive.  <br/><br/>You cannot take public domain works and simply attach your name to it.  That is not allowed, it's called plagiarism.  If you are implying authorship of a work you did not author, you are flirting with fraud and its legal kin.  Now, you can release a new edition, call yourself an editor or compiler, etc. and apply for copyright.  But you will not get copyright for the public domain work, only your work.<br/><br/>As for pre-empting someone else's work, well, that is a real sticky thicket of legality.  More likely than not, unless they just blatantly cut and pasted you, you are out of luck.  Using your mechanics, using a setting like one you had envisioned, but with modifications, will not bring down the wrath of the law.  You may be able to bring a case, but unless you have a lot of cash to gain from winning, the cost of pursuing the case will outweigh any gains.  And, of course, that assumes you *win* which is definitely not a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>Which is why I think Jason's CC-centric approach is very sound.  It lets people know that they can re-use the work, but if they expect to turn a profit, they are expected to drop the copyright holder a line and work out a contract.  It also protects those people (like fellow indie gamers) who just want to share some mods of the game with their buds on story games.  <br/><br/>The latter may seem like nothing to worry about, but imagine a case where a well-meaning designer gets burned--they see their work being used without recognition and the person doing it refuses to acknowledge it.  Said designer, frustrated, hires a lawyer and that lawyer convinces the designer to broaden their case to include non-profit infringements.  Sure, you can just stop distributing, but that kind of sucks if you had a wicked cool mod that everyone loved.                        </div>

                            Isbo - you are wrong. If you explicitly put something in the public domain, that is a restriction you must live by.  It is a real legal decision and it is binding.  You can't put something in the public domain, wait until someone produces something based on what you wrote, say "I changed my mind" and hit 'em for copyright infringement.                        </div>

                            Isbo - as JD says, "public domain" is a real legal concept under US law.  However, something only enters the public domain currently either through copyright expiring (which will take a long, long time for anything published now), or by the author explicitly placing it in the public domain.  For more info, see:<br/><br/><a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter8/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter8/index.html</a><br/><br/>As for plagiarism, it is not a crime in the US -- it is considered unethical in academics and journalism, but is not illegal in and of itself.  Copyright violation is, of course, but if you've released your material into the public domain, then you have no copyright to be violated.                        </div>

                            Yes, wrong about public domain--should have fact-checked that (trusted a source I shouldn't have...sigh, me culpa for adding confusion).  Still, want to highlight the important bits that are unaffected by that mistake:<br/><br/>One, claiming authorship can still be problematic for a public domain work.  There is no copyright holder to drag you to court, but I am thinking of this sort of case: I slap my name on Don Quixote and get it picked up by a publisher.  They go about marketing it, distributing it, and what have you.  Ruse is revealed, said publisher takes a beating in sales, book becomes a big financial loss for them.  Because *my* misrepresentation (not to mention probably signing contract claiming I had copyright) leads to loss, they can drag my happy ass to court.  No copyright necessary.  We can imagine less dramatic instances of this.<br/><br/>Two, not using CC-license does not insulate you from having your ideas (mechanics, setting) yanked up by someone else who is just quicker to the punch.  After all, you can't copyright the idea, only the product.  Moreover, with the amount of cash involved in indie games, legal action gets financially risky.<br/><br/>Three, it gives official legal protection to those who use your work in a non-profit context.  As an aside, it only takes a few seconds of cutting and pasting to give them this protection.  The 'I say it is ok' route doesn't prevent me from revoking it at a later date when it has become an important piece of something else.                        </div>

                            I don't know about US copyright law, but here in the Netherlands we have something called "personal rights". It states that, even if you sign away your rights, you still have the right to be acknowledged as the creator of the work. So, if I draw a picture and sign away my copyright, or release it into the public domain, it's illegal for someone else to claim he drew it, or to claim I didn't. Even if I have no copyright, I still drew it, and I'm still entitled to be recognized as such.                        </div>

This is why releasing your idea in a rough form (under CC-Attrib) is a good idea, from where I'm sitting.<br/><br/>Odds are, you're not actually going to develop all of the ideas that you have.  So bang out a quick document about it, blog post it under CC-Attrib (or whathaveyou) and if someone wants to come along and pick up the ball, they can.  The odds your idea being something so totally awesome that someone else will pick it up wholesale and run with it are vanishingly small.<br/><br/>I mean, let's look at the evidence: Has anyone, ever, seen a Game Chef idea taken and published by a third party for profit from under their nose?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Because ideas are a dime a dozen - development is where the beef is at, and folks either don't have the time or inclination to do it.  So protect your idea as being yours by releasing it under CC-Attrib, but there's no need to horde every idea like a precious gemstone.  You'll have another one - and if you're not taking the time to develop this amazingly amazing idea when you have it, maybe it's not as amazingly amazing as you at first believe.                        </div>

<i>I think the only piece left to really be promoted is public domain</i><br/><br/>I clearly have no investment in this, but what good is being a philosopher if you can't take the flip side from time to time?  Perhaps it'll jumpstart someone with more commitment to the idea.<br/><br/>You give a work to public domain because the existence of that public made the work possible in some profound way.  Profound enough that you feel your work is just a contribution to that public rather than your own.  You are saying 'this was not my own, I merely nurtured it, now I return it to the community.'  I can imagine someone who might feel that way about the Indie game community--that the process of playtesting, of criticism, of drawing upon other designer's innovations, leaves the designer with a sense that the game doesn't belong to any one person or even a set of persons.<br/><br/>Alternately, you put the work in the public domain because you trust the public to be a better vehicle for your work's furtherance, that a potential multitude unfettered from the burden of tracking you down for permission, is a more effective agent for your idea's development--a comfort with it being used you might not imagine or be comfortable with, a near Hegelian belief that the 'process' of public absorption will inevitably go the 'right way,' at least in the long run.  Here I have a hard time seeing why you wouldn't just want a more permissive CC license, but maybe you have some hardcore commitments to what the 'public' means.                        </div>

There isn't one, really.  The public domain is (Wikipedia):
<blockquote><cite>Wikipedia</cite>Public domain comprises the body of knowledge and innovation (especially creative works such as writing, art, music, and inventions) in relation to which no person or other legal entity can establish or maintain proprietary interests within a particular legal jurisdiction. This body of information and creativity is considered to be part of a common cultural and intellectual heritage, which, in general, anyone may use or exploit, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes.</blockquote>
Once you've published something under CC-Attrib, you no longer can establish sole proprietary interest over the work, and neither can anyone else.  The only real philisophical difference is the second part: that you feel that your work is simply part of the fabric of the culture and deserves to be returned to that pool of knowledge.  In practice there are things (like mathematical formulas) which aren't even attributable because they're trivially (or wholly) derived.  Game mechanics have been established as being public domain for just this reason.<br/><br/>But the nature of the written RPG (to date) is such that there's always an attributable element to it, making it identical to CC-Attrib in practice.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Absolutely, Nathan - I chickened out at the last minute and went the traditional route witth The Roach, just because I wasn't sure about what I was doing.

It's interesting, the psychological forces at work with copyright and the 'defend first' posture.  I get it too, and I struggle with it constantly.  <br/><br/>But really, has anyone, ever, in the history of gaming, had something stolen out from under them because it was licensed freely?  Even in the hoary old days of GNU and GPL?<br/><br/>I think it's interesting because it says something about the basic insecurities of the creative process: That we've made something but fucked it up somehow.  And that someone else will liekly see the diamond in our rough and make a truckload of scratch off of it.<br/><br/>But it never happens.  Like, ever.  Everyone's too wrapped up in trying to make their own diamonds to go polish up someone else's.                        </div>

                            I think with me it's the spectre of the Siegel and Shuster Effect. <br/><br/>Teenage nerds create comic book character because that's what they're into. Delighted to sell it to a real publisher. Character takes off in a huge way because, well, it was that time in history. Publisher ends up with the rights and screws the creators over in a major way (publishers do that, especially when they're basically built on mob money and trying to become respectable as the authorities were cracking down on their soft porn).<br/><br/>Eventually, grudgingly, the successors to the publishers pay out a relative pittance to a bitter old man who's hardly recognisable as one of the original keen youths.<br/><br/>(With thanks to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Men-Tomorrow-Geek/dp/0465036570/sr=8-34/qid=1156899106/ref=sr_1_34/104-0651983-1595137?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters and the Birth of the Comic Book</a> by Gerard Jones. Incidentally, the company in question is now AOL Time Warner.)<br/><br/>Sure, it'll almost certainly never happen to me. But if I manage my rights well, it will definitely never happen to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, that doesn't answer Jason's question, sorry, ignore me.                        </div>

                            I am not a lawyer.<br/><br/>Siegel and Shuster didn't have the GDL or CC available to them; they sold their creation as work-for-hire.  I think everybody involved in this discussion is at least clear enough on IP not to do that.  (Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins found themselves in a similar situation, but they won--after years of legal wrangling and significant legal costs on both sides.)<br/><br/>In fact, had S and S (or Tycho and Gabe) released their work under the GDL or a CC license--even, say, Attribution-Sharealike--they could not legally have been bought out the same way.  You can sell the rights to something you open-license, but the new rights-holder can't unlicense it.<br/><br/>Toward Jason's question:  the chief reason to release your work into the public domain, rather than under CC-BY, seems to be a grudge against Creative Commons as an entity or philosophy.                        </div>

                            As long as the legal consequences of "losing rights" are being mentioned, I'll go ahead and say this: here in the U.S., the most important (IMO, and I am not a lawer) fact about IP rights (especially IP, in my eight years of second-hand experience obtained by developing software for the practioners of that branch of law) is that if somebody with more money to spend on lawyers than you wants to fight you over your IP, you will most likely lose your IP.  Or maybe you'll win, but become that bitter old man in the years or DECADES it takes you to do so.  It sucks, but it is the way such things work in the courts.  "Interesting" cases only occur when both sides bring roughly the same amount of money (and/or the same willingness to spend) to the dispute.<br/>
<br/>
I say this not to discourage people from doing what they think the "right thing" is regarding their IP, but to remind us all that the right thing can and will run smack into practical reality.  For what it's worth, I'd be (and am) much more concerned about pissing off my friends and colleagues than about the legal "protection" *any* step would grant me, because that protection is always only as good as the lawyers I hire to back it up.  On either side of the coin: I want my work to be "open", someone with a ton of lawyers can always dispute that I had the right to do so; I want to keep my rights, those lawyers can say they were never mine to protect in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Just another angle to keep in mind,<br/>
<br/>
Gordon<br/>
<br/>
PS - Yes, there are cases where the little guys win.  Even cases where they *would* have won "if only" they'd taken some additional step (CC-license, fighting to protect their copyright, whatever).  All I can say is my exposure to the field is that these are a vanishingly small number amongst IP cases in general.                        </div>

                            I'm in strong favour of letting people keep their copyright and making up their mind for themselves. Yes, in community projects that could mean someone doesn't give his permission for a commercial release, or that he doesn't give permission for a free pdf-release for his work. That's a creator exercising his rights, and I think it's important people have the opportunity to do so. The indie rpg community <i>defines</i> itself by creator-ownership. That's what creator-ownership means.<br/><br/>Saying "you can enter the contest, but your work must be under this-or-this license" (or any license at all), to me, doesn't look that much different from "we will publish your comic book, but you must sign your rights away."                        </div>

                            Jasper, I'd frame it as an opt-in mechanism rather than some sort of bullying.  If you are uncomfortable with the license the project creator proposes, no one is requiring you to participate.  My goal here is to find some common ground that is generally acceptable to most people.  Nothing will ever meet the needs of everyone, but as the guy organizing the contest, I want clarity and uniformity first and foremost, so that I know what can and cannot be done with the assembled work.  Nobody is interested in taking away creator ownership.  Nobody is talking about transferring rights.<br/><br/>It broke my heart a little when people started dog-piling the reverse engineering contest threads stating their own pet license, because it means that the final product will probably never be put together as a single work.  Which would have been cool.  Contrast that with the names project, where I, the guy who is putting it together, know exactly what I can and cannot do with every submission.  Is it attributed?  Am I sharing it equally?  Am I not making a profit?  OK, then I can use it  to assemble a fun, useful book, full stop.                        </div>

                            Jason, I see what you mean. But that can be done without a license, by the guy organizing the contest saying "Hey, I'm making a book of this, everyone okay with that?" either before the contest, during or after. Requering any sort of license at all has big consequences for how the work can be used outside the environment of the contest or this community. It's a very real legal decission that gives (part of) control of your work to other people.                        </div>

                            We're agreeing.  What you are suggesting is what Jonathan Walton did with Push and it turned out fine.  It's a viable option, but the cynic in me sees it as fraught with peril.

                            There may be a little detail getting overlooked here: the material under creative commons or public domain is only that material, that collection of text.  If you make significant changes to it, it's all yours again.<br/><br/>I say this because most contest entries, even really cool ones, are not ready-to-sell games.  If (maybe he did for all I know), for example, Jason had submitted the Roach to the Game Chef competition under a CC-style license, that would have no impact on the current, published version of the Roach which is not under CC-license.  <br/><br/>Sure, someone *could* take that and distribute the GC version to their hearts' content, but would you choose it over the version Jason has lavished love and playtesting upon?  In theory, someone could take the copyrighted roach and develop it in a different direction, maintaining many of the rules and themes, without being in violation of Jason's copyright.  It's why TSR couldn't sue the companies that produced the oh-so-many near D&amp;D fantasy games in the 80's.<br/><br/>If it is a matter of developing your ideas better, copyright does not and should not protect you.  Otherwise, copyright would become an obstacle to development rather than a support of it.                        </div>

                            These are the advantages that I can see to releasing into the public domain:<br/><br/>1.  By releasing into the public domain, you give up copyright entirely.  No one owns the copyright to the material... and so no one can, frex, release the material to someone else under a different license.  Everyone has to play by the same rules.<br/><br/>2.  Since the public domain is not a license, there are no worries about the possibility that the license you choose could someday be found legally invalid.<br/><br/>3.  Since you no longer own the material once you release it into the public domain, there is no need for you to associate your name with it.  If you want to release a game anonymously, then, the public domain may be a superior way to go.<br/><br/>... and that's all I can think of.                        </div>

Er, no one can re-license a CC or GDL project either. Not even if the original owner sells the copyright.  Once it's out it's out.  But <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is a fair point.                        </div>
