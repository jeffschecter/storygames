Here's what. <br/><br/>Story game designers create something cool. And, other ones get influenced by that work, and do a variation on it. And this is pretty cool. It's resulted in some astounding games. PTA came from lots of things, Dust Devils among them, I think. Lots of people riffed on Sorcerer or My Life WIth Master. Or Polaris. And those games themselves had influence. TSoY influenced Agon, lots of other stuff like that. Riddle of Steel influenced Nine Worlds. On and on. Dogs in the Vineyard has influenced, like, everyone.<br/><br/>So, now, there are games that are, I dunno, indie grandkids or something that have two or even three indie ancestors innovation-wise. This is also pretty cool. <br/><br/>Here's the weird part: The vast majority of people who are interested in role-playing games haven't even thought about those "old" designs, let alone the newer ones. Which means that those "old" games are still really innovative to a huge range of people. And, of course, the newer ones are too.<br/><br/>For the most part, for totally understandable and good reasons, the "old" games aren't as talked about as much here, for example. We've digested their cool ideas, and are busy making the next round, talking about it, playing those newer games. <br/><br/>But, WOW. If you showed up on day as a guy or gal who liked "story" in your D&amp;D game or whatever, and you found, say, Universalis or The Mountain Witch or something, it'd just blow your mind!<br/><br/>Which means that one strong-point of the creator-owned model is SPEED. We're pretty good at churning out innovative games at a fairly rapid pace. But, the weakness is audience building. We're pretty terrible at growing the audience and getting more people to play these games. <br/><br/>Weird.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92113/#Comment_92113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:02:44+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WHy does this have anything to do with the creator-owned model?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92116/#Comment_92116" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:08:00+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:08AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 9:10AM by Matt Snyder.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't, particularly. <br/><br/>But, I don't recognize a significant number of traditiona (i.e. not creator-owned) games that do the things a significant number of creator owned games do, which is to say deliberately create systems that empower story in that many games do not. For example, Dust Devils is astoundingly different from, say, Deadlands Reloaded or Aces and Eights. Each is a pretty damn interesting game, but the games are very, very different.<br/><br/>Additionally, many, many traditional games include development teams which have different strengths over the historical occurence of "one man band" creator-owned games. They are, for the most part, far less nimble and less able to churn out distinct games as rapidly as the single guy or gal who makes a, say 120 page game or a 48 page game. Part of that is because they spend more time and resources growing audiences with games that don't change, system wise, for several years.<br/><br/>(To clarify: Nothing but history really says that creator ownership must be one or very few people.

Then, assuming the game was successful they do a "revised" edition, rinse and repeat.  With about 5 years between big games or their revisions, well, innovations will obviously come a lot slower, when they come at all.  It's like with genetics, I think: things which reproduce faster evolve faster because there are more mutations happening.  That's probably a really bad analogy, but I don't really care.<br/><br/>My other thought is that (and the people here that are actually making and selling games can correct me if I am wrong) most of the "indie" game designers and publishers aren't in the business primarily to make money, but because they love the games and want to make really cool ones.  Obviously everyone wants to bring in some money, but it doesn't really seem like this is the primary reason to do so.  Am I right?  If I am, well, I've often (at least in my own mind) compared the "indie" rpg "movement" to the modern "Interactive Fiction" (a.k.a. "Text Adventure") community.  For those that aren't aware, there is a decent sized and very active group of people out there that are still making text adventures, or IF as they mostly call it now.  Since no one in their right mind actually believes they can make money from purely text based games any more, these are all free games written by people who just love to write and play them.  Freed from the need to try to make the things commercially viable to a large audience, a lot of modern IF games are really really innovative and do some very fascinating and interesting things.  It seems like something similar is going on with people who are designing "indie" rpgs.  They know it's pretty unlikely that they're going to get rich or find an audience as large as D&amp;D has, so they don't worry about trying to do so and just try to make really cool and interesting games without worrying about being able to hit the mass market with it.<br/><br/>Or something.  How totally wrong am I, here?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>-brian                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92128/#Comment_92128" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:23:22+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 9:23AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Isn't that mostly an issue of how hard it would be to create a truly team-owned product?

I loved Sorcerer, and recommended it to everyone. Then, about a year ago, I realized that I just don't enjoy it as much as I used to, and pretty much never play it nor recommend it anymore. <br/><br/>The reason: There are new games that were inspired by Sorcerer (or born from a similar tradition), that do what *I* was getting out of Sorcerer better than Sorcerer did.  And I'll be straight up, those games are Dust Devils, Spirit of the Century (!!!), and Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>There are even newer games on the horizon, like Inuma and Seiyuu, that look like they will replace Primetime Adventures or other games on my shelf, as they do that those New Games did for me, but again *better*.<br/><br/>It's awesome seeing this happen in real time and being a part of it. It's also kinda weird, like if I wasn't as much into RPGs as I was, didn't join RPGNet back in 1999 when I was bored in Japan, I would have missed all of this. All Of It.

I don't think RPG companies have a system quite like that. Sure, WotC, White Wolf and other companies no doubt have a schedule for the first X supplements of a new project, but its not to the extent that they know in Y years they'll put out the revised decision.  Those decisions are more based on sales from the existing titles, as well as a variety of other factors. Many, especially after they've been established, probably anticipate doing a new version at some point, particularly after a first edition.<br/><br/>As for making money.  I doubt anyone is involved in RPGs professionally who is interested in making money (outside of support staff: like lawyers and receptionists).  I think the difference between an indie developer and someone working for an RPG company is a mix of luck and interest. If anyone, ANYONE, is working in the RPG hobby/industry because they are more interested in making money than they are in making games they've made an absolutely terrible life decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Yes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, but what you'll always end up with is just another car, or at least something centered around a wheel. A bike maybe. Starting from scratch doesn't confine you to the wheel at all.
