It's called <em>Becoming Heroes</em>, and is a game about heroic fantasy. It has a lot of influences, both from other games and various stories, but I think that the single best model for the sort of story it's aimed at is Garth Nix's <em>Abhorsen</em> series.<br/><br/>If you're interested, check it out <a href="http://games.transneptune.net/becoming-heroes" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The PDF-only option will be available soon, but you can get the hardcopy now, and you get a PDF with that, just contact us.<br/><br/>Thanks, and I hope you enjoy it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335587/#Comment_335587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T20:12:09+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  8:12PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi.

I'm John LeBoeuf-Little, and I co-wrote (with Kit and Austin) Becoming Heroes.<br/><br/>To answer your question about setting, Becoming Heroes has no setting of its own. But it does have a genre: epic fantasy. That is, if you want to play in a typical high-fantasy sword and sorcery setting, by all means do so. Our most recent game has been sci-fi (a subset of fantasy, in our opinion), with a omniscient hive-mind hounding us while we have epic space battles. We've also had fun with a classic D&amp;D setting, and separately, a typical Edo Japanese world. We talk for a bit in the book on how to pick a setting that'll work and what the essential properties are for epic fantasy (in our mind.)<br/><br/>For mechanics, you define traits about a character, and use those traits during conflicts to do things. Those traits could be anything from who you are, to how you got that way, to why you do what you do. By using these traits, you build up a die pool which is rolled at the end of a conflict. If you roll better than the GM, you win. There's some nuance to all that to keep it interesting - even if you lose, you still get something out of the conflict, and the results can give you new traits to use later.<br/><br/>The last bit is with virtues and arcs, and it's how we try to make each player feel like the main character of the story. It gets a bit detailed but you have these beads which represent your fate - destiny and doom, they're called. These beads are used to fuel threas (which are meta-story effects) or just do game-breaking things during a conflict. Arcs are more like patterns for heroes. You might be a Lost King (Aragorn), while I'm the Dutybound (Frodo). Neither is particularly better, but their stories are different. You get benefits for following your story, including new threads, or more beads.<br/><br/>If you want, I can elaborate on any of that, but figured you might be more in for an overview than a thesis. Anyway, I hope that's not too much babbling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335612/#Comment_335612" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T01:45:30+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  1:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds pretty clear as far as what was said.

You just pile up the dice, then roll them at the end of the conflict, then sum the result. Ties get broken by the player. <br/><br/>For character creation, there're a few parts. One part is, you pick a bunch of traits at character creation. Eight are primary traits (descriptors of your character) while three are ties (people you care about) and three others are circumstances (starting situations your character is in.) Another part is picking your virtue (which determines when you get beads of destiny/doom) and yet another is picking your arc. Only one person at a table should have any given arc, which helps with that "feeling like a main character" thing. Oh, and threads, which I talked about before. You get four, and some are more powerful than others (based on how many beads they take to activate).<br/><br/>So, as an example, everyone would sit down, and you'd all agree on what setting you want to play. You'd all talk about which arcs you want to see. (We also have suggestions on which arcs go well with which settings in the book.) You'd work out if there's magic or psionics and what its limitations are, if any, and how you'd want, as a group, to see it come into play. (In Lord of the Rings, Gandalf casts a number of spells, but none are the flamboyant evocations you'd see in Dungeons and Dragons.) And once you do all that, each player creates all their traits, and chooses threads they think will work out for them. <br/><br/>Of particular note would be ties - there's no formal system for making players share ties, but every group we've played with has ended up where some of the players share a tie or two with another player. And ties are used like any other trait, when the tie itself is relevant to the scene: maybe you're fighting a dragon who has captured a family member, so the conflict is more important to you (and as is typical of epic fantasy, that gives you an edge).<br/><br/>Hopefully I've done an okay summary of the book - for all that it feels like a small book, it's still ~120 pages or so, so obviously I'm leaving out some nuance. Any other questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335733/#Comment_335733" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T22:49:16+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 10:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case it helps, there's a character sheet here: <a href="http://games.transneptune.net/files/2011/07/Becoming-Heroes-sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.transneptune.net/files/2011/07/Becoming-Heroes-sheet.pdf</a><br/><br/>This might help clarify some of the terms I've been using and how a character fits together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335736/#Comment_335736" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T23:02:01+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 11:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.  Condensing this for my RPG Encyclopedia, I put down: <br/><br/>A role-playing game designed for the genre of epic fantasy, with<br/>story-oriented mechanics.  It uses freeform traits, which add to<br/>make a d6 dice pool used to resolve conflicts.  In addition to determining<br/>success, players may still gain things if they lose a conflict and/or<br/>may get new traits to use later.  Players also have beads for "destiny"<br/>and "doom".  These are used to fuel threads (meta-story effects) or<br/>to modify conflicts.  The character has an "arc" like Lost King for<br/>Aragorn or Dutybound for Frodo.  If a player follows their arc, they gain<br/>benefits including new threads or more beads.  Character creation is<br/>by picking 8 primary traits (descriptors of the character), 3 ties<br/>(relationships to other people), 3 circumstances (starting situations<br/>the character is in), 1 virtue (determining when to get beads of<br/>destiny/doom), 1 arc and 4 threads.<br/><br/>Is that OK?  It's a dry description, but that's the nature of my <br/>encyclopedia entries which try to be neutral/factual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335738/#Comment_335738" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T23:08:43+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 11:08PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty awesome, actually. :P<br/><br/>And thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335809/#Comment_335809" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T16:57:29+00:00" title="July 23, 2011  4:57PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to have bought your game on PDF as I own an iPad and I 'm done with print.
