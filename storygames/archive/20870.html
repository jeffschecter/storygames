I've kept it generic, but would add flavor to suit the genre. Looking for some feedback on how it reads and the overall design.</i><br/><br/>Every character comes with seven attributes. There are three scores, three saves, and one lucky number. Roll 3d6 seven times and then decide on where to put each result. Higher numbers are better for your scores, while lower numbers are better for your saves. For your lucky number, use personal preference. <br/><br/>Your rolls will help you to choose a class. In this game, your class is a combination of background and skills. You'll begin play at level one. Your level is how experienced and talented you are in your class. If using your class, an attempt will always succeed--unless difficulty or opponent is above your level.<br/><br/>Whenever you attempt to overcome an opponent, obstacle, or dilemma, you'll need to use one of your scores and roll a d20. If the result is equal or below your score, you have succeeded. Rolling your exact score is a critical success. If you attempt an action outside of your class or the difficulty is greater than your level, this number becomes the chance of critical failure.<br/><br/>Use CONFRONT when facing another opponent in a non-lethal situation. Use AVOID when trying to get past a physical or non-physical obstacle. Use SOLVE when confronted by a dilemma.<br/><br/>Sometimes in the game you will find yourself in danger. When this occurs you'll need to make a save. Roll a d20 and if the result is higher than your save number, you have succeeded. If the difficulty or opponent's level is higher than yours, then the difference is added to the save, making it harder to succeed. <br/><br/>Save with COOL when responding under pressure. Save with GRIT when faced with adversity. Save with QUICK when reacting on impulse.<br/><br/>Sample Character<br/><br/>Name: Felix "the Cat"<br/>Class (level): Cutpurse (2)<br/>Scores: Confront (12) Avoid (15) Solve (14)<br/>Saves: Cool (8) Grit (11) Quick (10)<br/>Lucky Number: (7)<br/><br/>Let's say Felix is attempting to break into a safe. The difficulty for the safe is a 7. If the difficulty is 2 or less, the attempt automatically succeeds. Since this is not the case, the difference is 5 and becomes the risk factor for the cracking the safe. <br/><br/>He will use his AVOID score of 15 to try to crack the safe (since it is considered an obstacle). Felix needs to roll 6-15 to be successful. A roll of 15 is a critical success. A roll of 16-20 the attempt fails, but nothing bad happens. A roll of 1-5 is a critical failure.<br/><br/>Felix rolls a 2 and his attempt at cracking the safe fails badly. Not only does the safe not open, but the three guards in the next room overhear him and give chase. Felix manages to get outside and looks for a way to escape.If Felix's level is higher than the guards, then automatically escapes (at least for a while).<br/><br/>If the level of any of the guards is equal or higher than the thief, then Felix has to make a save roll and the difference in level is added to the score. One of the guards is level 1 and soon gives up the chase. However, the second guard is level 3, and the third is level 4. Take the highest difference, guard (4) versus cutpurse (2) and add that number (2) to the save.<br/><br/>Felix makes COOL save as he is attempts to escape. He has an 8, along with difference in level makes his save number a 10. Felix will need to roll an 11 or higher, or else be caught.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that you can, once per session, switch out a die roll and replace with your lucky number. It can be switched for either a score or save. In this example, Felix's lucky number is 7. If he had decided to use his lucky number when attempting to break into the safe, the roll of 2 would have been switched to 7 and the safe would have been cracked instead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brunobord" title="brunobord"><img alt="brunobord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/nF7O8NB7A2O3Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brunobord">brunobord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458105/#Comment_458105" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T22:25:18+00:00" title="November 15, 2016 10:25PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks pretty cool.

Dilemmas are made from choices which can cause consequences. For example, playing Blackjack and choosing whether to stand or hit is a dilemma. <br/><br/>I see scores more as character ability in response to a situation. Confronting an opponent can be very different from say a fighter to a cleric. Also how they surmount obstacles and solve dilemmas as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458107/#Comment_458107" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T22:56:33+00:00" title="November 15, 2016 10:56PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could also change Solve to Resolve and that might make it more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458110/#Comment_458110" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T23:59:32+00:00" title="November 15, 2016 11:59PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a pretty old-school design, and, in that sense, doesn't excite me.<br/><br/>However, one neat feature is that some scores are good when they're high, and others are good when they're low (saves).

All PCs draw dice from the same big pool. When you fail, the problem is you've wasted time and resources - you've used up a d20 - without accomplishing anything! Class and level become crucial: the core winning strategy is divvying up tasks between PCs so that as much as possible can be accomplished without rolling. Critical failures typically breed situations where you have to make saving throws, potentially using up more dice from the pool! Maybe, those rare lucky "critical successes" add dice to the pool (these represent doing things super-quickly, conserving resources or finding new useful resources on the field) adding a little extra incentive to the gamble of a roll.\n<blockquote>Keep in mind that you can, once per session, switch out a die roll and replace with your lucky number. It can be switched for either a score or save. In this example, Felix's lucky number is 7. If he had decided to use his lucky number when attempting to break into the safe, the roll of 2 would have been switched to 7 and the safe would have been cracked instead.</blockquote>\nThe switch is permanent, isn't it? After doing this, Felix's lucky number changes to "2"... Better use that up on a save next session!<br/>I like it that, this way, you can end up with some hard-to-use lucky number, which adds extra weight to the choice of whether to switch a failure for a success, depending on your exact roll.<br/>If this was a game about criminals and heists, I'd use their current, final lucky number as a measure of their future luck (how happy of a happy ending they get) when a PC finally chooses to retire - maybe a <i>Fiasco</i>-like table (but happier!) or a roll under (above?) your current lucky number mechanic or such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458128/#Comment_458128" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T14:59:47+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  2:59PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's good, Rafu!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458132/#Comment_458132" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T15:53:25+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  3:53PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a><br/><br/>All criticism is welcomed.

These change over the course of combat depending on how successful you are and how long the fight lasts. How much armor you are carrying and the weight of your weapon, while offering more protection and dealing more damage, burns through your effort faster.<br/><br/>You can attempt a number of different maneuvers, more complex maneuvers require more energy pull off and with some of the more difficult maneuvers, a failed attempt could result in leaving you tired, demoralized, or exposed.<br/><br/>The goal is to gain an advantage on your enemy through a series of maneuvers and deliver killing blows.<br/><br/>I could keep it as one score HP, which takes into account morale, effort, and adrenaline. Though I like the idea that each maneuver requires effort. Hitting or missing effects morale, and burning adrenaline can help you in the short term, but hurt in the long run. <br/><br/>Perhaps your effort points can be used first before having to dip into the d20 pool. <br/><br/>Now a couple things can come into play if you go with the pool. One, you'll want to get the fight over ASAP. The longer it goes the more dangerous it gets not just for you, but the whole party. Two, if you drain the pool and you still need to check a box. You could take it from fatigue, stress, or even pain.<br/><br/>Things to think about for sure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458164/#Comment_458164" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T17:24:13+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  5:24PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way you could simplify the system is to make "checking boxes" based on the character's circumstances.<br/><br/>For instance, maybe if I am unarmoured, I can check off "stress" and refill my d20 pool.

But do like the idea of tactical maneuvers. So maybe mixing all three somehow could work.<br/><br/>Let's say you keep the same rule in that you will always succeed in hitting if you are equal in level. If your opponent(s) is lower level you get extra hits equal to the difference. So, you are level 3. You are fighting three level 1 Gobins. You automatically hit the first one. With the difference of 2, you also succeed in hitting two more times. You can use those hits on a single opponent or multiple opponents.<br/><br/>This would work well in mowing thru mooks. Also there is no need to dip into the d20 pool.<br/><br/>Now lets assume you are facing off against two Bugbears who are level 5. You've got to roll to hit and you've got to exert and pull from the pool. Exerting not only costs the d20, but also stamina as well. I'd like to somehow get morale and adrenaline into the mix as well.<br/><br/>I like this. The party would have to be very clever in its approach. Do you have enough in the pool for everyone?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458174/#Comment_458174" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T21:22:44+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  9:22PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The original idea came from fantasy wilderness survival, where resources are scarce and valuable.<br/><br/>If I went with the d20 pool, how do you determine the starting number of dice? What happens went it goes empty?I've got a set of conditions, things like: Thirst, Hunger, Fatigue, Exposure, Filth, Pain--each with three boxes. If any of them get to the third box, you're out. So perhaps to refill the pool, you've got to check one of the boxes (depending on the situation).<br/></blockquote>\nWith the d20 pool idea, I was thinking of a heist/crime game, where nonlethal failure is an option: exhaust your collective pool and you have to give up - you don't get the money or whatever it was.<br/>Unless giving up on your exploration and going back to the starting point is an option, I would handle wilderness survival differently.<br/><br/>When you say "fantasy wilderness survival", I imagine an adventure is essentially a string of trials you have to endure - a sequence of saves. Pass all of those saves and you've made it through the journey, but for each failed save there are dire consequences: you lose an essential part of your PC  (a heirloom item, a limb, a piece of your sanity, dignity) or maybe you lose your PC outright, depending on how you want to pace the game.<br/>In these context, confront/avoid/solve rolls represent optional, voluntary actions a PC undertakes between prescribed saves, when presented with an opportunity, in order to gather additional resources in the wild. "Just failing" here is a viable outcome: it represents a wasted opportunity (no retries).<br/>PCs begin their journey with very limited resources, representing their gear and maybe some knowledge of what lies ahead. Each piece of resources is a concretely defined item or fact, not just an abstraction like in my dice pool idea. Resources are spent on saves, to improve your chance of success or grant you automatic success, instead of or in addition to your class level - did I mention you <i>really</i> don't want to fail any saves?<br/>The only way to gather more resources in the wild is to succeed at the optional confront/avoid/solve rolls, but in case of a critical failure you end up in some dangerous situation and have to pass an extra save - above and beyond what's required to complete the journey - potentially using up resources instead of gaining any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458193/#Comment_458193" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T22:31:57+00:00" title="November 18, 2016 10:31PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu:  In the latter case, you wouldn't need the pool of d20s correct?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458195/#Comment_458195" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-19T00:25:21+00:00" title="November 19, 2016 12:25AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Correct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458210/#Comment_458210" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-20T02:09:03+00:00" title="November 20, 2016  2:09AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That also sounds exactly like <a href="/forums/profile/bendutter%27s">@bendutter's</a> game, Perseverant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458215/#Comment_458215" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-20T03:06:53+00:00" title="November 20, 2016  3:06AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, pretty close.
