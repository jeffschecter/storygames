Most of the games I've ever played (save Dead Inside, possibly) were focused on conflict (and even Dead Inside used conflict to achieve its goals). And most the games I've ever heard of (save Breaking the Ice, from what I have heard/read) are conflict-oriented and focused.<br/><br/>Enter my next goal: I want to design a game that exists without conflict, or where conflict is entirely perpendicular to what the game is about. This is a game where there are no bad guys, where all parts of the story are improvements upon the last bits, and where it is possible to make the world a better place and become a happier person as a result.<br/><br/>I'm currently unsure whether such a project will "work out", or if I'd play the end result, but I think it's a cool exercise and I'd like y'all to come along with me for a ride.<br/><br/>Here's the things I want to use this thread for:<br/>1.) Talking about the idea of a conflict-free game.<br/>2.) People throwing out suggestions on how to set-up such a game, in terms of colour, mechanics, premise, etc (a la the Awesome-ify threads, except starting with a concept instead of a product). Ideas need not build on each other, but they can.<br/>3.) I want to take from this thread a core idea to start building a game about "conflict-free resolution" around.<br/><br/>That said, here's my first contribution:<br/><br/>An apocalypse almost happens. Or maybe it does, but there are survivors. And it's enough to make the survivors/witnesses/participants realize "wow, we need to change things. Now." The game starts by defining a Brink, a situation that led to this Brink, and the realization that the Course needed to be changed. From this point, play starts. Play is focused on consensus-based resolution, and seeks to improve the situation. Players continue to build a Framework, and then frame scenes where they play moments of hope and achievement for this stage of the Framework.<br/><br/><i>Ex. In a fantasy world, almost all the world's magical power, essence, was depleted. Mages had fought out endless battles in the dreamscape, and warriors had coated their weapons in essence-taint. War almost drained the wonder and magic from the world. Now things have changed - a group of powerful mages, known as the Coalition, have managed to protect a small seed of essence from  the destruction and the draining. And now they seek to relight the world's essence wells.<br/><br/>The players decide that the first piece of the framework is gaining powerful allies. The players all take turns narrating into existance a Turning Point scene, where this Framework is partially realized. Once all players have narrated and played out such a scene, the next stage of the Framework is established.</i><br/><br/>Potential for this game:<br/>a.) It could be an exercise in utopia-creation.<br/>b.) It could be a world-building exercise for another game campaign that later followed.<br/>c.) It could be an exercise in dystopia-creation, if players chose to introduce subversively-negative Framework stages like "eliminate all difference".<br/>d.) It could be an exercise in "what would you do to change the world" kind of thinking.<br/><br/>Of those possibilities, I'm juiced on all of them, really.<br/><br/><br/>So, that's my first idea on the subject. Do you have any?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59481/#Comment_59481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T01:48:53+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  1:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Enter my next goal: I want to design a game that exists without conflict, or where conflict is entirely perpendicular to what the game is about.

There's always going to be something that some nitpicky person will identify (correctly) as conflict, whether it be between characters in the fiction or between players in the game. But a game with mechanics and a system that provide traction to other things, leaving conflict to sink or swim as players desire, seems like a worthy goal.<br/><br/>I can already think of some games that may fit the bill, and I bet other people who know more than me will think of others.<br/><br/><a href="http://kallistipress.com/?q=node/3" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Horizon</a> is the first game that comes to mind, as far as games that are not <i>about</i> conflict. While there is competition and players take on roles that may conceivably be in conflict with each other in the fiction, the game is really about describing the New World and exploring the interaction between its various elements and the 'roles'. The mechanics are competitive and do not require consensus, but they do support collaboration and compromise, which seem about as good as consensus to me. Certainly there is nothing stopping a group from playing a game of Conquer the Horizon in which all conflicts are overcome -- I'd say that's the default mode, in fact, with all the competition happening between players as far as whose contributions to the fiction will have the most impact. <br/><br/>I'm curious what happens if we apply this lens to a game like Bacchanal, which in some more important sense does seem to be focused on conflict between different elements within the narrative (as represented by their various dice), but not necessarily between characters or any of the normal agents we expect to take sides on things. On the other hand I am not sure if the point of the game is to focus on those conflicts, or if those conflicts exist only to provide variety that helps players focus the game on... something else. On poetic or sensual narration, or on comments about desire and death. Of course using this method it is easy to say that lots of "face-stabby" games are not 'about' conflict, so maybe it makes more sense to restate the goal as creating a game that does not <i>require</i> conflict to achieve its goals, but may incidentally include some conflict. On that count I don't think Bacchanal qualifies, but really I've only read the game so what do I know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59487/#Comment_59487" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T02:08:54+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  2:08AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Competition' and 'conflict' are simply playing around with semantics.  You compete with someone who has similar goals to your own, where the end result of achieving these goals is non-optimal for both of you.  If the results are optimal for both of you, then you're not competing, you're cooperating.<br/><br/>As far as a conflict-free game ... once you've eliminated all conflict from a game, it ceases to be a game at all, and becomes a shared activity.  There has to be grist for the mill, i.e. some sort of tension, be it between the players or between the players and the rules structure, for it to be a game.<br/><br/>Even if you have a situation where everyone's contributions to the game are holy writ and nothing can be altered, any addition has opportunity to stunt the growth or trajectory of another player's additions or ambitions.

They certainly don't really address how to approach your premise.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think a dialogical or conversational structure would serve you pretty well.  Say, like the resolution system of <i>Polaris</i> without the stats and die rolls.  I've worked a few games that steal from Ben's basic premise of negotiated player declarations (which is also the basis of James Wallis' <i>Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i>).  That seems like what you're getting at here.  One player could say, "Okay, we're going to turn the oceans into loganberry jam."  And then other place could narrate the consequences of that or other changes, and verbal cue could tell players to record certain things or make certain choices, etc.<br/><br/>If you want to talk more about that kind of play, cool, but I think it's just a specific and more-trailblazed approach to designing games that are not really about conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59584/#Comment_59584" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T09:07:17+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  9:07AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Tony said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how is what you propose in the first post, not a central conflict?

And then other place could narrate the consequences of that or other changes, and verbal cue could tell players to record certain things or make certain choices, etc.</blockquote>\nJonathan, that's an awesome idea. I think that if Polaris stories didn't explicitly include "...and then you all die in vain, nice job losers" that they'd fit my bill, to a large degree. Well, except for the conflict resolution rolls.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to figure out a way to involve more consensus-based resolution, rather than Polaris' more barter-based resolution (as I see it, at least).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59633/#Comment_59633" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T11:17:17+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 11:17AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Enter my next goal: I want to design a game that exists without conflict, or where conflict is entirely perpendicular to what the game is about. This is a game where there are no bad guys, where all parts of the story are improvements upon the last bits, and where it is possible to make the world a better place and become a happier person as a result.</blockquote>\nYou know, if you drop the "where it is possible to make the world a better place and become a happier person as a result," you've got a good fit with your typical "Slacker" game: the game where big conflicts may exist but the PCs explicitly do not care about them.  I'm thinking something like that Catch-22-esque goldbricking-supersoldiers-in-WW2 game that JDCorley mentioned a while back.  Sure, the war is on and your country wants you to go punch Nazis and fry them with your laser beam eyes, but you know it's way more fun to forge the CO's name on a three-day pass and spend it all gloriously drunk on wine with a couple of hot English chicks in a swanky hotel.  Even just hanging out and shooting the shit with your squad back in the barracks is more fun than risking life and limb in defense of liberty.  Any big important conflict (winning the war!) becomes a smaller, less critical conflict (avoiding responsibility!), and it's more or less a given that as long as everyone's having fun avoiding responsibility, they will continue to avoid it, which makes the smaller conflict a moot point.<br/><br/>Although except for staying true to the '90s-era cynicism of something like "Clerks," I'm not <i>entirely</i> convinced that a slacker game can't be about the world becoming a better place and the PCs becoming happier people...I'm just not sure how you'd go about it.  Jonathan Walton's mention of "negotiated player declarations" sounds good (though obviously it requires players who enjoy that kind of structure, which would preclude it from ever getting anywhere with my gaming group).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59642/#Comment_59642" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T11:38:17+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 11:38AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, are you aware that there are various formal systems that have been developed for making decisions by consensus? We used several in the co-op system at my college and various intentional communities (communes and the like) have developed many others over the years, as have people working in small-group communications for the business world.  Wikipedia actually has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making" rel="nofollow">a fairly good article</a> that explains some of the basic ideas and it has an extensive bibliography that you might want to check out.
