A smart read, it is.<br/><br/>This morning, I recalled a sequence some like this, in some of my games:\n<blockquote>GM: The barkeeper looks at you suspiciously. "We don't talk to cops like you!"<br/>Player: I jump up on top of the bar. "Are you kidding me? I'm exactly the kind of cop you'd best listen to, dude!!"<br/>GM: Okay, so I think we're in a conflict, let me roll out my fancy chart of narrativist conflict resolution and start declaring stakes and twiddlying widgets.</blockquote>\nAnd wow, that technique isn't just clumsy (though it is). It's actually something of a <i>blocking</i> move by the GM there. The player has pushed forward something - an action has taken place in his fiction, and it's presumed there's some reasonable outcomes attached ("they gasp and step back" vs "they appear disinterested"), and what the GM then does it say, hold it: you've narrated something, now let me throw a boundary over it and let's questionify it and decide whether you really meant what you did there.<br/><br/>I'm not criticizing staking technique, but I think a clumsy technique with which it may be applied.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> the right move here, ideally, is to take that player's input - accept some defeat, in fact - and build on top of that. If I wanted a conflict, it has to be out there without rephrasing/reversing what's already out there. So perhaps the GM should accept the contribution here - the barkeeper is stunned and stammering on the floor, but he's also looking for his secret alarm button as he start babbling, and now the GM and proactively offer a different conflict than before: does the player keep control of this situation?<br/><br/>(And I think this all makes sense with reversing the player/GM roles, or with players-not-GMs involved.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126251/#Comment_126251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T12:16:38+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 12:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is totally true.  <br/><br/>I know as a GM I try to let these moments play out, and then switch gears to interface with dice/cards/whatever when it feels right, when the dramatic moment has been played out or the situation demands resolution.

I can totally remember instances of that happening at SGBoston, Dev, especially when we're playing new games.  Like, it happened a couple weeks ago when I ran In A Wicked Age for the first time.  When do you stop talking and move to rolling dice?  How does that transition happen in a way that seems to encourage the interaction and banter to continue without shutting it down?  With games like Dogs, you can generally reach for the dice fairly quickly, because the dice provide structure to contentious interactions, but IAWA is somewhat different.  And non-Vincent games are often even more different.  This is all IIEE stuff, sorta, yeah?  Or a slightly different thing than IIEE, but closely related.  This isn't about how material makes it into the fiction so much.  This is about when the mechanics engage with the fiction and what that means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126364/#Comment_126364" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T23:06:32+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 11:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2008 11:09PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to start a conversation about this on the Forge a few months ago, but it didn't get very far:*<br/><br/>There is definitely a continuum or scale for where and when conflict resolution mechanics are called upon within a "free play" situation. We have terms for IIEE, Fortune-at-the-X, but I haven't heard anyone try to dismantle this one yet. You're right that it's sorta IIEE and yet not quite.<br/><br/>For instance, consider:<br/><br/>A--Free play. Some characters are talking in a bar. A player says, "How about we have a conflict now?" Someone answers, "OK! Let's roll some dice."<br/>B--Free play in the bar. Some people start arguing, one threatens another. "Hey! Let's roll dice here!"<br/>C--Same bar. Some people start arguing, draw knives, get into a big brawl. Eventually, the noise stops and the dust settles. "Whoa. Now let's roll to see who's taken critical damage, and who got out early and is already home safe." <br/><br/>Maybe during the fight in C, one of the players had the option of saying, "OK, you totally beat me up bloody-like." Then, on the roll after the fight is over, they get to roll an extra die or something.<br/><br/>A, B, C. Pretty different situations, if you ask me. Anyone have any thoughts or experiences to relate about this (assuming it's OK with the OP)? Interesting examples of how different games handle this sort of thing?<br/><br/>(Edited to clarify one example.)<br/><br/>*: It was called "Conflict-in-the-middle". There was a fair bit of discussion, to be fair, but no one really wanted to bite at the whole deconstructive angle bit, or discuss how various games handled it differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126383/#Comment_126383" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T02:48:17+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  2:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My gut instinct on this is that Blocking is only bad if the players think it is. Most of the time the players know exactly why the GM blocks something and they are fine with it, because an RPG is not Improv theatre, and the players expect some sort of opposition to their character's goals. <br/><br/>The same goes for reaching for the mechanics. If your game has mechanics about who gets to do what (or who gets to say who is doing what) then no one feels bad about them being used, unless they think it was unjustified. I wouldn't have said that the OP's first example felt like blocking, because it seems the action has escalated to a point where I would expect mechanics to be involved. Now of course that only applies for some values of "expect". If players have been regularly shooting grunts, doing stunts, and generally getting away with murder without needing to invoke the mechanics so far, then this example *would* be blocking, because it would seem petty. It's all relative.<br/><br/>Some examples from recent things I have run (all taken from the playtests of Solipsist I have posted here recently, because, well that's what I have been running ... and I get to do shameless name dropping of my product into the bargain).<br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1173" rel="nofollow">one game</a> the players decided to grab some horses from the abandoned farm they were in and ride to their destination. I, as the GM, said "Sorry, there are no horses" and pointed out that they had specifically established this in a previous scene. Was this blocking? No, because the players all agreed that this was true, and were happy with it.<br/><br/>A scene later and they are trying to persuade a drunk Priest to lead them to a grave. They have already got loads of action and information out of him without mechanics, but we have established that he doesn't want to go. They want to persuade him, so I say, "okay, change reality to make him go". Again I didn't feel like this was blocking, because they knew they had crossed a line in what they were trying to do, and no one objected to it.<br/><br/>But in the same game, a little earlier, the characters had ransacked a house for supplies, and wanted to find rope, raincoats, guns, all sorts of stuff. I could have asked them to change reality to get that too, but then I think I *would* have been blocking, because what they were asking to do, without mechanics, was totally in line with all the other things they had already done without mechanics. Asking for a test there, though perfectly within the rules, would have been petty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126401/#Comment_126401" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T05:20:52+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  5:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 5:21AM by Alan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geez, I think this perception of "blocking" is an artifact of player expectations that arise from experiences with hidden drama resolution. You know, the "just roleplay it out" and the GM will decide by fiat approach. Because the GM wants to be a good guy, he'll generally acquiesce to a player who puts enough force of personality into description.<br/><br/>I suggest playing more conflict resolution. Eventually you'll get a different perspective on the call for resolution. It's an exciting uncertainty that can spin your character's story in unexpected directions. You'll drive towards it.<br/><br/>For example, my expectations as player in this exchange:<br/><br/>Player: So I ask him "You see Fat Tony around yesterday?" <i>Thinking: hey, we've made Tony central to the session, so this'll be a great source of opposition. if the GM doesn't declare a conflict, I will.</i><br/>GM: The barkeeper looks at you suspiciously.

Equally, it's possible the GM is trying to avoid a drop in status: "Hey! I don't like you shouting at me! Roll for it!".<br/><br/>But it's also possible he's using the mechanics to <i>escalate</i> the situation: "That's cool! Let's go to dice!".

This creates a sort of "dead end" in the story--now we have to jump-start it again, bring it back to life, with a different idea.<br/><br/>Some resolution mechanics can definitely have this effect--"Roll your Intelligence. [...] Sorry, that was a neat idea, but your character doesn't know anything about the Fire Swamp, so you can't do that."--but most of the mechanics I've seen in recent story game designs try very hard to avoid that. <br/><br/>I think most of the mechanics we're seeing (among this crowd) these days try pretty hard to make sure that, even if the conflict "fails", it spins the story in some new direction and keeps things in motion. Vincent Baker would probably say, "unstable situation, through System, resolves into a new unstable situation". Or something. For instance, if you're playing DitV, the outcome of a conflict will almost certainly be a "No, and" or "Yes, but" or something else that keeps things moving instead of just shutting the story down right there.<br/><br/>On the other hand, where I see more "blocking" is in conversations that aren't strictly about stuff in the game, so they don't get resolved through conflict resolution mechanics. Like when someone says, "Ooh! I want to play a [type of character]!" And the GM (or whoever) answers, "No. There aren't any in this part of the world," or "that's not a legal character class," or something like that. That's blocking, too, isn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126449/#Comment_126449" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T08:44:50+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  8:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 8:46AM by Remi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul's last comment reinforces my feeling that the improv idea of 'blocking' is ill-suited for this conversation.<br/><br/>Blocking is only blocking if it's an in-the-moment decision to deny your scene partner information. This can be as simple as saying 'no' to their suggestion, denying the reality of the situation ("You're crazy!") or denying the knowledge of their character ("You're stupid and know nothing!"). These have very specific, deleterious effects on the scene, often causing it to stop and have to restart itself.<br/><br/>RPGs, because they're not happening in real time, usually, aren't as susceptible to blocking as an improv scene. There are many ways to block certain types of input into a game without shutting down a player completely. These are healthy, these are what create sustained play. Just saying 'yes' to everything in a roleplaying game is almost never the best path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126452/#Comment_126452" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T08:56:16+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  8:56AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my working definition of blocking is someone puts something out there into the narrative, and someone else (essentially) nullifies it. Whether or not the block is "justified" is a separate question. (For example, I would go so far as to say that nullifying a contribution becuase of past established "facts" about the game world is still a block. It might be a justified block, but it still is a block. And it might not even be justified, if the story is described a dreamworld or set in a fairy tale or represents testimony or some such.) Not all blocks are bad. In fact, most RPG mechanics are a form of block. Even setting stakes is a kind of block, because each person takes the time to contribute a possible outcome, and one of those outcomes will get nullified. There's a sense of "wasting creative time" rather than flowing forward constantly. If you like "say yes or roll the dice" could be read as "say yes or block." That is, the rule is to not block for the sake of blocking. If blocking were always bad, the mantra would be "Say yes. Period." <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm actually on the blocking-tends-to-be-bad side of the spectrum. For example,I think a pure say yes system (sometimes called "freeform") is an OK one. I also think mechanics should be able to seamlessly default into say yes only if that is what players want to do. This is one of the reasons I prefer Polaris. For my group, about half the scenes of Polaris we do either involve no use of the conflict mechanics at all, or just "but only if..." and "that was how it happened..." Since "but only if..." only becomes a block (by my definition, a contribution put out was nullified) if someone else eventually uses "it was not meant to be" these are essentially no-block scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The mechanic still matters, because of the Threat of a block still constrains and therefore alters play. But when the blocks in practice don't happen then they have little or no negative impact on Flow)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126456/#Comment_126456" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T09:20:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  9:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always thought of "no, and" as a block as well.

"<br/><br/>I know the concept. I just don't see any nullification in the example. The PC jumped on the table and made a moving speech. Nothing about the GM's actions in the example or the design of games I know requires that that be denied. The only thing at risk is whether the player gets the response he wants -- and that hasn't even been proposed into play yet, so nothing has been nullified. <br/><br/>I can see that a player might feel blocked if they expect that the resolution system will just produce a whiff -- "Sorry, you're action didn't move them to talk. What do you do now?" is a lame result. <br/><br/>This reminds me of the screenplay concept of an "event." Paraphrased for RPGs it would read"<br/><br/>The resolution system changes a character's circumstances in a ways that are irreversable and meaningful to the character and the players. <br/><br/>Lots of game rules strive to produce this result. In actual play we don't always succeed. Any of us who've played years of traditional games (where this often happens) may still half-expect it.<br/><br/>I think this is all about understanding the intent of the resolution system in the specific game and the expectations of the players.<br/><br/>If the player felt he had a right to a particular response from the bartender, I can imagine disappointment, perhaps experienced as blocking. This is why games try to define when the resolution system should be engaged -- to let players know what to expect. When an in-story conflict falls outside the focus of the rules, it may be appropriate to have players describe both initation and resolution of minor conflicts -- for example when it expresses color (eg PTA or Capes). But if the in-story conflict falls within a realm defined as a focus of the game, then the resolution system engages.<br/><br/>Individual rulesets give guidelines for when to engage resolution and also distribute the responsibility for arbitrating those rules. In Trollbabe for example, anyone can call for a dice roll -- and as long as no one calls, any event any player (including the GM) suggests enters the story. In other games, the responsiblity is with the GM and/or supported by guidelines of what is important. (In PTA, conflicts are about Issues or Series Premise, any other conflict can be described without the resolution system).<br/><br/>Note that the conditions for engaging resolution also support or undermine the creative agenda of play. Narrativist play requires a focus on conflict that is meaningful to some theme or other and so has means of defining those themes (A definition of Humanity, Issues, character situation [see Trollbabe and DiTV], etc.)<br/><br/>All this is why I suggested being more aware of player expectations. Also, you might want to reexamine what the boundaries of conflict are in the particular game and ensure everyone is playing for the same goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126521/#Comment_126521" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:07:10+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>All this is why I suggested being more aware of player expectations.

Whether a player will feel blocked (or upset, or whatever) by the mechanics being invoked when they are trying to do something all depends on their expectations from the game. Different games give different sets of expectations ... and different points at which engaging the mechanics will seem appropriate or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126527/#Comment_126527" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:16:10+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what the OP is feeling - and I feel it too - is more that there's a longer "spin up" period for stakes-setting games than there is for, say, your average skill resolution system. In other words, a character who leaps on the bar and yells "YA HOO, I AM THE ROOTINEST TOOTINEST COWPOKE IN THESE HEYEER PARTS AND I'LL WRASSLE ANY MAN FOR A DOLLAR!" (I am tired of cops), in a skill resolution system, the player knows what is going on when the GM says "Roll your Showmanship".  However, to get a result out of a stakes-setting game, the GM must say "Well, what exactly are you trying to accomplish by doing that?" and the answer may be "I don't really know." and the GM must think "Do I want to stop them doing that, and if so, why and how?" and the answer may be "I don't really know."<br/><br/>Such questions never arise in a skill resolution system.

I'm cool with that. Not entirely sure how to stitch it together, but I'll try.<br/><br/>Remi: I think you're right about improv's "blocking" not being a perfect fit. I'll try to distance myself from that for a post or two.<br/><br/>Let me build on JD's quote above. His character just declared that his cowboy can wail on anyone. Then maybe I say next: "Let's roll to see if you've cowed the whole bar, or if instead some of the big guys try to get you to shut up.." And his response could be:<br/>- "That's great! I can challenge and realize whether my character is this kinda guy, whether he can really intimidate folks this time, or whether he gets in over his head."<br/>- "You dork! I *know* my character is intimidating. I was assuming that was already happening - I was going to see then if I could turn these intimidated folks into friends or not, and that's the challenge. But I know my PC was doing intimidating stuff just now - I wasn't interested is seeing her fail."<br/><br/>Okay, so what are the common problems I'm seeing? Some of it is the craft of how to transition in your system into the conflict (with some of that IIEE-ish issues within). Some of it is reading/understanding the people you play with, figuring what they're trying to pull at when they're saying something.<br/><br/>Looking specifically at some of the techniques for pushing to conflict: if I realize that thing have gotten tense and I want to establish a conflict, I want to be careful to not try to re-stake over things that have been established in the fiction, if I can help it. So, JD's cowboy has made it damn clear: here's here to wrassle &amp; break shit. It's possible that this is what we want to focus our challenge, but perhaps I want to accept that first part, and find a challenge in an outcome of that acceptance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126565/#Comment_126565" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:51:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think speed and familiarity with the system might help here.

That is conducive to things like immersion (I think) and GM-plays-the-world, player-plays-the-character-ness.  The best way to get that speed and ease is to be able to set stakes fast, and for players (be they GMs or no) be open to all sorts of crazy stakes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126576/#Comment_126576" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:05:29+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh I didn't see the OP as a contrast between using a task resolution system or using a conflict system, I just saw it as a comment that the GM can block at any time, not by just saying "no" but by saying "oh I think we need mechanics to decide that"<br/><br/>I mean most task resolution systems have this clause that says "we don't roll for actions that are easy, like walking up the stairs, but only for challenging ones" but then it leaves it up to the GM to decide when you have crossed that line, so I can interrupt what you are doing by saying "hey I think the outcome is in doubt, lets use the system here".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126597/#Comment_126597" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:39:37+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:39PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Some of it is reading/understanding the people you play with, figuring what they're trying to pull at when they're saying something.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI've started to think it's a design feature if you can implement a mechanic that does not require any mind reading. I think Polaris handles this beautifully, as one can just accept the other person's statements (and that was how it happened) or escalate at any time. I think DitV handles this OK, with the escalation protocol for the GM to follow. It requires a little bit of GM skill/discretion, but its a pretty straightforward technique to gradually explore how far player's are willing to escalate. PTA has often short circuited on this for us. The producer thinks "this will be a great conflict the player's will love!" followed by one player putting in minimum resources, and another player asking how he can contrive to make his character LOSE the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mind reading aspect is one of the reasons I have come to despise games where a) there is a GM  b) the GM has some sort of central "job" or responsibility to identify conflicts and invoke the mechanics for them and c) I'm the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126639/#Comment_126639" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T13:52:41+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  1:52PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loss of tension.<br><br>Yes, I've experienced that when I have to stop and have a minute or two discussing stakes.

It's rather rare, in my experience, to accidentally go past the moment of resolution, but it's very easy to start in on the maneuvering without breaking out the dice.  Since a lot of games use all that maneuvering and positioning narration to introduce dice and other resources that will be used in the the mechanics that parallel moment of resolution, not breaking out the dice during the manuevering means that you don't have those resources prepared when they're needed.<br><br/>Perhaps there are some steps prior to IIEE?

Do you make the player roll (to vault it) anyway?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/egamad" title="egamad"><img alt="egamad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/egamad">egamad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132069/#Comment_132069" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T10:32:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2008 10:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, sorry if this is all ramblyfied, everyone. I had a terrible time sleeping last night.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>(yeah i dare you to parse my title)<br/><br/>So: I read Graham's<i>Play Unsafe</i>. A smart read, it is.<br/><br/>This morning, I recalled a sequence some like this, in some of my games:<br/><br/>GM: The barkeeper looks at you suspiciously. "We don't talk to cops like you!"<br/>Player: I jump up on top of the bar. "Are you kidding me? I'm exactly the kind of cop you'd best listen to, dude!!"<br/>GM: Okay, so I think we're in a conflict, let me roll out my fancy chart of narrativist conflict resolution and start declaring stakes and twiddlying widgets.</blockquote>\nAnd wow, that technique isn't just clumsy (though it is). It's actually something of a<i>blocking</i>move by the GM there. The player has pushed forward something - an action has taken place in his fiction, and it's presumed there's some reasonable outcomes attached ("they gasp and step back" vs "they appear disinterested"), and what the GM then does it say, hold it: you've narrated something, now let me throw a boundary over it and let's questionify it and decide whether you really meant what you did there.<br/><br/>I'm not criticizing staking technique, but I think a clumsy technique with which it may be applied.<br/><br/>I<i>think</i>the right move here, ideally, is to take that player's input - accept some defeat, in fact - and build on top of that. If I wanted a conflict, it has to be out there without rephrasing/reversing what's already out there. So perhaps the GM should accept the contribution here - the barkeeper is stunned and stammering on the floor, but he's also looking for his secret alarm button as he start babbling, and now the GM and proactively offer a different conflict than before: does the player keep control of this situation?<br/><br/>(And I think this all makes sense with reversing the player/GM roles, or with players-not-GMs involved.)<br/><br/>Dev -- Yeah, this is a way different issue than blocking. To me, it seems like you wanted to play out the tension between the barkeep and the cop a little more (I'm assuming you were the player here) but the GM wanted to skip straight to resolution. That left you feeling like the scene was sold short, since the conflict didn't have enough time to grow into something significant before it blew its top and got resolved.<br/><br/>That's what I'm thinking, anyway. Stop me here if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>There's one piece of advice that my creative writing teacher always told me: start your scenes 1/3 of the way into the conflict and cut out 2/3 of the way in. It's a lot of fun to read about two characters having an argument over spilled wine leading to them facing off on top of a clock tower in a thunderstorm with their families watching from below. Do we need to read about how they decided to go to the bar, sit at the same table, pick their drinks, etc? No way! (Bad example, but bear with me.)<br/><br/>So in your example, I'd say the conflict was about 1/10 of the way done. It had just been introduced, and your GM wanted to skip all the way to resolution.<br/><br/>One solution could be to introduce multi-step resolution mechanics into a game. The players would introduce a conflict, roleplay it a bit, then dice off to see how the conflict continues (fight or flight, conflict or compromise, threats or passive agressiveness, etc.), roleplay <i>that</i>, dice off to see who's feeling what, roleplay it even more, and <i>then</i> dice off to see who wins.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's been done before, but hell if I can think of a game that's done it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My god, I just read over my post, and it's pretty much the most disjointed thing I've ever written. Hopefully y'all'll be able to mine some data out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132131/#Comment_132131" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T13:40:24+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  1:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no, the "start part way in, end before the end" advice from screenwriting/short stories is golden for scenes of a particular kind.
