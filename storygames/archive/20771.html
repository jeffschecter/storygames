If you're looking for high octane Superhero action with a system that feels as familiar as an old glove - look no further!<br/><br/>The Super Hack is a fast playing game whose rules can be picked up in minutes. Character creation is superfast yet allows you to make a huge range of four colour Heroes.<br/><br/>You'll be amazed just how many action packed Superhero adventures you can get out of a single 20 page paperback book. Your favourite comic? Check! A multi-episode animated saga? Check! TV series? Multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster? Check and check again.<br/><br/>It's NEVER been so easy to unleash your inner Superhero!<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/191022/The-Super-Hack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/191022/The-Super-Hack</a><br/><br/>Why should you look at it? <br/><br/>1) Can OSR really do Superheroes? Find out.<br/>2) Have I REALLY managed to fit everything you need into on slim volume? To be honest, I'm pretty amazed I have. Let me know what's missing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
