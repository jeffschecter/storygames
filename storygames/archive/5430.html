The game I'm getting the most mileage out of right now, that's generating tons of enthusiasm from two tables of avid and veteran gamers, has a distribution that's awful.  It's beautiful, professional, in the price-point, and available.  And I don't buy that it's not flying off the shelves because it's not D&amp;D.<br/><br/>It's not flying off the shelves because:<br/><br/>a) for the most part it's not ON the shelves<br/>b) I don't hear about it on the radio<br/>c) I don't hear about it on TV<br/>d) I don't see a poster for it in my game store<br/>e) I don't see it represented at my con<br/>f) it's not for sale anywhere anyone is going to go by accident<br/><br/>All this given that I *know* there are 8 players of this game within a fairly small radius of this city and yet somehow only a couple thousand sold volumes at best.  That's basically selling it to your friends and family and their friends and family.  Selling to people at, say, Gencon, is great and all but you're not exactly tapping into a rich vein -- a handful of enthusiasts willing to travel for their hobby but who really are not the best way to reach everyone else in the game-playing community, let alone people who might be potential first-time gamers.<br/><br/>So how come there's no chatter outside the (extremely insular) internet+RPG scene?  Is real promotion too expensive?  Certainly given how few units are selling without it, it seems like a pretty good investment -- I mean if you had three minutes on a local chat show for a reasonably sized city, you should expect a few hundred sales just from people who have the money to wonder about it in more detail.  Do we just not have the contacts to swing exposure the way a book publisher can for its author?  Is it really that hard?<br/><br/>These are serious questions, by the way -- I'm not saying we've all tried and we just suck because we're morons.  I have no idea what the cost is to really promote something and it may well be that the capital you need to risk to do it at all sets the bar too high.  It just seems like it's the essential failing in the small run games community.  The games are good, they look good, and they are not crazy expensive -- they just seem to be invisible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121751/#Comment_121751" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T14:13:21+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi! <br/><br/>I agree with you. Marketing among indie publishers (i.e. creator-owned publishers), to date, is very ineffective with only a couple small notable bumps for some folks. (Marketing among other RPG publishers pretty well sucks too, but I can't speak to it very well.)<br/><br/>Part of it is the cost involved, no question. And, a big part of it is simply that no one knows how to do it very well, myself included. Even the couple of individuals who do pretty good marketing would still flunk a marketing class, so to speak, given their paltry returns on investment.<br/><br/>Also, it's very tiring and tiresome to do marketing when you're already creating, writing, designing, publishing, revising, planning, promoting etc. etc. It just gets too little attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121752/#Comment_121752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T14:13:35+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify.

I think it's because most indie game designers aren't really interested in marketing or don't really have the time and energy for it, even if they knew how to do it well.  Most are happy with selling several hundred books a year and don't even need to be up in the low thousands like the bestselling indie titles.  Most people got into this because they like producing and playing their own games with their friends and the relatively small indie games community.  There are only a few people with the drive for marketing (*cough* Luke Crane, Fred Hicks *cough*) and the rest of us are just fairly complacent about getting the word out.  Generally speaking, there's more of an "If you build it, they will come" approach to growing the market for small press games, where we lay back and let word of mouth slowly leak the glory of indie gaming to the masses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121755/#Comment_121755" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T14:37:54+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not been around the indie community long but I notice everyone seems to be a chief and there is a shortage of injuns <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I mean is that everyone seems to have a game these days, often more than one, which makes for a market so saturated with product choice that it's almost impossible to see any individual game amongst all the others. I go to IPR, for example, and see far more games than my local games store has on its shelves. Even with the best will in the world its hard to make something stand out in a market like that!<br/><br/>Compare the Indie games market to the computer games market for example. Sure there are many more computer gamers, and a lot more money spent, but even there many games sink without a trace as soon as they are produced, and the big publishers have to limit supply and stagger release dates to get a big enough profile for each game. If we had the mechanisms that the computer game industry employs, like co-ordinated launches, specialist stores, and a small number of magazines that review each product as it is released, we would find promotion easier too I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121759/#Comment_121759" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T14:44:58+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell, I have an honours degree in Marketing and I work as a Marketing Manager and the ever-shifting sands of the subject still bamboozle me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things do strike me though:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cost is obviously an issue, especially when it comes to simple things like enjoying economies of scale with regard to printing and postage. Even the production of a reasonably priced and professionally printed A2 poster for a shop can be quite costly if done in small quantities. Fliers and other printed promotional material can also incur some heavy costs through distribution. For example, say I was to deliver a Duty &amp; Honour A2 poster and 100 A6 post-card style fliers out to 20 shops? I'd be looking at print costs of around $140 (ish), around $160 postage and maybe a conservative $80 packaging. Thats $380 on a 'simple' mail drop. With NO guarantee that the store/club/bookshop will actually do anything more than throw the materials in the bin.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I'd also be looking at the targetting of the materials - whatever materials - and whether it was accurate - how much of my materials are being wasted. For example in the UK I'm unaware of any suitable radio or TV outlets that would even consider taking an interview about an up and coming roleplaying games designer and his penchant for Napoleonic history. And even if they did - what chance that gamers or gaming-curious listeners or viewers would be listening. I think thats why people do tend towards the safe stuff - conventions, ads in other games, promotions through reviews, podcasts and yes, the slow drip-drip-drip awareness build from sites like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Even with these methods we don't really account the costs. I'll be toddling up to Edinburgh in March to Conpulsion (cheap pop) to demo the ass out of D&amp;H.; The costs of that con - entry, travel, food and accommodation - should really be accounted as marketing costs. Because you damned well know that when WotC send a dozen members of staff to a convention with a metric f*ckton of product and a massive stand every single cent of that is accounted for out of their marketing budgets. When you think about it, consider the costs in accommodation, travel and stalls for say .. Green Ronin... to attend GenCon US? And then compare that to the marketing collateral available to most game designers. Its scary when those scales hit in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we shouldn't be too dismayed however - there is some stuff that the small press creators can do that can be better than the bigger companies. We can excel at customer service and customer facing communications. We can build truly supportive communities for our games which enhance the products rather than parody them. We can come together and share skills and opportunities and contacts ( like The Collective Endeavour in the UK) as well as experiences.  Hell, we could - if we got our act together - create something like a mutualistic printing agreement. Everyone lodges a poster in a central file space and agrees that they will print out say 10 posters and take them down to their local game stores and distribute them - on the understanding that their materials are also being distributed by other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don't have the monetary resources of the larger companies or the massive corps that back them but we do have a smorgasbord of smarts and energy and almost no red tape. Thats got to count for something.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121760/#Comment_121760" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T14:49:37+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><br>What I mean is that everyone seems to have a game these days, often more than one, which makes for a market so saturated with product choice that it's almost impossible to see any individual game amongst all the others.

Failing to stand out at IPR isn't much of a problem when no interesting number of people are browsing IPR anyway.  For the most part I expect people go to IPR when they already know what they want and *maybe* get something else to get a price break on shipping, which means that it's of limited value promotionally whether you stand out or not.<br><br>You really want to somehow make a buyer think of your game when they are not even thinking of buying a game, let alone an RPG, let alone an indie one, let alone yours.

I think Jonathan is right, part of it is that a lot of indie designers just aren't interested in running a business. It's about a labor of love and if there's a profit, well, that's a nice bonus.  But there's also a lot who secretly (or not so secretly) want to be the next big thing.  And for them, they could easily buy some big advertising.<br><br>~$400k for a national spot might be asking a bit much (it would take 2-4,000 designers to match the buy-in for the Forge Booth last GenCon), but you can get a spot on local cable, even on a huge networks like ESPN or CNN for under ~$15-$80, depending on the market you're in. I'm not sure what the packages are (I doubt you can buy a single spot, but maybe!), but even 200 spots would be under $10k and that's enough spots to run once an hour for over a week, reaching tens of thousands of people each time.  If you could work with a local shop where they could go to buy the game, maybe even play a demo, then it might have even more appeal (and let the shop take up some of the costs).<br><br/>And radio is usually cheaper if you're not up for a big risk.<br/><br/>And of course, there's also creating a viral advertisement, which can cost as little as you want to put into it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121767/#Comment_121767" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T15:27:58+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  3:27PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2008 3:28PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ROI, economies of scale, and time investment involved all equal Not Worth It.<br/><br/>A small hobbyist designer (like myself) can expect zero return on investment for even the cheapest TV spot, newspaper ad, or the like. To see even a small profit from the "little" local cable ad that Alvin talks about, I would have to sell 3,000 books at retail. No one is moving 3,000 units of <i>anything</i> with a local TV spot run for a week or two. This is also why you only see spots for Magic cards for maybe a couple days around a major release.

Marketing is not "advertising." It might <i>include</i> advertising. And, Harper's bang on. Even Wizards would be, well, really stupid to advertise in most mass media channels (especially TV and radio). <br/><br/>There are lots of other ways to market products. Viral marketing is taking advantage of word-of-mouth. Direct marketing is contacting established customers with updates and calls to action, presumably via email (or even just snail mail, which can get pricey). Give aways and contests are marketing. So is sponsorship (of conventions, for example). And buying pay-per-click campaigns on Google. Etc.<br/><br/>Harper's also bang on about laziness. I don't think that's really the culprit. Sure, that might be some of it.  But, it's more about whether things are worth a publisher's time. So far, not much has panned out that I'm aware of. Again, a couple exceptions, but there's precious little conventional wisdom. <br/><br/>For example, one of the problems is that there are very few niche media outlets, and those that exist aren't especially well-suited to indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121788/#Comment_121788" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T16:46:57+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  4:46PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thing that worked for me.<br/><br/>At one time, I owned pretty much all of IPR's catalog.

When I pushed I got some.  If I pushed every week, there would constantly be a half dozen titles in the store.  Maybe twice that.  That's still only half a shelf out of thirty shelves, though -- as exposure goes it's very limited.<br/><br/>And then I'm basically the consumer, so when I do that I'm doing the author/publisher's promotional work for him, frequently for a game I already own.  You can't count on that kind of thing -- the payoff for me is limited.<br/><br/>As for promotion being separate from distribution, I have to strongly disagree.  Books on shelves is part of promotion -- and promotion also influences whether a store owner stocks your stuff -- you have to sell him on these things too.  They are intimately related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121828/#Comment_121828" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T01:48:42+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  1:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In response to Filip's list of priorities I finding it hard to understand now marketing can not enhance your ability to publish your games and not go broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another reply Matt Snyder said 'marketing is not advertising. It might include advertising' - thats so hitting the nail on the head that the nail is suing for damages!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy not wanting to go broke I'm going to assume that you are paying money for the publishing and therefore need to sell the games rather than give them away. How will people know that you have games to sell if you don't tell them? How will they know what your game is about if you never let the cat out of the bag? How will they know where to purchase the game if it isn't flagged somewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nMarketing doesn't have to cost a penny (ok, arguments about opportunity costs aside...). Every time you post on a site like this or the Forge or rpg.net or a myriad others you are marketing your game. Everytime you reply to someone who asks a question about your game in a friendly, inclusive manner you are marketing your game. Everytime you post about your game in your blog .... guess what? If you are at a con and you are chatting to someone about your game - its marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr to put it another way - imagine a real asshat forum poster. Someone who has bad words to say about just about everything. He disses everyone elses games, starts arguments where none exist and is pedantic in the extreme. And then he announces that he has this cool new game that he wants people to buy. Has he helped or hindered his chances of making a sale?<br/>\n<br/>\nEVEN if you have a captive market of say 100 friends who will buy your product straight from you, on your doorstep, you STILL have to undertake some marketing activity to achieve those sales! Keeping the product relevant to their interests, letting them know it exists - its all marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarketing =/= Advertising =/= $$$$ - it can, but it doesn't have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121829/#Comment_121829" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T01:50:06+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  1:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this thread is making me think seriously about the marketing strategy that I have for Solipsist ... and realizing that there isn't one, and that I probably don't have the time, or the money, to have one. <br><br>This is probably true for many games designers. You write the game, playtest it with people you know (primarily), promote it to friends and on communities like this, hoping it will get noticed, make a website, go to a few cons, list it on IPR, and that is as much as you can do. I don't have the free time to go to a dozen cons with my game, or to try and sell direct to 100 stores, or to make flyers and posters (and I have no idea where I would send them anyway if I did), and I don't have the contacts (which seem all important) to guarantee reviews by people who count, or APs on the Forge, or any other other viral methods that form an alternative to traditional marketing.<br><br>So, realising this, I am thinking about why, and I think my answer is like Filip Luszczyk's above, because it isn't the point. I want to publish my game, and I will be happy if people like it and buy it (make that overjoyed) but I regard the printing costs as an upfront loss. I am realisitic enough to realise I will probably never make them back and I'm okay with that, because the designing and publishing is an end to itself.

You need to take a scientific approach. For example, I run the webzine See Page XX. I add random banner rotations, and pass on an affliate or source code to the store I'm linking to. When I do print advertising (infequent!) I add a voucher code useable at the checkout. Even if you don't have access to this, you can set up a unique url, not linked from anywhere else which you can measure responses to using web stats. This works with any advertising which includes a url.<br/><br/>Rpgnow.com provides banner impressions and front page text messages on rotation, and offers percentage clickthroughs for both, as well as letting you know which sales come from where. You can soon discover which swipe line, image or sell text gets the best response, and you can use that elsewhere.<br/><br/>Your existing customer base, as long as you treat them respectfully, are also open to properly targetted marketing. Short pithy emails which offer something tangible in addition to the marketing message get a decent response for the time and effort. <br/><br/>Fred Hicks is very good at another kind of marketing - that is, communicating with customers and potential customers online - first you've got to find them. See this post of his for some very useful <a href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/319337.html" rel="nofollow">advice</a>. But, don't go around fighting people online. <br/><br/>Send out review copies by all means, but read other reviews to see if they are likely to be well inclined towards your game; or misunderstand it. The most telling phrase to look out for is "I am confused."<br/><br/>Then there is piggybacking. Many resellers offer cheap or even free marketing opportunites, including IPR, rpgnow.com and your fellow publishers. For example, for Page XX, I always offer banners in rotation in exchange for articles.<br/><br/>For Trail of Cthulhu, I've tried something new. I've placed an ad in Game Buyer targeted at retailers, and a banner ad on Alliance Games retailer ordering site. I've run a long-term development blog with lots of really nice artwork and communication with potential advocates and customers. When it releases I'll be sponsoring yog-sothoth.com and putting banners around the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121852/#Comment_121852" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T06:39:55+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  6:39AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>Every time you post on a site like this or the Forge or rpg.net or a myriad others you are marketing your game.</blockquote>\nGod grant that this never be true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121855/#Comment_121855" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T06:51:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  6:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pelgrane</cite>I've tried lots of different marketing and advertising strategies for Pelgrane Press, with varying degrees of success...</blockquote>\nThose are some great, practical suggestions, Simon.

In a community where the products can be so easily tied to the writer and the relationships with the customers can be so close and personal you have to consider your conduct when you post and interact with people. In one of my former CCG communities one of the designers was ... well, very hard work indeed. He was never wrong. He always knew more about everything than anyone else that would dare disagree with him. He never made a bad design decision. His manner was, to many people, frustrating, obstructive and sometimes down-right rude. I know a good few people who cast aside hundreds of dollars of investment in cards and quit the game because they could not handle putting money into the guys hand. Now thats quite an extreme example but even in a smaller scale it is very easy for someone to shoot themselves in the foot by being abusive to their clientele.<br/><br/>Neil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121859/#Comment_121859" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T07:08:33+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  7:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that there is any such thing as bad press.

For such a niche market as RPGs, that can be a pretty expensive shot in the dark.<br/><br/>I think something better would be a more general approach to making RPGs as a whole less of a niche market. Someone earlier mentioned other kinds of hobbies, like stamp and coin collecting, but those have been around much longer, are much more easily accessed and have a greater immediate value than playing/collecting role-playing games. The trick is to get more people out looking for these games, to let them know they exist.

The public perception of this activity - and don't overfocus on the RPG term, the task remains the same no matter what we call them and I'm not sure why I'm using the term myself - has to shift from "niche activity I couldn't possibly be interested in" to "new and kicky way to engage in something I'm interested in already." <br/><br/>The main opportunity bundled with this challenge is the fact that mainstream RPG publishers would benefit too. For reference, see the last ten to twenty years of the history of the graphic novel - it went through exactly the transformation above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121892/#Comment_121892" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T10:00:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2008 10:00AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My general experience is that people's attitude is "something I used to do in HS but don't have time for" or "something that I've heard about, might be interested in, but don't really know how it works."<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121893/#Comment_121893" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T10:13:08+00:00" title="January 25, 2008 10:13AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we need to look at those in terms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" rel="nofollow">Overton windows</a>, and develop strategies for moving the window towards where we want it to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121894/#Comment_121894" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T10:16:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2008 10:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite><cite>Posted By: Pelgrane</cite>I've tried lots of different marketing and advertising strategies for Pelgrane Press, with varying degrees of success...</blockquote>\nThose are some great, practical suggestions, Simon.

Tragically, in all the searching I was doing about six months ago, I found almost no research (unsurprising, considering the volume, but sad nonetheless) and what I did find drew assumptions from excruciatingly small data sets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think whoever touched on the linking/referral method probably found the most bang:buck, but I wouldn't expect it to move a huge number of books. Anyone who's gotten me talking about it at a Con has probably heard my idea to make a, "Which roleplaying game are you?" quiz and let it make the rounds on blog sites, with linking to stores. I think it'd work, but nobody's stolen my idea yet, so. ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

Personally, I'd love to see more indie RPGs selling. Ruthless capitalism aside, more indie RPGs selling = more market share = more like-minded people with which to game. I forewarn now that I'm a business traveler and in the likely event that someone doesn't like what I have to say, I'll probably have to be silent about it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as a buyer I find the indie RPG scene, at least with regards to the few shops I've encountered, to be somewhat "brand schizophrenic." There are a lot of games that are awesome, some not so great, and we don't have the wealth of information available to us to make the determination as we do when buying, say, a vacuum. More importantly, there also isn't a cohesive vision as far as the breadth and scope of the products that are sold; if you look at a successful company (I'm going to use Apple because everyone likes talking about it), they design and sell products which fulfill certain functions and avoid overloading them with features or forcing short-term obsolescence their other lines because, unsurprisingly, it cuts into their volume and obviously their bottom line. In other words, there are games on IPR that provide an entertainment:$$$ ratio that is obviating the need for future purchases. Why buy a new game when your group is chomping at the bit to keep playing one you already picked up? Yeah, I don't know either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis takes me to my second point: RPGs can, and do, work themselves out of a job. If you sell a game that has so much depth to it that people feel they haven't sufficiently consumed it in a short enough period of time, you will derail future sales, either for yourself or someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'd scarcely be a consumer advocate if I suggested that you should pare down your games and sell additional "expansions" to those games for the sake of increasing market share, but I'd be remiss if I said I didn't think that having people return to the altar (e.g. fork over money) occasionally doesn't contribute substantially to a positive selection bias. In other words, people will play and enjoy your games more because they've paid more to play them. Take it with a grain of salt; its like every other content model ever devised for the RPG industry (e.g. based on hunches or extrapolated from markets that share enough similarity to be comparable, and enough differences to make the same comparisons dangerous!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, ultimately, I'm not sure that the goal of moving more books is readily achievable with conventional marketing strategies (though in my world, design is marketing is engineering is design...). Instead, I think that if the goal is to move more books and get more people playing indie RPGs, more attention has to be given to the overall product life cycle (meaning, how that product is released) and the overall market in which these games are being sold. The ugly truth of that is finding ways to space out releases and aggressively retire content that reduces overall sales (solvable with post-purchase surveys). Anyone care to wear the black hood? I didn't think so. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy to say, tough to do! My two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Indie Promotion Sucks - Page 2 - Story

(and the ill-fated Games Expo) and they'll be attending GTS again this year. The idea is to build up a relationship with the few retailers willing to actively promote sales of indie games. It doesn't work if they just sit on the shelf. There are only a few retailers in that category, but they order a lot of indie games. Because they are all vetted for quality, and don't make claims to be the be-all and end-all of roleplaying games, customers who buy one often buy others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIPR doesn't give retailers quite as high discounts as some other distributors, which is good for the publisher and puts off more casual retailers. John Harper's example is sterling - if a retailer places an order they are very likely to continue stocking products in this category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122261/#Comment_122261" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T02:31:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blake T. Deakin</cite>In other words, there are games on IPR that provide an entertainment:$$$ ratio that is obviating the need for future purchases. Why buy a new game when your group is chomping at the bit to keep playing one you already picked up? Yeah, I don't know either.</blockquote>\nWell I think the RPG industry has always survived on the fact that may people don't buy a game to play, or will buy a game when they already have access to a copy.<br/><br/>In the first case I count myself amongst the many who have shelves full of games I have never played, because they have great backgrounds, or because I want to mine them for ideas, or because they look good, or just because I like reading game systems.<br/><br/>In the second case there is a good market drive from the phenomenon that someone buys a game, and plays it with friends, and if they decide to keep playing everyone in the group buys a copy.<br/><br/>However I'd have to say that the second factor can't be as great for Indie games designed for short play. If the rules are 8 pages long, and you are only going to play a couple of times in a year, you won't encourage the players to go and get their own copies, as they would for a long term weekly game. On the other hand since many Indie games are cheaper than their mainstream counterparts they may well get more impulse buys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20Boser" title="Tim Boser"><img alt="Tim Boser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20Boser">Tim Boser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122272/#Comment_122272" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T05:04:34+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:04AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Here's a thing that worked for me.<br/><br/>At one time, I owned pretty much all of IPR's catalog. So I took the books to my local game store and spread them out on a table (I have a good relationship with the owner, and could do this without being an ass). When the store wasn't busy, he walked over and I gave him a 10 second rundown for each game. Then I gave him the contact info for IPR.<br/><br/>Within two weeks, he had an indie games shelf front and center in the store, with multiple copies of pretty much everything. He's been steadily restocking and expanding it since and has turned into quite the indie games evangelist himself.<br/><br/>That's the scale we're operating on. Individuals, taking action. It can get results.</blockquote>\nSo with this in mind, I have a suggestion. <br/><br/>Why not use some sort of online forum (Story Games would work well, I believe), to work out a sort of "small press street team" type thing? Everybody who wanted to pitch in time and resources could do just that. The services of the street team would be available for free to any small-press game publisher, on the understanding that no single gets the most attention. People could contribute poster designs in PDF format, print said posters out on their own printers (or using a local Kinko's) and take them to put up in their local gaming stores, organize and run small press demo days in said stores, show up at cons where these games might not be regularly present to promote/demo them, and generally do what can be done to generate PR for a lot of great games that definately deserve a bigger part of the spotlight. I for one would definately be interested in helping out with this, since it seems that I'm the only one in my area who even pays any attention to indie/story/small press games. <br/><br/>Any thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122317/#Comment_122317" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:45:29+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, For the past six years I have been promoting HinterWelt starting with Tales of Gaea up to the last book Roma Ture20. Here is what I have done and what has worked and what has not worked.<br/><br/>Forum Posts: Well, nominal success but not entirely great. This could be a function of my posting style or the way I have structured HinterWelt. It does help to get adopters and works a lot like passive advertising (i.e. you get your name infront of people enough times they remember you).<br/><br/>Internet driven advertising: Works for the PDF side. It worked far better for Roma True20 than for our Iridium and OGL books. This is partly due to brand recognition.<br/><br/>Print ads: We have advertised in Dragon, KODT, PS232 and a handfull of smaller mags. KODT gave us a great return while the others a much lesser return with Dragon being a bust. We do not advertise like this much anymore since the market has changed considerably and I just think it does not pay as well.<br/><br/>Convention Support: this is different from Con attendance. Usually we send books, maps and posters and in return get an ad in thier program. This has gone well with a few even resulting in staff running demos.<br/><br/>Convention Attendance: This can work. It requires some knowledge of the con you are going to and especially the theme. I have tried at Gen Con to run Roma, Neb, Tales, Shades and Squirrels. Roma has never had anyone attend and neither has Tales. Shades and Neb depends. Out of the 10 or so events about 7 were near or at capacity, while the others had enough to run. Squirrels have always been at capacity and turning folks away. This invariably results in sold games.<br/><br/>Retailer presence: This trumps all others for us. Getting into stores is tough but once you are there it is easy to grow. Make sure you talk to the owners and get their permission to use them as references to other stores. I have found the three tier distro to work for me as an advertising tool, reaching stores I might not on my own. I work outside the usual channels also with about 60 stores as direct customers. This can assure me sales out the gate with new products.<br/><br/>Direct mailings: I just can't bring myself to spam. Heck, I have had customers ask for such things but it always weirds me out. As a result, I have not had much luck when pursuing this approach.<br/><br/>I am sure there are more but those are the big ones. Oh, and remember it is good to get listed with new print releases in things like Game Buyer and whatever the Game Catalog is being called today.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122319/#Comment_122319" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:47:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>Is real promotion too expensive?</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/>Worse, it has an absolutely shitty return on investment ratio.<br/><br/>This is why I orient almost exclusively on goosing word-of-mouth for Evil Hat's games.  <br/><br/>Word of mouth is free, more likely to be trusted by the listener than <i>any other form of promotion</i>, and thoroughly supports the long tail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122322/#Comment_122322" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:50:32+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'd love to hear less:<br/><br/>"Indie RPG Marketing sucks!"<br/><br/>and more:<br/><br/>"Here are tangible and workable suggestions to make indie RPG marketing suck less..."</blockquote>\nClyde and I sat down at Dreamation to talk about some of this.

What I can say with absolute assuredness is that no (edit: I'm defining "existence" to mean has sat on, at the very least, a 100K campaign... I'm sure WotC has gone scrounging in the bargain bin on this one) shop has ever really done a case study on RPGs because the market is not big enough to warrant it. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just that no one's found it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically enough, marketing and successful marketing does not necessarily demand a large outlay of money. It does require your product me exceptional (the market doesn't tolerate things that aren't), that you not do anything to generally piss off your customers, and that you don't treat them with indifference either. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, rather than ramble I'll just link someone who I think has the answers:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/<br/>\n<br/>\n(Please don't take the "non-profit" angle as a jab, it doesn't even best approximate our particular business case, but it does have a lot of similarities that make it worthwhile to read.

I think that in some areas, indie game publishers (and RPG publishers in general) are actually far ahead of the curve in marketing techniques. Because game publishers, on the whole, have far fewer resources at their disposal than larger companies (and I mean larger companies, not larger game companies), they have been forced to adopt new technologies and new techniques.<br/><br/>When it comes to social marketing specifically -- using message boards, social networking sites, blogs, podcasts, videocasts, etc., to reach the public -- game companies are on the bleeding edge. Larger companies pay market researchers lots of money to tell them the best practices for using the techniques that we've been perfecting for the past few years.<br/><br/>It is only in traditional marketing and advertising that RPG publishers fall behind. And the problems in that area are difficult to overcome.<br/><br/>Only large companies with products that have extremely broad appeal can afford to blast their messages out to anyone and everyone, and even then it's inefficient.<br/><br/>It's much more efficient to find and target influentials (people that other people look to for advice when it comes to purchases). Influentials are not of a type either. They can be broken down into classic influentials and new influentials (among other ways). <br/><br/>Classic influentials like to be the first to discover a message and communicate it to their friends. They tend to have a narrow field of expertise, like White Wolf games or D&amp;D or D20, etc., or even just a single game.<br/><br/>New influentials like to be the first to discover a message and communicate it to everyone, for instance via blogs, podcasts or reviews. New influentials tend to have a more generalist approach, harvesting information about many different topics from many different sources and packaging or repackaging it. Because new influentials spread their message to friends and strangers alike, the network of those to whom they spread their messages tend to be much larger.<br/><br/>There are also combination influentials, who play both roles, but they are exceedingly rare.<br/><br/>Anyway, both classic influentials and new influentials play very important roles in spreading messages. New influentials are the best at creating brand awareness. They learn that a product exists and communicate it to their networks.<br/><br/>Classic influentials, on the other hand, tend to be the ones who tip the scales when it comes to the purchase decision. Friends seeking advice tend to go to the classic influential to learn more about a product and get the thumbs up or thumbs down.<br/><br/>The problem RPGs companies face is that there aren't enough data available to allow them to discover who the influentials are and how best to approach them. Who are the people that seek out/buy/play games? What makes them interested in a game? What features increase the chances they'll buy or play a game? How do they find out about games? What sorts of Web sites do they visit? What magazines do they read? What age are they? What's their annual income?<br/><br/>We assume we know the answers to some of these questions based on received wisdom, anecdotes and gut instinct. But we don't really know anything. Our assumptions could be wrong or wildly off base.<br/><br/>The closest thing we have to this sort of information is a study Wizards of the Coast undertook in the late 1990s as it geared up for the release of D&amp;D 3.0. Other than that, we have very little information. And that information is necessary to developing metrics with which to measure the effectiveness of marketing and to ensure that resources are being used as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>If we were to attempt to do more marketing, developing this sort of data would be a necessary first step. I'd be interested in seeing an organization like GAMA create an annual study to gather this sort of information, if it's feasible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122513/#Comment_122513" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T17:53:46+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part I<br/>--------<br/><br/>Um... ok so I'm new around here and I guess I'm going to just blow it with a big old over the top post that's probably so far gone you guys are going to be like ... woah... wtf.   Apologies in advance then.   <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>   But here's what your thread made me think...<br/><br/>It's an interesting question.   I've read the entire thread and I think a lot of people make great points.   Ok, here's my Big Picture Answer.<br/><br/>Recap<br/>---------<br/><br/>1.  Selling a few thousand copies of your RPG is not sufficient to call it a market success, especially if you barely break even. 2.  No one seems to have succeeded in figuring out how to sell Indie RPGs.  3.  Traditional marketing methods are too expensive to gain ROI for small capital indie developers.   4.  There are non-traditional methods of marketing that do not necessarily involve heavy financial cost.  Viral being most popular.   5.  If your goal is to make money out of this hobby you may be barking up the wrong tree, and a clear minded view of the current evidence would suggest as much.  6.  There are certain avenues of approach that are more successful than others when it comes to marketing.  7.  The current market appears to be glutted.   8.  There *must* be a solution out there somehow...<br/><br/>I think it's probably the case that we should admit that it is *possible* that there actually may be no solution to the question: How do I make it big selling my RPG?   It's possible.   And I do think it's a good idea to question your motives.   Are you in this for the art?  Are you in this for the fun?   Are you in this to make a killing in the marketplace?   I also like what someone said on this:  As you sell more games, you are also expanding the concept of the games... and that may fulfill some people's aspiration as well - with the money simply being an indicator of success, not the goal itself.   But again, lets admit that there *may* be no solution... <br/><br/>However, that said, I don't believe it.   I think it is possible to find a solution.  But I think it is going to be much more involved and difficult (and important) a thing than simply making "my RPG sell a lot".   This is the kind of thing that I believe requires a larger goal, a higher inspiration if you will.  And that's because what I perceive to be "the problem of low Indie RPG sales" is a symptom of a larger more profound problem.   I come to the Big Picture in a moment.   <br/><br/>Not much has been said so far that would lead me to believe we are as yet particularly close to the solution.   The people who have offered constructive ideas have taken their best examples and said, "This is what has and hasn't worked for me.  Try the successful ones and you may do as well as I have."  But we already know that by the criteria of the goal presented no one has succeeded yet, and therefore, even though these cases may be best practice thus far, they're still falling far short of where we want to be.   Those among us who want to sell a few hundred thousand copies or more are not satisfied with solutions that might help us sell a few thousand and possibly break even.  And yes, while we are innovating with podcasts and youtube which is great and awesome, we're still looking at low sales numbers.   Ok... on to the Big Picture.<br/><br/>We're not seeing the forest for the trees.   We need, I think, to examine the problem from the 50,000 foot level first.   Then, maybe, we may be able to get a sense of a broad based strategy.   So here it goes.   Feel free to totally disagree, but my own anecdotal experiences lead me in the following (hazardous) direction...<br/><br/>Factors of Prior Success<br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>The first question to ask is:  What made RPGs popular to begin with?   <br/><br/>Well, we start with, of course, D&amp;D.   It became pretty popular.  Why?   When I was a kid in high school D&amp;D 1st Edition (the three magical parchment books) first came out.   What made our group gravitate toward it?   <br/><br/>It was The New Thing.   It was fun.  It was imagination-enhancing.   It was cheap.   As a GM you could build out on the ideas yourself, and they presented themselves as extensible.   It was something you could do with your friends.   It gave you something to think about between games.  It encouraged teamwork.  It encouraged intelligence.   It put you in a magical Other place.   Note:  D&amp;D appealed to the Brainiacs (wargammers, chess players, and fantasyists).    Note:  Jocks did not play D&amp;D.   Note: about 25% of our group were girls, and none of them were what you would call "Hot" chicks, though many of them were actually very attractive.   But not "Hot", if you get the distinction.   The most successful people in our town were the D&amp;D players.   Most of them went on to become captains of industry, inventors, doctors and lawyers, and so on.   Ok.  So that was the demographic of the early RPGers, as far as the anecdotal example of my town was concerned.   Success oriented Brainiacs played D&amp;D.   It was an interesting time, one aching for some sort of creative release.   Remember we were post the Hyper-Creativity of Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, The Beatles, Quick Silver Messenger Service, The Doobie Brothers, and the Great Cultural Revolution was drifting further and further into the past.  And D&amp;D came along and filled a certain vaguely discernible void.  But most of all, I'm going to say that we liked RPGs because they encouraged creativity and imagination unlike anything we'd ever run across before.  Now you could be The Hero of Your Own Amazing Adventure Tales!  And as a GM you could be The Mythopoetic Creator of Entire Fantasy Universes! It was Improv Theater wrapped around a Wargame nested inside of a Literary Epic. That's powerful stuff.   No wonder we went gah gah for it.<br/><br/>The Problem<br/>-------------------<br/>Now lets step back from our contemporary society for a minute and fly to 50,000 feet.   Look down.   What do you see?   What I see is a dark cloud of intellectual smog pouring out of TV and the movies.   It's a smog that says "It's cool to be stupid as hell.  It's smart to be corrupt as hell.  It's necessary to be sexy as hell".   That message is casting its slouching dismal smog over the creative imaginative souls of the world, of which there are an outstanding few wandering around.   There are a few would-be luminaries on the hilltops gleaming yet, but if we compare today's creative enterprises and their effects with those of a former time we might notice that their is an order of magnitude less ... enthusiasm.   Our creative aspirations have become ... small.   We used to want to save the world.  Now... we want to make a cool RPG.   We may not even care if anyone plays it.   Don't be offended.   We're all in the same boat here.<br/><br/>So, lets ask another basic question:  What makes RPGs fun?   Imagination?   Challenge?   Social intercourse?   Teamwork?   Self Expression?  The Spirit of Adventure?  <br/><br/>Now lets look around at the competition for RPGs (which I'm surprised no one has mentioned - even if you disagree, which many do, it should still probably be mentioned).   WoW.   EverQuest.   Call of Asheron.   Eve.    All of these games and more have taken the place of what the P&amp;P RPG used to be when I was growing up.   They're the New Thing.  Visual-Colorful.  Easy to learn.   Easy to play.  Nix the following:  Imagination-Enhancing.   What these games are not, as we all know, is Creative for the Payers.   You just run around and you can only do what the MMORPG programmers let you do, and pathetically enough in my opinion, a lot of that turns out to be Game-Churn.  <br/><br/>P&amp;P RPGs?   Do whatever your imagination inspires.   They are open ended, creative enterprises with often unpredictable results and, when played in such a way, often produce amazing stories that we think mean something to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122514/#Comment_122514" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T17:54:06+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 6:01PM by VBWyrde.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part II<br/>----------<br/><br/><br/>Possible Solutions<br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>So I think this is one really deep question we would want to answer:  How do we take back our culture from the Hollywierds so that the nihilistic cloud that is slaying creative thought is sucked back in its dark black pit where it belongs?   If we were to do that I think we would be able to talk more about how we can make our RPGs sing like the birds, and fly into the heavens because we will once again have a culture that values creativity more than muscle, imagination more than bikini-thongs.   And people will stop saying "RPGs... ewwwww... weird."   and start saying, "When are you guys playing next?"<br/><br/>Hint:  RPGs can be a vehicle for killing the shadow.   In fact, personally, I can think of no finer vehicle.  <br/><br/>Where would we start?  Well, my suggestion is that we consider ways, inexpensive, but effective ways, to rebrand RPGs as the Fun Creative Shadow Stomping Activity of Super Successful Minds.   We get out there and say to John Q Public "Hey Dude, Get Your Mind In Gear and Start THINKING for yourself - its Awesome!".   We say to Jane Q Public "You want your kids to exercise Intelligence, Teamwork, Imagination, Planning, Organization and explore the vast realms of History, Culture and become fully activated human beings?   Then get them an RPG for Christmas!"   We need to get into the High Schools and say "Dudes, this is the game that is going to actually teach you stuff that you're going to remember for the rest of your life.   It counts."   We need to tell teachers:  "These games teach.   These games are more than just some mind draining waste of time.  You need creativity and intelligence for them and these games are the ultimate human game creation of our time."   We need to drive forward with The Big Picture.    And we need to roll over the competition... who knows, years from now Hollyweird might come out of its wierd miasma of perplexation and say, "Woah, these kids are Right!"  and actually make some great films again.  And TV...?   Well, I digress.  But think you get my point.<br/><br/>Hah.  Now I'm sure you guys are going to be like "OMFG!  WTF is this guy talking about!?"   (My excuse:  "its the drugs")<br/><br/>Well, since someone asked what I think, that's my thinking on the topic, for what it's worth.   <br/><br/>As for how to actualize such a concept and bring it into the real world... I'd say that would make an interesting discussion.   I'd certainly be up for throwing ideas around.   I'd be into trying out some stuff.  Here are some questions I'd start with:   What are inexpensive ways to get these concepts into the public eye?   What can guerrilla theatre do for us?   What kinds of game designs and/or settings would make our case more powerful?   How can we gather energy around this?  How do you start ... A movement?<br/><br/>Ok... I retire back to my game design now, with a somewhat glum feeling that my words shall fall like silent raindrops into the well...<br/><br/>Surprise me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

I can understand why people might read that and think... wait a second... are you really trying to say that RPGs can save the frikkin world?  <br/><br/>Yup.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Mark<br/><br/><br/><br/>... but of course while it's possible, and I can see how... that's a very very far cry from saying I think it will happen.  If we don't have the time and energy to even so much as market our RPGs much... well... you get the point.   Nor am I saying that if we don't tackle the huge moral dementia of our time that none of our Indie RPGs will sell a million copies.  Oh it's possible.  But, I'm just saying that RPGs as a vehicle for social change has great potential.   I can see it.   Now the question is ... will anyone else see it?

There is a cost to growth, and the more rapid that growth, the more it costs.</p>\n<p>Now, we've got this brave new world of people talking honestly and passionately about things made by people they know. It works for marketing! It really does! Everyone can smell a shill, so the thing JD is worried about doesn't really happen. Instead, what happens is, people hear about you and your game because you have friends who talk about you and your game. They say things that are interesting, provocative, and most of all, <em>true</em> about your game.

It's a process that, if it were controlled, would stink and no one would pay attention. But it can be <em>encouraged</em> \u2014 and there's only one way to do that: make something good enough that you can speak about with with sincere confidence and the humility that necessarily goes alongside it, play it and enjoy it, and play it with others until they frickin' quadruple-book your slots at Dreamation. Cuz then those people are going to go away and tell other people about the great time they had, and the process will continue.</p>\n<p>(<a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16194&amp;cat=3&amp;bestseller" rel="nofollow">Shock: Social Science Fiction</a>, version 1.1, by designer Joshua A.C.

I know I have seen some people complain that some of their games get little or no sales, and not every designer (or game) is created equal. Its great to know that some people are doing well, even doing wonderfully, but I don't think that equates to instant success for anyone who puts a game in print. (I could be wrong ... I haven't done it yet, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised when I do).<br/><br/>But as for games changing the world (more than they already have) ... I would love that to be true. In a way they already have. If you look at the world of today gaming, in every form, is more mainstream than it has ever been before. Fantasy movies (heck even dire ones based on D&amp;D) abound, computer gaming is normality, CCGs found their way into mainstream stores, even the term RPG (albeit referring to computer games) is now mainstream. I don't know how it is in other parts of the world, but where I live (in the UK) even the stigma is largely gone. I can mention RP to my colleagues and only get a tiny odd look these days, because they all know what RP is. Sometimes I stop and I look at Lord of the Rings in the cinema, and fantasy comics in the mainstream bookshops, and massive immersive computer games and I thank the powers that I live now and not in 1960 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>However those things are still not paper RPGs. There is still a gap. But getting people to cross that gap now is, I think, harder than it used to be. Look at the things RPGs can offer ... meet like minded people, WOW does it, play a cool character in a massive world, WOW does it, explore fantasy, every book and film does it. Heck most new avenues of gaming are far more accessible than tabletop RPGs. Worse RPGs are no longer new, or rebellious, or at the cutting edge of anything, they are things your DAD plays!!!<br/><br/>I wonder, also, if we (meaning a good percentage of Indie / Story gamers) have not responded to the mainstreaming of fantasy and roleplaying and gaming by becoming ever more obscure, so as to stay on the cutting edge. Some story games, of course, can work great for novices, but some, honestly, are as far as possible from the concept of "introductory game" as you could imagine; which makes attracting new people into gaming using them a little difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122641/#Comment_122641" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T06:42:16+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  6:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2008 7:32AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>(<b>Warning</b>..<br/>It cannot be the case, surely, that *every single* Indie designer is making a profit on their games, otherwise we would have stumbled on a super secret instant profit making formula.

If you don't factor in your time, and are willing to create the whole game, illustrations, layout and all yourself, and sell it as a PDF there are literally no costs at all that you need to occur. That is why almost all rpg publishers nowadays can make a profit. Even if you have a printed version, the up front costs are minimal with say, Lulu, and POD means you can happily buy and ship 10 books.<br/><br/>But, that profit in terms of both absolute amounts and return on time is very likely in 95% of cases to be very low indeed. VIncent has discussed over the Forge that he is up to about $60 an hour for his work on DitV - but he's top dog. I doubt that includes all the time he's spent online talking about it, or perhaps even at conventions, but I'd imagine that gets listed under "pleasure", even though it helps from a marketing perspective.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a full time gig, and want proper payment for the time you spend whether you are making a "profit" is neither here nor there if you don't factor in the time you spend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122644/#Comment_122644" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T06:58:30+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  6:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Eventually you get enemies, and they sit around in South America and rant incoherently about your game, insulting you and your loved ones for no readily apparent reason, andtheysell your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122647/#Comment_122647" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T07:24:34+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  7:24AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Pelgrane, what you say makes sense.<br/><br/>As I mentioned somewhere above I run a web based virtual-pet site as a hobby, and that attracts far more income than I suspect my RPG efforts ever will, but if I really factored in all the time I have spent on artwork, coding, troubleshooting, moderating and the rest, and counted them all as costs, then I would surely make a loss if I charged a fair rate for my own time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This is something I want to blog about and I don't really have the juice to write the whole thing right now, but in brief:</p>\n<p>Making a game is fun. It's really satisfying to see your ideas make your friends happy. As I often say, construction is a holy act. When you make <em>anything</em>, you necessarily come to a greater understanding of the way the Universe works, because there wasn't something, and then there was, and you needed to understand enough to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Making a game into a <em>commercial product</em> is another matter. A lot of games just aren't decent commercial products. They live in an overpopulated niche, or they're sold to the wrong niche, or the creator isn't sufficiently confident of them, or doesn't know how to communicate the cool part, or can't figure out who the game is for, or doesn't know how to make a book look good. These are all critical things! If you design a game that has these issues, either don't make it be a commercial product, or fix it! And fixing it is hard.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the IPR topsellers list.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Spirit of the Century</li>\n<li>Dogs in the Vineyard</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Century [Print+PDF]</li>\n<li>Primetime Adventures</li>\n<li>Don't Rest Your Head</li>\n<li>Burning Wheel: Revised</li>\n<li>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach [Book+Cards]</li>\n<li>Polaris</li>\n<li>AGON</li>\n<li>The Dictionary of Mu</li>\n<li>Shock 1.1: Social Science Fiction</li>\n<li>The Blossoms are Falling</li>\n<li>Dust Devils Revenged</li>\n<li>Cold City</li>\n<li>Dread</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Century [PDF]</li>\n<li>Bliss Stage: Ignition Stage</li>\n<li>Monster Burner</li>\n<li>Sorcerer</li>\n<li>Mortal Coil</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OK, we have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A game based around a meticulously and lovingly built community</li>\n<li>The first runaway Indie hit, doing things that no one else was doing at the time, from someone with the marketing savvy to first design "Kill Puppies for Satan" that came out in 2004.</li>\n<li>That frickin' game in the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> position again</li>\n<li>Another early indie breakout and the first one with a mechanic based purely on approval and an effective economy (unlike Baron Munchausen, which is fun, but has a problem with the feedback loop that decreases its effectiveness). 2005.</li>\n<li>Another game by that guy in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.</li>\n<li>Another game with a meticulously designed game and book who has gone to extraordinary lengths to cultivate goodwill both among fellow designers (who are happy to trade credibility with such a great guy) and his own players and customers. 2002.</li>\n<li>A game that reliably makes people laugh so hard they're banished to another room at conventions, twisting Lovecraft so hard it becomes a new thing.

The book looks frickin' hot, to boot. The designer, incidentally, has remarkable eyebrows, and maybe I should stop trimming mine so I can compete.</li>\n<li>A book based on the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2319&amp;Mode=like">#19</a> best seller's rules, with intense illustration and pages designed by the guy in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>. A runaway hit! Hooray! Maybe this is what you mean by "instant success". </li>\n<li>The first science fiction role-playing game ever (barring Cyberpunk the way that only Ben ever played it and Paranoia the way no one realized it was). 2006.</li>\n<li>Written by the guy from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> again, as a supplement for that product. He comes out with these at regular intervals to keep people excited and showing new ways to use the game. </li>\n<li>The first Western in our scene, innovating all sorts of stuff that we take for granted now. Originally released in, what, 2003 or something?</li>\n<li>The prodigal child of The Mountain Witch, adding in beautiful book design and one of the most enthusiastic game designers I've ever met in my life. And that's saying something.</li>\n<li>An innovative game with a hook that is both understandable and unusual. Not to mention one of the best covers of any book in history.</li>\n<li>GOD DAMN IT, FRED! DOWN IN FRONT!</li>\n<li>A game about giant robots and sex between teenagers. So, duh.

I'm a little disappointed that its supplements don't outsell the book, frankly, since they're astonishingly useful. Anyway, it's significant that it's required to play the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> entry, Dictionary of Mu.</li>\n<li>Remember those great illustrations in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a>, Dictionary of Mu? And remember that enthusiasm from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314&amp;Mode=like">#14</a>, Cold City? And the media savvy and access of... well, a bunch of those guys up there? Brennan's got those. 2006.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note how many of these games have been selling for years, some taking lumps and needing revisions along the way.</p>\n<p>None of this is by any stretch "instant success". This is a lot to do! If you're not going to conventions, if you're not keeping up with little bits of chatter on the fora and not interfering when it's not necessary, but popping in and being gracious and funny when it is, if you're not refining your pitch, your book cover, your layout, your illustration choices, your writing before the game hits the streets, then you'll get lost in the sea of other people, some making the same mistakes <em>and some grabbing the bull by the balls</em>. And most of all, if you're relying on your idea being a breakout the way Dogs in the Vineyard or PTA were, make sure you've designed something that well. And if you, like me, can't rely on your design being that kind of breakout success, then be prepared to climb your way to success over years. If that's not what you want to do, <em>do something else.</em></p>\n<p>So, yeah. No instant success, barring accessible, clever, and true innovation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122678/#Comment_122678" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T08:53:15+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  8:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2008 9:04AM by HinterWelt.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>(<i><b>Warning</b>... normal post which appears to have turned into sprawling stream of conciousness ahead</i>)<br/><br/>It cannot be the case, surely, that *every single* Indie designer is making a profit on their games, otherwise we would have stumbled on a super secret instant profit making formula. I know I have seen some people complain that some of their games get little or no sales, and not every designer (or game) is created equal. Its great to know that some people are doing well, even doing wonderfully, but I don't think that equates to instant success for anyone who puts a game in print. (I could be wrong ... I haven't done it yet, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised when I do).<br/></blockquote>\nHituro,<br/>I think you are looking at it from kind of a blind spot. The people posting to this thread are filtered by a couple of factors:<br/>1. They are doing some sort of promotion (or are not running a company and are posting from a fans perspective) and sharing it. This will most likely skew the results towards more successful efforts.<br/><br/>2. Failed companies tend to go away. Most folks who really fail at any business generally want to walk away and not talk too much about it. Mind, some do but the thread title may not draw them in.<br/><br/>So, yeah, folks posting in this thread may be seeing a lot of success.<br/><br/>Now, there is a not really well kept secret about the game business. It is all about business in the sense that you need to establish your distribution, promotion, production and understand the cash flow of your business. Really, a lot of that applies with any business but we're talking about the game industry. I know it is popular to say "Great game design sells" but really, it does not. Word of mouth about it might help but if there is no place to buy it, only your friends hear about it then and you do not have any money for production...well, your game will not sell.<br/><br/>See, I am of two minds. On the one side I am passionate about my games, the settings, my approach to gaming and gamedy-game-game. Of the other mind, I am all about business. When I started this journey, my first book was a POD. Why? Because I knew I could make the game profitable (BTW-I mean profitable with my time figured in) with that production method and the distribution model I was using. To date, Tales, fantasy heartbreaker it is, is one of our most profitable lines. Why? Because I was able to craft the production and distribution to meet the goals I set for myself and the reality of the expenses.<br/><br/>I can't speak for others but that is why every single product HinterWelt has produced has been profitable. Craft your business (and by that your promotion) with the same care as you craft your games and profits follow.<br/><br/>Bill<br/><br/>Edit to add: Yeah, what Pelgrane said. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122679/#Comment_122679" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T08:54:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  8:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>We ought to be sending him sales commission checks...</blockquote>Send him a copy of the game and a thank-you note instead. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(But then I'm evil like that...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122684/#Comment_122684" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T09:22:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  9:22AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the time spent and living wage stuff, check out <a href="http://www.chimera.info/2008/01/29/on-profit-and-creator-owned-publisher/" rel="nofollow">this blog entry</a> I wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122686/#Comment_122686" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T09:26:39+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  9:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua and HinterWelt, thanks for the responses.<br/><br/>I think my post was missing some intonation (as is usual for the internet). Of course I understand the hard work that goes into these successful games, and how much other factors, like good design, good advertising, good publicity and the rest work into things.

If I don't make a loss than that will be great, and of course I want people to buy my game, but I am doing it from a love of games, and a desire to take one of my designs through to publishing and seeing where that leads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122707/#Comment_122707" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T10:41:04+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 10:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2008 10:42AM by VBWyrde.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah you see, and I was thinking you were asking How could we go about making Indie RPGs wildly successful as in the hundreds of thousands of sales or more millions of sales region.  For that I think a cultural shift would be necessary.   Though it's possible, I think it would take more time &amp; energy (though not necessarily money) than most people have available.  Then again, I'm of the opinion that a cultural shift is badly needed at this point.   And I do believe that RPGs could provide a vehicle, one of many, but a darn great one, for that.   Anyway, as usual the drugs effected my limited judgement.   My suggestion is entirely impractical.<br/><br/>Conversely, however, I do think there are ways to make Indie Games sell better, and those would have to do with the marketing messages.   Right now I think we tend to be marketing to one another.   However, to make a broad success we would have to market outside our somewhat insular community.  Again I come back to messages to parents, high school students, jocks and hot chicks.   RPGs could potentially lose their geek-skin, but only if they are marketed as something more than just a geeky game.   Remember when computers were things for geeks only?   Well RPGs could, and maybe shuold, make a similar transition.   But how?   Well, one thing would be, like computers - make them easier to use.  Another thing, like computers (the PC anyway) - make them Revolutionary (remember how Apple sold itself in the beginning?).  And again, I fall back on the fundamental messages about RPGs which would need to open new doors into segments of the community that either don't know about RPGs, or think RPGs are somehow bad, or think that RPGs are too Geeky.   RPGs could be made, if properly marketed, to appear to be A Cool Thing.   Which of course they are.   Dunno.  Any of this make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

In the car: Me, my girlfriend, my good friend from high school, her partner in the theatre company. The partner in the theatre company is a hip, trendy girl: basically the epitome of Seattle's cool set. She wins awards for her theatrical productions.<br/><br/>The conversation in the car for some reason turns to the Amber game that my good friend and I played in High School. The partner is like "What's that? Is that like a role-playing game?"<br/><br/>And we're like "yeah."<br/><br/>And she's like "How does that work? Do you just cooperate on telling a story together?"<br/><br/>And I'm like "Well, not exactly. If you put it that way it's more like an exquisite corpse. In a role-playing game, each person has a charge of different parts of the story. Usually each person has their own character, and one person doesn't have a character but controls most of the rest of the world. So, in an exquisite corpse, I might say 'bob went into the room' and then (my girlfriend) says 'bob saw a tree there' and then (my good friend) says 'bob was surprised.' But in a role-playing game, (good friend) might say:"<br/><br/>Good friend: I go into the room.<br/>Me: There's a tree there.<br/>Good friend: A tree? How surprising!<br/><br/>And the partner was like "wow, that's cool, I'd really love to come watch you play sometime."<br/>And I said "yeah, sure, I do casual games on most saturdays, let me know and you can come by and watch or participate."<br/><br/>Note the complete lack of any disdain for a totally geeky activity, described as a totally geeky activity.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122723/#Comment_122723" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T11:21:16+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 11:21AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2008 11:27AM by misuba.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I realize that most of you old-fogies haven't been in touch with popular culture since high school, but: Geeky is cool.

Because a big part of the alleged geeks-taking-over-pop-culture thing has actually been the fragmentation of pop culture. But I digress.)<br/><br/>What we're trying to promote, I think, is participation in an activity. Not necessarily membership in a culture or subculture. People might perceive geeky as cool, but that isn't the same as being driven to participate. In fact it may work against it.<br/><br/>[Hey, cross-posted with your elaboration. So: theater people, yes. We have an in there. The exquisite-corpse thing is good. I like the long-form improv explanation, too, as is perhaps <a href="http://story-games.com/codex/" rel="nofollow">obvious</a>. But in the end, I think the largest part of your success there was you weren't talking about a very geeky game.

People commit their time to all sorts of things, regularly, with the same people, for stretches of time. Baseball practice, ice hockey practice, the bi-weekly golf game, poker night, family board game night, family movie night, bowling league, band practice, Sunday dinner, Saturday morning WoW, date night.<br/><br/>I'd be willing to bet that many, if not a majority, of American families spend four to eight hours or more sitting in front of a television together week in and week out.<br/><br/>I don't think it's that unreasonable to expect that people can get together with a handful of friends for a few hours once a week or once every other week or once a month. I expect that if they really wanted to, most people could make it happen. Of course, maybe your time with those friends is better spent doing something else. That's perfectly reasonable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122741/#Comment_122741" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T12:03:27+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 12:03PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Baseball practice, ice hockey practice, the bi-weekly golf game, poker night, family board game night, family movie night, bowling league, band practice, Sunday dinner, Saturday morning WoW, date night.</i><br/><br/>All of these things (with the exception of band practice) do not collapse if one person doesn't show, or if an extra person shows up.

Pregenned characters to aid in prep time.<br/>2. Short adventures (20-30 pages) that read like a cross between stories and tech manuals.<br/>3. Short rules sets that people can internalize quickly.<br/>4. Character sheets with the mechanics on the sheet.<br/>5. Adventure meant to be run in 2-4 hours.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, it is like time spent on a party, playing a game (wow, yeah, the same <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) or any other hobby. Yeah, if one person does not show up in some games, that screws things up, unless you have pregenned set cast that people can take over or drop depending on attendance. In this way, time and availability become much more flexible.<br/><br/>And just to be clear, I agree with some of your points. I think a lot of the issues though, could be solved within the existing framework with a bit of clever rearrangement.<br/><br/>Bill<br/>Edit: As others have hinted at, I would add, if you get people constantly rescheduling on you it means they have somethign better to do. So much of this hobby has to do with the skill of the GM/the chemistry of the group. If members aren't showing up it is because they don't want to make time. Yeah, death in the family, illness, and the like set aside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122758/#Comment_122758" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T12:37:33+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 12:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill: Yes, if you make adjustments to the existing game frameworks, the games get more palatable.

While some modern story games are great for the whole family, some push their players to explore difficult or painful areas of real life, providing a creative lens through which current events, interpersonal relationships, or deep emotions can be examined in a safe context.<br/><br/>Today on Oprah, we meet some of this new movement\u2019s top-selling designers and ask them to explain what they\u2019ve brought to the table that\u2019s different, unique, and even revolutionary. We\u2019ll get to see how these games are played, using myself and members of the studio audience as demo players. And we\u2019ll be sending the members of our studio audience home with a copy of every game we discuss today! *cheers* *outro*<br/><br/>Recommended Guests:<br/>Vincent Baker; Dogs in the Vineyard, \u201cGod\u2019s watchdogs in a West that never was.\u201d<br/>Rob Donoghue, Fred Hicks, and Leonard Balsera; Spirit of the Century; \u201cClassic pulp fiction the way it was meant to be played.\u201d<br/>Matt Wilson; Primetime Adventures; A TV series game which is a perfect \u201cmap\u201d to story gaming for TV viewers.<br/>Ralph Mazza and Mike Holmes; Universalis; \u201cThe Game of Infinite Stories.\u201d<br/>The above are recommended because (a) their top-selling games have the best potential for broad, popular appeal without the past stigma associated with the likes of D&amp;D; (b) they are very active with customer support in online communities; and (c) they are consistently pleasant and coherent in their interactions and speech (those I\u2019ve heard).<br/><br/>Talking Points:<br/>Creativity and freedom to explore; catharsis.<br/>Affordability as compared to one night at the movies.<br/>Family time that's not TV time; bonding.<br/>Intellectual stimulation and (sometimes) historical education.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p4">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5430%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5430%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Indie Promotion Sucks - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Indie Promotion Sucks - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="David, that cracks me up.

Before talking about mainstream marketing, we should make sure we're producing something that the mainstream can enjoy.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben</blockquote>\nBen,<br/>Sorry, I was one step behind you. I was discussing in the original context of the thread. Personally, I think we could have an entire and separate thread dedicated to your topic. To me, it is related but only distantly to promotion and marketing.<br/><br/>That said, I will bite. <br/><br/>The issue I have is that the some of the barriers you describe are somewhat broad and overcome in certain conditions, and relatively simple ways at that. This does not mean they all are. Some aspects are fundamental to the game. I mean, we could design something that does not represent an RPG (and no, I don't want to have that conversation) that is a 15-30 minute game like monopoly. Some of my games are actually designed to fit together with board games of the same genre in order to ease non-rpgers into the playing the rpg. To me, the main reason RPGs are not mainstream is the lack of funding and promotion as a game. Honestly, I think any company short of the top 4-5 that were suddenly thrust into every Walmart, Target, Bookstore and game store would collapse under the demand. There is your problem. If a game is in front of buyers, and you can package it properly (not saying any are or are not) then you will get buyers. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying abandon all other modes but look at your own example. It is not a case of your friend being repulsed or saying "geek game" it is a case of "what is that?". If people are aware of games nowadays, it is usually either "Like DND right?" or "I didn't think anyone played that anymore".<br/><br/>Now, it could be argued we are sayign the same thing (and we might since I type this through a hell of a sinus headache) but I think the difference is you would like to show the world how different from their perception RPGs are while I would like the whole world to have a perception of what we are.<br/><br/>Now, we could attend every con vaguely related to gaming or setting genre and try for converts there. We could try to get a cartoon going again to promote a genre or system. We could spend a crapload of cash on a multi-media ad campaign. We could do all of the above. I know HinterWelt does not have that kind of cash. However, I personally do a lot of going to local book stores and selling my books with a pitch. And not necessarily game stores but standard B&amp;N and Borders stores. I do not see just the fringe society. I am talking about soccer moms and working class dads and kids who think math sucks. I pitch them my games and  some times they walk but a lot of times they stay and listen. I emphasize play like Monopoly and Sorry or Trivial Pursuit. I don't know what other folks pitches are like but this one really talks to the base perception (assuming they have one) of bad==DND. I cannot tell you how many moms will kind of go "Hmm, that isn't demon summoning, its just math and rolling dice".<br/><br/>To sum up, I think it is not so much a "Repair our image" as a "Build our Brand". By brand I mean RPGs. This comes back to the original topic of the poster, promotion. <br/><br/>Of course, all the above is just my experience with the subject. I am soooo open to other folks experience and convincing me otherwise.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122821/#Comment_122821" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T16:29:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  4:29PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to pipe in and say that this is *exactly* the kind of rambling brainstorming I was hoping to see.

I see these games as an opportunity to teach story-telling and creativity skills, something I do as part of my living. As the blind leading the blind, I can personally speak to the hurdles in the way of connecting in-person rpgs to 'the mainstream'.\n<blockquote>The issues are:<br/><br/>1) RPGs require social organization which is absolutely insane. Getting exactly the exact same group of people together regularly for 4-6 hour stretches? Jesus fuck. I have no idea how any of us get this done.</blockquote>\nWhen I read the opening sections of Polaris to a group of players, the several hours commitment of a half dozen plus sessions of play caused one player to express disbelief, even when I tried to explain that you could just play a single session. Others didn't react so badly, but it definitely remains an issue for some, <i>at least until the games really justify the time commitment</i>. Which leads to some of the more pressing issues...\n<blockquote>2) RPGs require intense creative, intellectual, and logistical commitment. Most people, if they have that level of creative and intellectual drive, do things like pursue theatre, write books, etc. Things which might eventually get them acclaim, profit, or groupies. That aside, many people just don't have that level of creative energy.</blockquote>\nTrue. So I've found that the game itself needs to 'get out of the way' as much as possible during the learning curve in order for folks to still have creative energy for the game itself. In trying to learn Polaris, most of the players had raging headaches at the end of a very short first session (that never saw a sequel). This frustrated me to no end, as I see a tremendous amount of gold in Polaris' structure, but learning it proved incredibly difficult for all of us, and eventually took the wind out of our sails. Even Primetime Adventures created this effect, though to a far lesser extent, and we managed additional sessions beyond the first.\n<blockquote>3) RPGs are presented in a stupidly hard to learn format.</blockquote>\nYES. Who cares if you put this games in every bookstore in the country? Nobody could play them without help, or extremely generous, faithful, and cooperative players, high on vicodin.\n<blockquote>4) RPG texts are often totally impenetrable, even to a committed learner, without prior context.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.\n<blockquote>5) RPG players are generally ashamed, and thus make their hobby out to be something fetishistic and shameful.</blockquote>\nNot such a big deal for me, as what passes for 'RPG' on computers I personally find so juvenile and unsatsifying that I just call these games 'story games' or 'storytelling games' and expect folks to accept them as such. No offense to those WoW fans out there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>6) RPGs are still deep in the embrace of the wargame, which is its own pursuit, also awesome, but really doesn't necessarily need to be a part of ours (what if we could have the peanut butter without the jelly?)</blockquote>\nSure, I've found enough story game designs such as Polaris, PTA, 1001 Nights, and DitV, that I don't worry about this.  Learning to play even one of these games well suffices as a challenge for the present. I think the first session of Shab al-Hiri Roach and Polaris at one game night (I had about 8 people attend) drove away about half of the players out of sheer intimidation. So I've acted much more cautiously about the complexity of games I offer, sticking to PTA and 1001 Nights probably.<br/><br/>So my question: When will designers start designing games so that a newbie can feasibly and ENJOYABLY learn to play them, without downloading dozens of cheat sheets and slumming around the internet for weeks? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I mean these questions and comments in the most supportive way possible: I love the story games that the whole indie scene has made, I love their potential. I just wish they treated newbies more empathetically, and made learning them fun too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122831/#Comment_122831" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T17:11:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  5:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's another thing that you may want to consider that was mentioned (by me, yeah) at the Game Design Panel during DexCon 10 last summer that at least one person (Rob D) thought was an important point, though it gained little traction at the time.  So I'll take a chance and repeat it here for the sake of discussion.<br/><br/>A lot of Indie designers appear to think their audience is players, but it may not be.  There's a good chance that the the target audience is other gamesmasters, and the reason I think so is because as far as my sense of things tells me, its gamesmasters who would be more likely to buy new games and introduce them to their groups rather than the other way around, on average, as a general rule (maybe).  I have no market data on that.  But its a hunch.  Now I realise that this may not be a popular viewpoint around here, and I'm probably shooting myself in the foot (again) to mention it.  But, I'm willing to take some risk to present where I'm coming from to you folks, and if the fallout is bad then sobeit, I'll have to take my lumps.  But anyway, I can tell you what you probably already know... there's a lot of GMs who play traditionalist D&amp;D who have, over some period of time, apparently taken high umbrage at some of the "rhetoric" that is perceived to have emanated from the halls of the Indie Revolution.   And, that coupled with some of the resistance many gamesmasters innately have to changing the creative agenda rules of story ownership... there's been some pretty negative feelings across the aisle as it were.  Now, I was happy to be able to sit in on a question and answer session between Luke Crane and the vociferous folks at theRPGSite (please don't shoot!  I am not a spy!  I did not come to subvert, invade, proselytize or make converts!  I came because Tim, Willow and Rob recommended I check out your scene!   I am totally Neutral and Agnostic on Creative Agenda!  Please believe me!   Don't shoot!   I'm unarmed!   Honest!) and I thought that that thread showed at least some potential to break new ground on both sides of the debate in terms of openness, and the realisation that neither one side nor the other side are a seething bunch of vipers plotting the destruction of humanity... but instead its a lot of creative high energy folks with a hobby they love who are trying to get out there and have fun with it - in different ways.  So it is something you may want to consider, in terms of language used in your marketing efforts, and even in how you present your game designs to the RPG traditionalist and outer worlds.<br/><br/>Um ... ok.  nuff said I suspect.   You may shoot now.   (Mark puts on his blindfold and lights up a cig - - - puff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Like lots of people who GM regularly I have lots of game books, and many of them are not games I have played. I might *like* to play them sometime, if I had the time, and the players who were interested and all the rest. Think of them as aspirational RPGs if you will.<br/><br/>Unless I live somewhere with an unusual demographic, then experience tells me that most gamers who have ever run games are in the same boat. I expect to see a shelf (or many shelves) of game books at their house, and I also expect that they may never have played with a good portion of them.<br/><br/>Remember, playing an RPG is an imaginative act. I can at least half-play a game just by reading it and imagining myself playing it, and I am willing to bet lots of people do that. They buy games because the very act of reading them is enjoyable, and fills their minds full of ideas, even if they never actually get to play. So in that sense a well written game is sort of like catnip for gamers, it can be enjoyed alone as well as with others <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122930/#Comment_122930" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T06:41:26+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  6:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2008 6:42AM by Alex F.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>This thread has sort of gotten away from its initial context so i don't really want to further that derailing (not to say that very cool conversation hasn't come out of it, it surely has).<br/><br/>But for the record, Ben Lehman has really laid down the word here.

Promotion - in the sense of it being a separate activity than just being excited about what you made - sucks. It's a soulless exercise that either doesn't work, or works because you had the stomach to sell somebody something they didn't want. It is antithetical to the creative process.

They'd be right in this case: by not inserting the phrase "for me," and not specifying that marketing the things you love and are excited about is a good thing, I painted friends and business associates totally wrong here. I don't enjoy marketing, and I think it's easily used for evil, but I don't think it's "soulless" or bad.

I think it's very neat and lots of interesting stuff in there.   Thanks.  As for your beef with Promotion... I think I understand what you mean and part of me agrees ... but ...  I think I prefer to look at promotion as part of the process of getting my game out there (when I do).   I look at the development of the game (design, artwork, writing, testing, etc) as one of several important aspects of making a successful game, and not just "the fun part".   Promotion as simply another activity that also requires my creativity, energy, enthusiasm and joy.   When I am successful (if I ever am) at promotion and the game does well, I'm sure I'll get a happy charged up feeling from that, too (a the sweet smell of success).  I want my game to get out to lots of people because I think they will enjoy it, and I'm going to think of Promotion as this fun cool thing I get to do along with all the other cool fun things I get to do related to my game.   And I won't be just fooling myself about it either to justify my money grubbing capitalism... I think I will enjoy it because I'm going to make it fun and creative... Well, I'm sure going to try anyway.   And the purpose of Promotion, to me, is not to make money... the money would just be an indicator of success for me, and a provider of additional opportunities to so more fun cool stuff with my ideas.  The purpose of Promotion is to get the game out there so people can enjoy it.   That said, I have a ways to go before I get it to the publish stage, and I don't really know how I'm going to try to Promote it yet.   Certainly this thread has provided lots of interesting food for thought.   But however I do it, I can pretty much guarantee that it will be fun, creative, and hopefully make people think and go ... "wooooo... what's that?"  If I can do that even a little bit I'll be delighted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123052/#Comment_123052" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T11:10:52+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 11:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>ask a creative person at any company involved in making a product what they think of marketing. </i><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am, sadly, that hateful chimera who fulfils both roles for my employers. And yes, I can see exactly what you mean. If I wanted to create an event without consideration to the bottom line it would be a truly liberating experience. However, I need to put food on the table to feed the damned kids and pay Leisure Games for all your damned hippy games, so I have to take consideration to what the market requires. And yes, that does mean that sometimes we have to compromise the creative experience but I would rather have a venue filled with 2000 happy punters whilst looking wistfully at my plans for a renaissance in 80s UK indie music than have a room with 100 people rattling around in it feeling creatively fulfilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen looking at designing games like this that non-reliance on the income means that of course, you can sate your creative loins without a thought to the saleability of the product. However when you have finished the product and you want put it in people's hands you have to tell them right? And thats where marketing comes in. Marketing isn't a case of selling someone something they didn't want - its a case of letting the person know that they can access a product that they do want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give you an example - today I listened to an edition of the Independent Insurgency (nice 'cast btw Rob - nice to hear one with swearing for once!) with Judd on talking about 1st Quest. I knew about the game before ... roughly ... but I had always assumed that it was akin to FirstQuest. I had always assumed that it was a beginners game and not really been interested. Now, having listened to the podcast, I am interested. Thats promotion.

Nixon</cite>I am not some sort of weirdo firebrand on this: ask a creative person at any company involved in making a product what they think of marketing.</blockquote>\nAs a creative person at a company that makes games: Marketing helps make sure our games sell. Marketing also plays a big factor into killing projects that they think won't sell. Often they are right. Often they are wrong. The people who work in marketing have a priority which is to make sure we make stuff that makes money. And part of that is to make sure people hear about the game, so the ones who do want it, know they can buy it.<br/><br/>Marketing at a company comes in two flavors.  There's the marketing department, which does a lot more than just marketing, and then there's the process of advertising.  This thread is about advertising.  Marketing departments often do work against creation, because they control how much you can spend on a project, including whether to spend anything on a project. So, projects proven to sell (sequels, franchises built on existing IP) are more likely to get money because they are less risky. But that's all besides the point because that's just how entertainment industries <i>tend</i> to work recently. There's a lot of successful entertainment makers who focus on creation as a priority, and yet they still pimp their own horn without a problem.<br/><br/>Promotion is not antithetical to creation.  It's different. It's maybe even completely unrelated. But it's not in opposition to it. And if you think it's antithetical... I've seen a ton of indie games with ads in the back.

When I wrote my first post on the first page, I was really passionate about it. I mentioned to my fiancee that I had a moment of clarity, I could see myself as an indie marketting guru. Beyond showing friends games that I love, beyond putting the word into books or podcasts, but buying up TV ad spots or making up flyers, or organizing demos and education in local gamestores, libraries, public access, whatever. It's out of love, but I'm not involved in any published RPG design, so it would be third party and all that, not really different than hiring a firm.<br/><br/>The fact is, you are jumping the gun by a huge factor.  We have close to zero marketting for indie games. I doubt even WotC could be described as soulless marketting. I know for a fact at the big video game companies I've worked at (companies who, on their own break a billion dollars a year) the marketing department is populated by at least some people that love games. The only thing that makes them soulless is the corporate machine that they have to help operate. I can count on one hand the number of indie publishers who has more than a single person in the "company," much less a corporate machine.<br/><br/>It would be awesome if the thing we had to worry about, is how story game marketting has gotten soulless.  God, I would LOVE to have the community have that problem.  As much as I hate the Hollywood entertainment model that's spread everywhere, the several billion dollars flowing through movies is the only thing that makes that level of soullessness possible.  And yeah, we get a bunch of high profile crap, but then we also get gems that are truly worth treasuring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123127/#Comment_123127" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T14:33:10+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  2:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so maybe there are loads more players than just readers in this community ... that's great, but are you (no specific you here) only selling to those people, or do you want to reach others? I'd think you'd be happy to sell to the readers too, because readers become players if your game sounds interesting enough. If your game sounds boring to read (as implied above) then why on earth would someone who bought it go to the trouble of playing it? Of course we have APs and word of mouth and the rest to promote how awesome games actually are, but that shouldn't be a substitute for a game that makes you want to play it from reading it.<br/><br/>Clearly I am in a minority though. I don't think I've ever owned a game I haven't enjoyed reading, even though I wouldn't want to have played many of them.

I'm a consumer.  I want other people to buy your games so I can play with them.  No one is buying your games.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, a thousand people bought the game last year.  That means that, assuming they are all in North America, there are perhaps three people in my city that own a thousand-customer game.  For all intents and purposes -- where my intent and purpose is to play -- that's no one.  It's cool that you like to make games and that you get a chance to play them with each other, but if you're interested in someone else playing them (and that's scary, I know), you need to find a way to get it to them.<br/><br/>As for players and readers, it should be obvious from the above that no matter how much I'd like to play, a promotional strategy that puts three copies in my entire city over the course of a year means I am a reader almost all the time.

They are both hobbyists. As a hobbyist, I have no desire or obligation to try to sell more copies of my game.

That's an ok outcome with me.<br/><br/>Still, I understand how wanting to play a game and not being able to is frustrating, right?

In the city I live in, I've met plenty of people who specifically don't want to play non-traditional games because they identify as traditional roleplayers. That being said, it seems like the best policy would be to round up non-roleplayers to play. And non-traditional games are, in my experience, much better at appealing to non-roleplayers than traditional games (my father thought A Penny For My Thoughts sounded cool; you'd have to have grown up with my father to understand the magnitude of that statement).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123193/#Comment_123193" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T21:57:22+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  9:57PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As others have said, RPGs sell the way they do because of the size of the market. When you grab a market estimate and divide it by your projected gross, interesting things happen. If you divide it by *somebody else's* projected gross, it gets even more interesting, even if you use rough numbers.<br/><br/>So if you want to sell more than the standard number of copies for a success, you must:<br/><br/>1) Create something that takes the existing market by storm.<br/>2) Create something that expands the market, or creates a new market.<br/><br/>"Indie" games collectively do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> -- and ironically, supplement treadmill dynamics seem to have helped quite a bit, given that the core community really treats them like one game line. Little indie games seem to do what WotC hopes the D20STL would: provide continuing focus on the brand without the leaders having to spend any money.<br/><br/>They do not do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. Designers talk about it, but it's still the same guys who hated their D&amp;D or Vampire game or something. And of course, most of the marketing is focused on the existing community. The market is so small that this can be effective without much effort, but it can also backfire, because people get annoyed once the  promo posts and fanspam reach a certain density. This should be a familiar sensation, because it's what happened to White Wolf.<br/><br/>I think the primary problem at this point is the perception of a closed community. Roleplaying is more successful than it's ever been; tabletop RPGs, not so much. The difference is that other roleplaying modes are open communities by virtue of an online platform and either sheer size (WoW) or an invitation to play with no speedbumps, such as purchasing and learning a rules set (journal/forum based fan RP, which people don't talk about nearly enough).<br/><br/>A game's design is not a particularly big deal. There is no magic system or method that will make new players play your game, and not another. I could tell you why this misperception exists, but I'm not permitted to do so. I've introduced and run a traditional RPG for total non-gamers in a 15 minute span, and the concept of protagonism was irrelevant. Sheer complexity is the only limit, and even that is only a matter of time. For Aeternal Legends, I worked with a non-gamer to get her to the point where she led the group in about half an hour. Mage? Same amount of time, though I didn't have to make characters then.<br/><br/>When introductions work, it's because of:<br/>1) The sense that the GM/organizer really wants the players to have fun.<br/>2) A staggered introduction to concepts and systems.<br/>3) Immediately introducing a cooperative environment.<br/>4) Applying the cooperative dynamic to help a player through stalling points in decision-making.<br/>5) Applying game systems loosely and establishing this as a standard practice and not "training wheels."<br/>6) Not wasting time with people who don't really want to participate.<br/><br/>I remember what I posted about the 15 minutes thing way back, it was critiqued on the basis that I was working with people who were naturally inclined to play along. I was amazed; why the fuck would I want to push something and people who weren't interested? But you do get people who want to force the idea of playing a certain way, and people who want to make a game conform to their expectations. As in all marketing, one of the tough decisions -- and one of the rewarding ones -- is identifying people who are not your target and not serving them. <br/><br/>You get the odd jackass who thinks they're punishing you by telling you that they won't buy your stuff, but they're a waste of time in the first place. Accordingly, when someone like Gareth is the way he is, consider that, well, he knows that the people who are really pissed off with him would never spend a dime on his stuff in the first place. You will still catch these people, but not through direct outreach. They'll end up playing and buying because others -- the people you do want -- are doing it.<br/><br/>So decide who you really want to reach, help them have fun and know more if they're receptive and really, don't bother with anyone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123196/#Comment_123196" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T22:12:59+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 10:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>an invitation to play with no speedbumps, such as purchasing and learning a rules set (journal/forum based fan RP, which people don't talk about nearly enough)</blockquote>\nWow, does this ever not get talked about enough.

In the city I live in, I've met plenty of people who specifically don't want to play non-traditional games because they identify as traditional roleplayers. That being said, it seems like the best policy would be to round up non-roleplayers to play. And non-traditional games are, in my experience, much better at appealing to non-roleplayers than traditional games (my father thought A Penny For My Thoughts sounded cool; you'd have to have grown up with my father to understand the magnitude of that statement).</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm not going to argue that this doesn't exist, but it sure is a pain, right? As someone who loves role-playing games, but obviously sees that different ones play different, I really hate this division of people into one camp or the other.                        </div>\n<div

Or at least not necessarily true. Long before he showed up here and - very gallantly, I thought - expressed contrition for some stuff he'd said that had truly pissed me off (not that he said it directly to me), I was loading up wheelbarrows of cash and dumping them on his desk yelling "More, more you magnificent bastard!!" Just because someone is a dick online - briefly, or as a career ("like you have, JDC" "what?" "nothing.") - doesn't mean they can't or won't produce good, solid, fun gaming material. Even if I do get pissed off at something someone says, I separate my personal feelings from the business transaction I enter into with them. <br/><br/>I'm just going to destroy their game anyway, and so are any other customers that use it, so why care about their feelings? And if I don't care about their feelings when I play their game, is it not fair and just that I don't care about mine when I buy it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123253/#Comment_123253" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:12:00+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I totally agree about the division.

A culture that is cultivated by designers/players within "indie" game community?<br/><br/>2. A perception of the customer based on preconceptions?

If I understand you correctly, you are saying<br/>1. These games are designed using certain concepts.<br/>2. These gamers do not like those concepts.<br/><br/>Then Joshua AC Newmen posits<br/><br/>3. These are not my customers.<br/><br/>This is an important aspect of marketing. Identifying your market is vital. However, it is often easy to fall into "These people do not like my game so they aren't my market" without the very vital "but these people like other products like my product". Alternatively, do they not like your product or do they not like the "indie" brand. Meaning, do they know your game or have preconceived notions of what your game is like. It is easy to say "I do not like Monopoly so I wont like Star Wars Monopoly". Your product may fall into "Yeah, it uses mechanics that are the same to game x, do you like game x?" The customer may respond "Yeah, I hate having to come up with my own story". You need to know that your game does not use any player story elements, whether the other game uses them, and if the player is informed. He might not like your game for turly spurious reasons. You make the conclusion that these "trad" gamers are not your market and you will focus on "indie" gamers. My prefered approach is to spread the love. Anyone interested in gaming I try to connect with. I also target beyond the "RPG" market for all manner of similar but complementary demographics. Again, narrowing your market can be a strategy but you need to make that choice carefully.<br/><br/>So, Hituro, who are your market if they are not trad role-players? Role-players looking for something more? You narrow your market considerably in doing so but this is a valid answer. And by trad role-players do we mean "players of the old style that will not change". That sounds a lot like "I don't like this game so it is indie, but I like this game so it must be trad". Now, I have wandered far ahead and it may sound like I am putting words in your mouth but really, I am just positing here. <br/><br/>I just want check if we are falling into the "If they are cool, they will play my game" or the "If they don't like my game then they aren't smart enough to understand it". This is a part of marketing that some folks forget. Designing products with appeal, determining your market then advertising at that market. It would seem that ignoring any role-player is a bad move in this market. Mind, that does not mean designing a product that addresses all role-players styles, preferences and desires. I don't think such a product would be possible. However, it is important to know who your product will appeal to.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123371/#Comment_123371" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T10:39:18+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 10:39AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: HinterWelt</cite>So, Hituro, who are your market if they are not trad role-players?

I've met some story games who are interested in Solipsist, and trad games who are interested, and some of either persuasion who aren't, so I'm not defining my market as one or the other.<br/><br/>However going back to the topic of Indie game promotion in general there really seems to be a 'brand' that has been created in people's minds, even though banner of Indie (or story) games contains a vast variety of titles and gaming formats with vastly more differences between them than most 'trad' games. Some people will buy games from the 'Indie brand' just <i>because</i> they are Indie, and I think some people sell to that brand identity.

Clearly, the communities are relatively different and will only recognize each other as kindred cousins if we start building more bridges between them, making tabletop and online freeform more similar in the process.  And that means viewing these people as something other than potential buyers and players of our games.  So far, that's pretty rare.</blockquote>\nThere is a great deal of intersection between online fanfic-based play and WoD fandom, stemming in large part from the fact that some of the largest low-tech multiplayer RPGs are WoD games. WW's official flash-chat game had around 5,000 players the last time I checked. There are about a half-dozen independent games. They use the WoD RPG rules set with a house addendum, but the core play experience is pure text-based interaction. Consequently, there's a tremendous amount of crossover between this scene and the fanfic scene, with common slang, play issues and administrative techniques.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that this community has evolved beyond playing in other people's sandboxes to include remixes and wholly original settings. I've done some professional work designed to specifically appeal to this scene with the Venice Chronicles, but unfortunately, that aspect of the project wasn't suitable for a project where the target was a very, very, very large number number of users. (Unfortunately, I can't be more specific.) I do see this changing with D&amp;D4e, because I think people will gravitate to the core strengths of the medium regardless of the available tools. That's what makes it relevant to this thread. Essentially, the first person to provide a complex chat interface that plugs into a specific game or game style that has vivid fiction and setting content, provides strong multimedia support, effective administration and delivers it all in a cost-effective package will probably do quite well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Do you think that he would ever hear of A Penny For My Thoughts if he didn't have a gamer like chearns for a son? I had a bunch of friends in college who would probably love Shock - they loved creating stories and loved the challenging nature of good sci-fi fiction, and even the ones I'm still in contact with will never hear of Shock unless I tell them about it. Removing me as a factor, I can't even imagine a situation where they would hear about it. The just don't cross paths with the circles that discuss it.<br/><br/>That's why indie promotion sucks. There's too many assumptions that the market is as small as it is because there's a limited appeal, and that word of mouth alone is enough to advertise, even though word of mouth only slowly expands to peripheral communities. Hituro points out the brand, which is a good thing to keep in mind. It's not just the indie brand, but the "role-playing games" is very effective at keeping non-roleplayers away (and even many role-players) from story games, under a mistaken assumption that they're all D&amp;D. And yet, we <i>know</i> that many of the story games have a broader appeal, or at least a completely different appeal, than most roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If you are referring to my "You need to be brilliant to understand my game" comment, that is just a stereotype of game designer thought. If I struck too close to home then I am sorry. I still think that is a bad approach and a good example of segmenting your market so that you exclude people you do not like. If it makes you feel better, honestly, I was speaking in general at that point. If it is another statement, I don't see it. Also, just to be clear, you may be a marketer with years of experience and this is below you but I have no idea who you are or what you do, so I need to make my statements as clearly as I can.<br/><br/>If it makes you feel better, I will remove all extra language. I am simply saying, if you have an rpg product, you need proper analysis of who you are selling to and what you are selling. If you (not "you" but the collective you) decide people who have interests that match what your product offers are not worth marketing to, then I believe you may be making a mistake. <br/><br/>A corollary to the above would be an accurate evaluation of your market as best as possible. This can be difficult but not impossible. Talking to game store owners, convention staff, and gamers can help. At some point (due to the lack of actual research) you need to make some guesses. I would not say that any segment of rpgers should be excluded. My games have been called more trad than trad. That does not stop me from trying to reach Indie gamers. I have had some success mainly with SA! but also with my more trad titles.<br/><br/>In the end, all I am saying is know your customers, know your product and base both on fact not emotion. To be clear, this is general advice and not directed at anyone.<br/><br/>Now, if what I am saying is upsetting you, I am sorry. I can't make it anymore neutral than the above.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

And, as a stereotype, unenlightening. You turned my <em>qualititative</em> assessment (whether you want what it does) into a <em>quantitative</em> argument (whether you're smart enough). It's not what I said or meant, but making it look like it is is an Internet argument technique that works great on RPG.net where you gain respect by cutting other people up.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p>Lemme give another example: <a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Agon</a> is a great game for putting heads on pikes, fighting with a spear in each hand, and wrestling with talking horses. It's not a good game for examining the causes and effects of demagoguery, theocracy, and the inherently fascist nature of warrior society when observed from a 21st century standpoint. If I play Agon and try to address that stuff, I will be disappointed, even though they're totally questions I can ask of the subject matter. If Jon had been <em>telling</em> me that I could address that stuff in order to get me to buy it, he'd be a liar and I'd tell people that.</p>\n<p>As it stands, he's very clear about what it does, made the game so it does it, he sells it enthusiastically, and lots of people talk about it. People buy it because they're exited about what it actually is. Failure rate is low, success rate is high, and it has nearly self-perpetuating buzz. The remainder of buzz is created by Jon himself just talking about it honestly and passionately.</p>\n<p>That marketing is kinda slow, to be sure. But the bang:buck is very high. There's obviously no shilling, since there's no budget (or reason) to shill. People who don't like something about the game just say so. People who like parts about it talk about it. Since that works on an exponential scale, five enthusiastic players turns into fifteen, which turns into forty-five... and all Jon has to do is make something good, give support to his customers, and be a presence online. Having a good sense of humor helps.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>if you have an rpg product, you need proper analysis of who you are selling to and what you are selling.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah. That's much easier said than done, though. How do you obtain that information? As for what I'm (we're) selling, I think we've got a pretty good handle on that.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>A corollary to the above would be an accurate evaluation of your market as best as possible. This can be difficult but not impossible. Talking to game store owners, convention staff, and gamers can help.

That's a big part of what the Forge is about.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>My games have been called more trad than trad.

What have you learned about marketing between these populations?</p>\n<p>Something I've learned is that a lot of people who like the focus of recent D&amp;D really like the focus of a lot of indie games. It's useless information if the players <em>identify</em> as "D&amp;D players" or "Trad" or whatever, but if they like what the games <em>do</em>, they'll be into other games that do <em>other</em> stuff they do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123936/#Comment_123936" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T09:37:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  9:37AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Thank you for sharing them. I think many Indie publishers can take advantage of at least some of those avenues. Oh, and don't forget podcasts, Myspace, and Youtube, guys. That's yet another avenue to reach potential buyers.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy<br/><br/>Thank you. I'll report back with more up-to-date data when Trail has been released.<br/><br/>As promised.<br/><br/>The Trail of Cthulhu launch was a storming success. Putting aside the the license and the quality of the book, I think the marketing worked very well. The drip feed of art work and snippets of info, as well as interviews and the pre-release Dragonmeet copies really helped build up direct sale pre-orders. Selling through IPR definitely brought in a big bunch of new customers. We even had a launch party, which was fun if not perhaps the best use of funds.<br/><br/>I think the banner on Alliance worked well to get the product in retailers' minds. A mix-up over a first-week distributor discount had the paradoxical effect of boosting sales (the product was in the retailers' faces) and the fact that we were low on copies has also assisted. I've yet to put banners on the websites I discussed, but I'll report back.<br/><br/>I won't know until I've tried something similar with Mutant CIty Blues whether it was just the product rather than anything special about the marketing, but we'll see. I suppose "make sure your game is as good as it can be" is rather redundant as marketing advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5430/indie-promotion-sucks/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5430%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5430%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
