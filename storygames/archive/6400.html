Moved from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6395" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, where Frederik Jensen asked for help translating his game from Danish into English (go help him!)<br/><br/>So here's the thing - there are many, many games out there that I want to play.  I hear about them, they sound innovative and exciting, but they are in Swedish, or Norwegian, or German, or Japanese, or Spanish, or Chinese.  Their authors aren't opposed to widening their reach, but translation is a huge pain in the ass.  I know that there are projects to do this in reverse - English to Chinese, English to Spanish - and I want to find out how they work and how we can do the same thing.<br/><br/>I'm imagining a massively distributed effort, probably using a wiki that atomizes the source text and translated text in various iterations, with talk pages used to comment and suggest wording, usage, idioms, and so forth.  Versioning, of course.  But before I go off the deep end, I'd really like to hear about what people are already doing.

The hard part is the game terms. I wanted game terms to be very close to natural language. This required some compromises.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Working through the text closely for translation also led to ideas for improving minor details of the original text (like reordering sections and making things more explicit). However, focus must be on translating the original game, not redesigning it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discussed the idea of a community translation with a Danish friend yesterday. He stated that there is a risk of uneven feel of the translated text. E.g. for a game like Polaris carried much by the mood of the fiction, he prefered an even translation of a poorer quality to higher but uneven quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of Danish gamers have made good games that they consider translating. However, for most designers, the motivation for finishing this job is low - the big reward is the premiere at a Danish game con. After that, most people feel that the job is done. Having a community like Story Games that can provide an audience for the second part is definately helping my motivation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn DK we have library sites with Danish scenarios (http://alexandria.dk, http://rlyeh.trc.dk/). It would be nice with an international library storing (free?) games from all over the world in several languages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141615/#Comment_141615" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T12:49:15+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 12:49PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure Keeton at <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/" rel="nofollow">1km1kt</a>wouldn't turn down a game in any language.

Zach brute-forces a page, then I go through and clean the text to flow in English with standardized game terms (that previously mentioned "continuity in tone"), then it gets passed back and forth a couple times until we feel that it's a transparent translation. <br/><br/>Repeat 180 times, and you have Ryuu Tama.<br/><br/>Right now it looks our next project will quite possibly be Tokyo Nova.We're having such a good time, we're already putting together other ideas, and Zach is flying to Japan in a month to clear out a FLGS back in Nippon. When we gets back, much merriment shall be had. There'll be more news on this front at <a href="www.j-rpg.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">J-RPG Talk</a>. I would think any linguistically inclined group could set up their own workbench group for bilingual folks, and grind out work appropriately. Also, if two groups are working on the same game in different languages, cross-polination of translation ideas (and promotion) could happen pretty organically, if everyone's willing to share ideas on a particularly long project. In the case of Zach and myself, we shouldn't need too much assistance between the two of us; but the workbench aspect of our site gives us a great feeling of a "safety net" should things get stupid. Are there other languages doing this same thing? <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Norwegian Style</a> seems to touch on the idea as well, translating Nordic roleplaying poems, to the great appreciation of those such as myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141641/#Comment_141641" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T16:46:40+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  4:46PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.

That's certainly true for any translation project in either direction - who controls what?  Does anybody profit?

This was done for several reasons, but one was the aforementioned purpose of maintaining tone and consistency in the choices. Later however, and even now, there were and are discussions about terms and their "proper" translations, for all the reasons known to all translators: languages are organic, complex, sometimes bizarre things; properly keeping a semantic value through them is quite an art. In this case, the beginner of the project keeps the last word regarding corrections to the final pdf version, but the wiki version is not controlled by him anymore.<br/><br/>Everything that Frederick comments, for example, is right on the spot: i remember the "should we fix it?" problem, the related "should we add to it?" (collected hacks and help documents around ),  the "i think this is an undiscovered errata" moments ( they were ), and on.<br/>And this is all from watching from a safe distance: Ren\xe9, Jos\xe9 or Guido ( the original perpetrators ) might expand this a lot more.<br/><br/>Editing, as i remember, was done directly in the wiki, but the forums were used to discuss doubtful or controversial changes ( in fact, if you go see the wiki you\xb4ll see the discussion pages are all in unused-red ); doing in forum threads more or less what the discussion pages are for in wikis, even in the form of discourse: "i\xb4ve altered X paragraph changing Y to Z because A; tell me if you agree with that" and all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dogui" title="Dogui"><img alt="Dogui" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dogui">Dogui</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141653/#Comment_141653" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T19:58:15+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  7:58PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I did the Donjon thingy mentioned above.<br/><br/>It did indeed start as a one man operation, mainly due to Donjon\xb4s style of writing and tone. I wanted it to be very consistent. There are other reasons but those are personal and not related to the topic. One that might be of interest is that I\xb4m a propective artist, and the pdf will be completely illustrated by me. Kind of a fun resume.<br/><br/>The "i think this is an undiscovered errata" moment was very cool. You go and check your Donjon books. You\xb4ll see that the cost for extra Magic Words in the text and on the tables does not match. And this was not in any Forge thread I\xb4ve seen. In fact Clinton seemed surprised when I mentioned it.<br/><br/>Regarding problems, with Spanish, there\xb4s one, and it\xb4s a biggy. I did the book in neutral Spanish. TSOY was done the same way. Spanish is a very complex language due to the amount of countries that use it. Spanish (from Spain) editions of games are somewhat alien for the people in Argentina o Chile. Many terms are used that are exclusively Spanish.<br/>That\xb4s why these two games were written in neutral Spanish. <br/><br/>But you know what? Neutral Spanish doesn\xb4t really exist. It\xb4s just a convention created for the translation of foreign movies and some books. And since the 50\xb4s, we pretty much accepted and embraced it. It\xb4s still no easy task. I did my best to write the text in neutral. And I\xb4m Argentinian, we talk NOTHING like neutral. <br/>This was possible because I payed extra attention, and because it was then revised and corrected by Ren\xe9, who\xb4s Mexican (and an editor, I might add) The SAS community has members from Argentina, Spain, M\xe9xico, Chile, and even Cuba. Once no one complains about an alien term, you know it\xb4s done.<br/><br/>The therminology was easy. Gamers are somewhat used to "dungeon crawling speak," so I could get away with many things. The genre itself is very American, so no worries.<br/><br/>These are free games, so we had no trouble either working on them or making then public (we had Clinton\xb4s blessings both times though)<br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141664/#Comment_141664" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T22:53:17+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 10:53PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even doing it by myself, one of the annoying things about translating Maid RPG is that I have to double-check both the original Japanese version and my translated version to figure out what I called something in English a couple months ago. Coordinating that across multiple translators sounds difficult.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Japanese RPG terms are actually relatively standardized ("attribute" is pretty much always \u80fd\u529b\u5024, etc.), even though they're not always used in exactly the same way (Maid RPG scenarios relentlessly use \u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc/"character" to mean "the Player Character(s)").<br/><br/>Japanese also has that thing where you can drop the subject of a sentence, but if you try to translate to English you have to figure out what it is or you wind up using passive voice relentlessly.

Did you edit directly into the documents or did you use talk pages?</blockquote>\nGorsh and Dogui said almost everything that needed to be said, but I think there are some other things I can add.<br/><br/>* The first thing you need to do is to translate the Glosary and Index. This is crucial, specially when coordinating with various translators. This might relate to Neko's problems with Maid.<br/><br/>*The notification of changes on a wiki is a very valuable tool. You can check the changes and change them back and forth as needed.The talk pages were rarely used. Discussion was held at a forum. That gives you the benefit of added traffic form people interested but not actively working on the translation.<br/><br/>*We managed to work without a project leader or coordinator, but I think this is a small miracle. You need someone to make decisions if you need some speed on the project.<br/><br/>*The main pitfall we found was lapsing interest. Two things helped a lot in overcoming this. First, we had a small report on the Community Portal with the percentage translated on each chapter. That gave us focus. Second, we organized small burst of community effort to advance the translation.<br/><br/>*A minor pitfall was our desire to refine the text. Our version of TSOY has 50% more text than the original edition. We left another 25% unused. It was hard to say "finally, this book is finished".<br/><br/>This last minor pitfall is important. We added a lot of examples to the game because there's no story-games community in Spanish, it was the first indie game translated (to my knowledge) and so we needed to explain things you might take for granted and you don't get the benefit of asking Clinton your doubts. And that's also part of the translation.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141728/#Comment_141728" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T10:37:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 10:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, that really is.
