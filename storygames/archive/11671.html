I am pretty sure that I am the enemy of both and so felt the need to elaborate.<br/><br/>\u201cFun is the enemy\u201d sounds pretty awful until you take two minutes to really think it through.  Jared clarified what he meant in that other thread and I agree with him.  It\u2019s basically a restatement of, \u201cOne man\u2019s pleasure is another man\u2019s pain.\u201d  I hope this is obvious and non-controversial.  <br/><br/>Attempting to maximize some abstract global-universal notion of \u201cfun\u201d is a pointless pursuit.  Instead you should focus on something concrete, real and specific and let others judge whether they find that \u201cfun\u201d or not.  If you absolutely MUST employ the word fun then I advise that you focus on maximizing your own personal idea of fun and allow like minded people to follow and be willing to let un-likeminded people walk away.  Constantly shifting around to please the most number of people puts undue responsibility on yourself (you become the \u201cfun god\u201d which often turns into the \u201cfun martyr\u201d) and it waters down the experience and overall fun to be had by everyone else.  In other words you compromise the quality of the real-world activity in the name of the abstract notion of fun.<br/><br/>\u201cAwesome is the enemy\u201d I think is more controversial but I think it is also consequently less universally true the statement about fun.  I personally would rather phrase it as Awesome is the enemy of Honesty.  Sometimes it\u2019s appropriate to value one over the other.  However, I find that valuing Awesome can often lead to unnecessary creative stress.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve watched many players struggle to come up with something \u201cAwesome\u201d to do when they in fact have a perfectly valid idea at the tip of their tongue.  Not only is that idea perfectly valid but it is often more honest and true to themselves as people because it comes from the gut.  I find trusting that gut idea often has a cumulative effect that leads to something truly magical over the long haul rather than a string of moment-to-moment \u201cAwesomeness.\u201d<br/><br/>Over valuing Awesomeness can also often very subtly shift focus away from shared creativity by introducing an almost unconscious element of social competition.  Rather than truly constructively building on each other\u2019s contributions the game becomes a game of \u201cone up\u201d-manship as each play tries to out awesome the previous player to score social points with each other.  Note: This effect can be harnessed functionally and produces some rewarding play *if* it is actually wanted and embraced by the group/game as a whole.  However, it can create unwelcome social pressure if the players are looking for something else out of the game.<br/><br/>And that is why I am the enemy of fun and awesome.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260293/#Comment_260293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T14:46:36+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  2:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2010 2:47PM by Graham.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything you're saying about Awesome is what I meant, in Play Unsafe, about being obvious.

I've seen both those two things you describe ruin good game designs and good gaming sessions.<br/><br/>So, it's excellent advice, and thank you for clarifying.<br/><br/>I DO think, however, that advice of this type is funny (but not unusual), in that its opposite may also be true. Like, you might see someone designing a game and say, "Your game sure is focused on what you're interested in. But have you considered how to make it fun for the other people playing it?" Or you might be playing with a bunch of folks who constantly answer questions like, "What do you do?" with answers like, "Well, I guess I'll tie my shoes, and then... I dunno, go to the grocery store?" They may need do some exploration of how applying dramatic principles to role-playing, envisioning a game as a theatrical event, etc, can improve their fun.<br/><br/>It's a question of realizing when a particular piece of advice is appropriate to your situation and applying it with wisdom. I don't see any point in debating whether Jesse's point is True in any sort of absolute sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item

just flat out trying to be awesome every time you have the spot light. I don't see Jesse's post as saying "things that are awesome and fun are bad." I understood the point to be that trying too dang hard to bring awesome to the table can often yield less awesome and less fun than playing naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261065/#Comment_261065" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T19:26:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:26PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thread title was tongue in cheek.  I think, however, the social phenomenon I describe are (a) real and (b) pretty clear in my original post.<br/><br/>On Fun:  The word "fun" is often used as a dismissive weapon.  "I just want games to be fun." -&gt; Translation -&gt; I'm dismissing the activity you are describing as not being worthwhile but covering that with a statement that on the surface is not-disputable (because seriously, who doesn't want fun?)<br/><br/>On Awesome: <br/><br/>1) People don't trust that the initial idea they have is any good or fear that it will be judged lacking in the eyes of their fellow players and so they stretch or reach for a "better" idea which is both unnecessarily stressful and often misses out on the longer term effects of simple honesty.<br/><br/>2) A competitive game of social one-up man ship can sometimes result from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as each player tries to out surprise or shock or excite each other.

Rpg.net had a bad case of it around 4-5 years ago though.<br/><br/>I have experienced 1, and one of the motivations for it is often you wonder if the game is going to continue next week or next month. In other words, you reach for the short term payout because you doubt that the group/game will be there a month or a year from now when the honesty will pay out. <br/><br/>There's also a degree of aim and timing here. I decided to run a comedy horror game, but started out too zany, so everyone, to respond to my zaniness, upped the ante and got zanier. Meh, no. That wasn't funny. What would have been funny was starting real and THEN escalating.  It wasn't a bad idea, I just made a mistake.  <br/><br/>Or maybe that's 2.<br/><br/>Anyway, fun and awesome are still your friends, it's just these behaviors that are bad. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261131/#Comment_261131" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T05:49:49+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  5:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 5:51AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noclue, the point of "I'm gonna make you awesome" is that everybody is doing it. It's a trust exercise. You relax and focus on others, knowing that they are relaxing and focusing on you. Still, if you see a good move for yourself you shouldn't avoid it - it should just be sort of unexpected, because you aren't hunting for it.<br/><br/>Jason Corley, I see the escalation of zany happen all the time in The Shab Al-Hiri Roach. The game works so much better when you start small and prosaic and then build, but the temptation to go big fast is very powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261146/#Comment_261146" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T08:03:15+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  8:03AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Okay then.
