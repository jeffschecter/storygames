This is giving me several ideas for what to do with the final version of the game. I will write about these in detail in the final book, but this particular one I have found quite helpful and wanted to share it with you.<br/><br/>During last week's regular session, we hit on the fact that coming up with new Authority Figures every week that were tied into the Friendship Questions was starting to get frustrating. We were coming up with great Friendship Questions and finding ourselves irritated by the need to shoehorn AFs into them. Kat (I believe) and I both independently and simultaneously arrived at the solution:<br/><br/>Create FQs and AFs separately at the start of each session. If you feel like integrating them, that's fine. You don't have to.<br/><br/>I found this to be very helpful when I ran the game last weekend at <a href="http://jiffycon.com" rel="nofollow">JiffyCon</a> Lowell '08, and intend to include the rule as part of the final draft and use it in upcoming games.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>PS: I hope to have a final edition of the game completed for <a href="http://gencon.com/" rel="nofollow">Gen Con Indy</a> '09, perhaps before. If not, I would be shocked not to be done by <a href="http://dexposure.com/" rel="nofollow">Dexposure's</a> Dreamation '10.<br/><br/>PPS: If you have any feedback, if you've run complete series of the game, if you have rules tweaks, if you played and hated the game (or loved it), please post about it or at least let me know. You can email me at my gmail account, which is at rob dot bohl.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182385/#Comment_182385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T10:24:12+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 10:24AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Theatrix and Bubblegum Crisis, Misspent Youth is finding a place on my bookshelf where I "go-to" for plot structure.

They didn't want to generate a setting, and characters, and the scenes. In the end, they trashed them all and decided on straight Panty Explosion so I would "stop pestering them" about it. They had a great time and perhaps they'll be more open to the new stuff I bring to the table. For now, I've just started a 4e Shadowrun campaign, but maybe I can talk them into it when there is a gap. <br/><br/>Anyway, please put me down for a preorder.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182412/#Comment_182412" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T11:48:10+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 11:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

I can perhaps understand not wanting to have responsibility in the scenes (and actually, as written, the GM has responsibility for this though it's expected the group will participate), but setting generation stuff is always fun in my experience. Do they have experience of setting-generation games and they didn't like how I do it in the game, or is it that they're just generally against that sort of thing?<br/><br/>I'll definitely announce publicly (including here) when I plan on doing a preorder.

Suppose your rules said that you have to generate the Authority by rolling a die for each aspect. Players say "That's not any fun. Why don't we just pick the aspects we want?" So you pick the aspects, or make new ones, and create the Authority. The game moves forward and the players feel, and are, empowered.<br/><br/>Evan Tormer (?) ran Mortal Coil at Origins with no setting at all. Everyone contributed to the setting and wackiness ensued. It "cleanses the palate" creatively but it's not something I could sustain every week. Perhaps a list of sample Authorities, with a bit of setting ephemera spelled out, would serve as training wheels for those of us new to story gaming.<br/><br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182447/#Comment_182447" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:32:32+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:32PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grant, the easy fix for you is to generate a setting that you think will compel them to play (I'm talking about 15-30 minutes of work here), tell them about it, then let them make characters in it. If they don't want to generate scenes, the game drifts pretty easily to GM-drives-scenes play. Just be ready to take your hands off the wheel when they want to drive. If they don't want to make up their own characters, fuck them in the eye.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182453/#Comment_182453" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:39:15+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. There's something I'm not getting and I think that text might keep it impenetrable to me. Perhaps this is something we can discuss at Gen Con. It may be that what they want runs counter to the way I want the game to be designed. I know this piece of the game works for the people I've played it with, but if there's a way for me to make it work for others, I'd like to accommodate them.<br/><br/>However, yeah, perhaps a few more example setting creations might do the trick. Maybe an entire example article (chapter) to supplement the examples that are already embedded in the text.<br/><br/>Thanks for trying, Grant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
