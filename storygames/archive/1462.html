                    So I'd been mulling over the question of establishing an element, then reincorporating it at a later point in the story, as in improv.<br/><br/>How do you make a system that encourages that?  How?  How?  It's such a complicated issue!<br/><br/>And, connected:  What are scenes that don't resolve an issue about?  Why are they there?  What do players get rewarded for in them?<br/><br/>Then this morning I thought "Hey ... what about if, instead of them just rolling dice based on the level of a card, they put a die on the card each time they refer to the issue, then when there's a conflict they can roll those dice by reincorporating the issue into the current situation?  So those early scenes are about them choosing where to place the resources they'll use in the eventual confrontations, of course."<br/><br/>Which ... y'know ... criminally obvious in hindsight.                </div>

                            That is brilliant.<br/><br/>A half-baked idea that I've been toying with is that when a player flags a trait in an establishing scene, the opposing player or GM immediately pays opposition dice for it, showing that it will come up again and be useful because now two people at the table are invested in it, although your idea is better because it rewards reincorporation.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I assume that as soon as you choose to 'reincorporate' the issue and roll its dice, those dice go away?  That seems cool.<br/><br/>It also seems as if you could load up an issue over and over in order to draw some other player into 'reincorporate' it.  Baiting them, as it were.  That seems super-cool to me.<br/><br/>Some specific questions: How do you get people to build issues up over time (rather than just rolling them all with only a die or two) without making people build them up forever (continually putting them off).  I'm actually okay with unresolved tension (the never reincorporating it officially), but how does that work mechanically?  You've got all those dice sitting there, and you like to ratchet up the tension, but you never resolve it properly because the tension is where a lot of the fun is (I'm thinking specifically of stuff like unresolved sexual tension in serial television, which is a lot of fun).<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Improv hat on...<br/><br/>That sounds like a good way to handle mechanically rewarding reincorporation.  Reincorporation is in and of itself enormously satisfying, particularly when unexpected, and in improv can happen on many levels - inside a scene, between two scenes, thematically unifying an entire group of scenes (the third beat in a Harold).  <br/><br/>Scenes that don't resolve an issue are *awesome*, because they form a de-facto offer you or other players can return to, reincorporate, and heighten.  A scene that resolves is a scene that didn't get edited fast enough.  Example:<br/><br/>I initiate a scene about my offensive body odor.  My partner runs with it and we edit before the issue is resolved.<br/><br/>Later, another scene, in which I find out that my body doesn't just stink - it's actually harmful, an odor so bad it makes your back hurt.  Everything about me is dangerously repellent - that's the game.  We've heightened but not resolved.<br/><br/>Later scene between two other people, completely unrelated, and my disgusting character walks in, says hello, and leaves, with the other characters reeling in agony in my stink-wake as I pass.  Maybe I turn around and ask them a question, prolonging it.  Maybe they drive me off, who knows?  There's nowhere else for that character to go, but I reincorporated and heightened effectively, and the inherent conflict will be resolved as I peak in the third scene.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>I assume that as soon as you choose to 'reincorporate' the issue and roll its dice, those dice go away? That seems cool.</blockquote>A little more complicated than that, actually.  Here's how I'm thinking I'll elaborate it into the system.<br/><br/>Each player has a color of dice.  You will have dice of many colors in your pool, ready to place on your cards.  If anyone (including you) narrates something that you (personally) think is a success for the character then you put a die of your color on the card.  If another player narrates something that you (personally) think is a setback or aggravation for the character then you put a die of their color (from your pool) on the card.<br/><br/>When you roll, the dice off of your card determine who wins.  But whoever belongs to the color that, <b>overall</b>, beats all the other colors of dice gets to decide whether the victory (whoever has it) is the final resolution or a mere set-to on the way to either final resolution or leaving the problem unresolved.<br/><br/>When you roll a conflict, the dice come off the cards, and are traded (winner takes loser dice, loser takes winner) except in the case of final resolution of an issue, in which case some set of dice (haven't yet decided ... winner dice?  loser dice?) are removed from the game forever.  The goal of the game is to be the first to get rid of all your dice :-)<br/><br/>And (stolen from TSOY) ... you can't place the same type of die on the same card twice in a row.  So either you've got to be bopping back and forth between two conflicts (all with the same color dice), or you've got to be doing a back-and-forth where you have successes and setbacks in order to use two different color dice.<br/><br/>I think that the game of placing the dice (which corresponds to the game of consciously <i>realizing</i> the interactions and how your character is effected others and effects them in turn) is going to be, by far, the main fun and focus of the game.  Resolving conflicts will just be the Maltese Falcon that draws people forward.<br/><br/>Playtest tonight, hopefully!                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Interesting, I was imagining something pretty different.  Something like this:<br/><br/>Each issue has a card.  Anytime a player references an issue, they can put a die on the card (don't know how I'd do colors here, but they could probably be worked in well).  When you get into a conflict you can choose to 'resolve' the issue and roll all the dice currently on it.  Anyone can choose to do this.  So you can load up an issue with your dice hoping to entice another player into resolving it because they need the dice.<br/><br/>That's pretty rough, but that's what I was imagining.  Which is pretty different from  your own take.  I gather that in your system a single player controls each issue (and thus only that player can roll it)?  Is it also the case that only that player can place dice on it, or can you load someone else's issue up with your own color in order to control whether it really gets resolved or not when it finally does roll?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I had similar thoughts along these lines last month, so I'll toss them into the mix.<br/><br/>First I had this vague thought:
<blockquote>Players have stuff they want to happen in the game written on blank cards. You write down a scene, a visual, a sound or action and the GM incorporates it into a narrative. When you bring out a card, the other players place tokens on it. Every time the GM incorporates a card into his narrative, he collects the tokens on the card and discards a token from all other cards presently on the table. Once a card runs out of tokens, it must be incorporated into the narrative, but the GM doesn't get any tokens for doing so. In other words, a card has to be put into the narrative when the tokens run out, but you can bring it in early and get rewarded with tokens for doing so. After you collect tokens from a card and complete your narrative, the GM duties are handed over to the person on your right. ...<br/><br/>I just thought it was cool to have these weird narrative bits down on the table with countdown timers on each of them. "Aw crap, that shotgun's going to have to happen soon. Wait, here comes 'a true love betrayed.'"</blockquote>
And then I spun this into a loose premise with a half-assed system:
<blockquote><b>CSI: RPG</b><br/><br/>The group is a team of CSI detectives putting together pieces of evidence in order to form a narrative of the crime and discover whodunnit. The players create the evidence by writing it down on cards.<br/><br/>"A bloody fingerprint."<br/>"A shattered window."<br/>"An elvis impersonator costume."<br/>"A bank withdrawl slip."<br/><br/>With each piece of evidence, an investigator postulates what happened at the crime scene. This is an adaptation of those quick "dramatic re-enactment" sequences on CSI. If an investigator takes a card while it still has tokens on it, he can spend those tokens to "tamper with the evidence." That is, to add twists to the other pieces of evidence, one token per detail. Any tokens you don't spend, you can keep for use as a foreshadowing/delaying tactic as described in the previous post.<br/><br/>If you don't want any more twists added to a piece of evidence, you can spend a token to "seal" the evidence. That means you actually <i>put the card in a plastic ziplock bag.</i> If you want to tampe with sealed evidence, you have to spend a token to open the bag plus spend the standard token to do the actual editing.</blockquote>
Not sure if this sparks any ideas, but I saw everyone riffing on this "writing stuff on cards" jam so I thought I'd join in.                        </div>

                            Okay, I've had the playtest, and I'm going to bubble a little.  Okay ... a LOT.  Executive summary:  Everything I thought might work worked, and in addition the synergy of elements drove us to things that were intensely satisfying.<br/><br/>Eric and I decided to just draw random (rather than choosing our elements deliberately).  We pulled two cards from each category, and got the following:  External:  "Your World is under attack" and "People are being separated."  Relationship:  "You don't respect me," and "You care more for someone else."  Internal:  "Why am I so flustered?" and "Why don't I stick up for myself?"<br/><br/>The setup:  Two young kids have been drafted as pilots in a giant-mecha war against crab-aliens.  Shima, is a cold, military, older girl.  Yuki, is a hesitant, blushing young man trying to grapple with his own feelings.  Shima trained Yuki.  She's fallen for him, but can't express it.  Yuki's convinced that nobody respects him, and is trying to summon the nerve to complain about that.  It's the night before Shima ships out to detached duty, somewhere away from the space station they've been defending and training at.<br/><br/>The "put dice on cards to prime for conflict" thing prompted me to start with a solo scene.  Shima is packing her few belongings into her space-robot ... neatly pressed uniforms.  A photo-booth slip of pictures falls out, with her and Yuki.  Reminders of better times.<br/><br/>Eric went with a scene we'd both be in, squaring up on the intersection of "Why am I so flustered?" and "You don't respect me."  Bzz!  Bzz!  Alarm!  We're under attack.  Yuki is too slow getting his robot started, and the deck officer chews him out.  Why doesn't he stick up for himself?  They launch, and Shima, who can't express herself in words, finds a good medium in high energy plasma, blowing away any alien that tries to attack Yuki.  He, of course, views this as proof that she doesn't think he can hack it.<br/><br/>Next scene, after the battle, when they're prying the battered Shima from her cockpit, Yuki is already gone.  He's stung, and doesn't wait to see if she's alright.  That was sad :-(<br/><br/>He goes off to his favorite sulking place.  When he's had a chance to reprime dice in another solo scene, I introduce the character Fea, an energetic and outgoing girl who drags Yuki off to play some video games.  Shima meets them in the hallway ... there is a brief set-to around the intersection of the stakes "Why don't I stick up for myself?" and "People are being separated."  We resolve those two:  Yuki doesn't stand up to Fea, and so she drags him off, leaving Shima all alone on her last night there, the words she wants to say dying on her lips.<br/><br/>Lots of stuff is still primed.  Straight on to more action.  Next scene, video games.  The screen flashes "Game Over" and Fea, the girl who always has a smile on her face, starts losing it.  Not loud and messy, just leaning against the game with tears pouring down her face.  Aliens are trying to eradicate the human race, and she can't keep up a brave front any more.  She wants to look to Yuki for strength.  We set a conflict right at the intersection of "You care more about someone else" and "Your world is under attack."  My stakes are that Fea and Yuki kiss, and Shima (coming to confess her feelings) sees that as she turns the corner and quietly flees before they spot her.  I win the stakes.<br/><br/>Just two conflicts left:  "You don't respect me" and "Why am I so flustered?"  I prime a little melancholy by having Shima all gearing up to ship out, determined not to even <i>care</i> whether Yuki shows up to see her off.  He doesn't.  She cares.<br/><br/>Then, Battle Claxons!  Back out into space.  The two of them compete with each other, with Shima unable to communicate how she wishes they could work together, and Yuki unable to play second fiddle to her any more, and in the end they can't get it together.  Ego and fear stand between them.<br/><br/>Hangar deck.  Same conflicts, different context.  Shima confronts Yuki about his "undisciplined behavior."  They get into a heated argument about who's done wrong to whom, all in the context of their trainee/trainer, kohai/sempai relationship.  I win, but refuse to resolve.  We come right back to it, immediately, with the cards empty and needing to be primed in action.<br/><br/>So we hit the same conflicts again, only much harder:  One after the other, we say terrible, painful things (and, instantly, each of us primes a die on the card, because we see and recognize them as terrible and painful ... and we're saying the things in order to be able to prime the dice, it's an orouboros loop).  Shima reveals that she saw Yuki and Fea kissing.  "Is that what this is all about?" Yuki asks.  "That's what this has <i>always</i> been about!"  We do Naruto-style flashbacks to their training days, first seen from Yuki's point of view (Shima is always pushing him, never satisfied with any progress he achieves) then from Shima's point of view (Yuki has the heart to rise to any challenge, even when it's not easy for him).<br/><br/>They feel something for each other.

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I concur that this sounds rocking.  Unfortunately, I don't have a good grasp of what happened <i>mechanically</i>.  How m any dice were going into a given conflict in any given scene?  How were the rolls turning out?  How did you eliminate dice from the economy and how did you trade dice so that someone ended up with your color?<br/><br/>I want to know how the mechanics made this coolness happen!<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Oh, hey, another question:  How was character 'ownership' handled?  I assume that one of you played Shima in every scene and the other played Yuki in every scene (as that strikes me as important for some of MB's stated goals), but what about NPCs?  Did any of them show up in multiple scenes?  Did any of them matter?  Were any of them played by different players at different times?<br/><br/>Dang I'm full of questions.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Okay, mechanics-wise, here's what we did.<br/><br/>Cards had paper-clips on them (starting with one on each card).  You couldn't put more dice on the card than it had paper-clips.  So you can only do so many introspective scenes before you need a conflict.<br/><br/>When you make a conflict you stake cards, and you also state rough outcomes.  Like, "I'm putting in 'Why don't I stick up for myself?"  You're putting in 'You don't respect me,' eh?  Well then, my desired outcome is that she treats you like a child, and you don't say a word about it.  Oh, your desired outcome is that you're so effective as a punching-bag, without sticking up for yourself, that she can't bring herself to treat you bad?  Cool."<br/><br/>First each card that is staked <i>instantly</i> gets another paper-clip.  So now there's some motivation to ratchet the tension up a little bit before the conflict is resolved (sorta like in Dogs, but lighter) in order to place that extra die on the card.  You roll dice and tote up (as described in my second post).<br/><br/>If the winning side had their card <i>full</i> (i.e. it had as many dice as paper-clips) then the conflict has the potential to resolve.  If less dice were rolled then the conflict is automatically deferred. The person whose dice-color got the highest total (whether they're the winner by dice rolled or not) gets to decide whether or not to resolve.<br/><br/>If the conflicts resolve then all dice involved in the conflict (as well as the cards) are removed from the game.  Bye!<br/><br/>If the conflict doesn't resolve then the issue on the winning side gets <i>another</i> paper-clip, and both issues go back to their owners.  In that moment they are empty, but it's not uncommon for people to be loading dice onto those cards <i>as resolution is narrated</i>, just saying "Oh!  That ratchets the tension ... and that ... and that."<br/><br/>Now the simple way to be unable to resolve conflicts is that you simply get to a place where you have more paper-clips then you have dice.  As it turns out, that wasn't actually our problem:  I had six paper-clips, and six dice, but they were four dice of Eric's color and two of my own.  Remember:  I can't play the same die color on the same conflict twice in a row.  The most of my dice that I could actually spend in was five.  Heh.  That's probably going to change when I revise how players use Motifs (a mutant hybrid of the past version's Seeds and normal RPG character-abilities) but I'm not getting into that just now.<br/><br/>The instant we failed to resolve the issues, Eric pointed out that it was still <b>possible</b> to resolve them ... we could propose a conflict and one side or another could totally bag on it ... spending just a token one die or something.  Now it wouldn't resolve <i>that time</i>, but that would put almost all of the dice in the game into one person's hands, rather than dividing them between two, and that would give them the potential to resolve.  Long-term I want to look at the end-game strategies implied there, and figure out what I want, but in this game we decided that neither of us was interested in that kind of hail-mary pass.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>Oh, hey, another question: How was character 'ownership' handled?</blockquote>Thinking back on it, I introduced and played both the arrogant deck officer (never named) and Fea.  So maybe I was playing the GM role, handling NPCs, as well as playing my own character.  Or maybe we were totally on an equal footing there, and Eric just didn't feel like creating characters.<br/><br/>It's certainly worth asking and thinking about ... I just don't have clear-cut answers for you.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Neat!  I've got even more mechanics questions for you!<br/><br/>Am I correct in thinking that:
<ul><li>No one 'owns' an issue, anyone can put dice on one as appropriate, and either player may pull it into a conflict.</li>
<li>Each player can bring only a single issue into a conflict, but if there were some sort of three-way conflict (with three players involved) you could have an issue from each player.</li>
<li>Both issues resolve if one of them does.  That is, as long as the winning issue is eligible (full), and the color-winning guy chooses to resolve that issue, then all other issues in the conflict <i>also</i> resolve no matter how full or empty they are.</li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of dice you can assign to issues in a single scene as long as you A) have the dice available and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> don't put the same die-type on the same issue twice in a row.</li>
<li>An issue that is brought into a conflict will gain one or two paper clips in that conflict.  Never more, never less.</li>
<li>Since a staked issue gets a paper clip before dice can be rolled, you have to do some preliminary tension-pumping if you want to resolve it (since it won't be full unless you add another die).</li></ul>
So, assuming I've got all that about right (feel free to correct me on whatever, especially since I think that some of the above is a misunderstanding on my part even though I think this is how the rules <i>should</i> work having never played), here are some actual questions phrased as questions!<br/><br/>Since you have to have a chance to add paper clips before rolling but after staking issues, how do you know when to roll?  It's clear that you can't roll immediately upon establishing that there's a conflict, so do you just play until it 'feels right' or what?<br/><br/>How are you handling resolution and narration?  You're setting some vague stakes for direction and then (eventually) rolling.  The highest roll (or most successes or something, I'm not clear on who wins) gets their stakes.  Do all others (assuming more than two issues) lose?  Then whoever's color wins overall gets to decide whether resolution is final and the cards and dice are out of play.  Does one person then narrate the end (the winner, the loser, the color winner?), or do you instead just play out the rest of the scene using the outcome of the roll as a guide?<br/><br/>For this playtest, was there anything that set 'PCs' apart from 'NPCs' other than just saying?  It seems that all the mechanical power is in issues and dice and that neither are tied to a specific character (or were they and I'm just missing it).  I guess I'm asking whether the story could have morphed mid-session to be about Yuki and Fea; could Shima have faded into a more supporting role?<br/><br/>How many scenes did you go through?  How many scenes had no conflicts and were just used to pump dice into issues?  How many scenes had more than one conflict?  How many scenes had more than one conflict in which a single issue was used in both conflicts?<br/><br/>How many dice did each player start with?  Was there a rhythm where players had most of their dice staked on issues and felt the need to toss some conflicts around to get them back, or was there a decent 'reserve' of dice in front of each player most of the time?  Did players tend to spend as many dice as they could on issues as soon as possible, or was there enough of a limit on dice availability that people were more selective?<br/><br/>Um... that's enough for now.  I'll give you some time to catch your breath.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            And I have mechanics answers.<br/><br/>People do own issues.  We auctioned them, one by one.  Winner gives the dice they bid to the second-place loser (in this case, easy, since there's just me and Eric).  The issue is then theirs, forevermore.  So we started the game already intensely loaded with each other's dice (more so, in fact, than with our own).<br/><br/>Right now there's no way for the system to do more than two-sided conflict.  I'm thinking about it, but it's a bit of a stumper (as Andrew Morris has occasionally had reason to discover in Unistat).<br/><br/>All the rest of your bullet points are correct.<br/><br/>When to resolve:  When nobody wants to put more dice on their cards.<br/><br/>Who narrates:  The GM ... what do you think this is, some hippy game? :-)<br/><br/>PCs:  Issue cards are not, <i>on the card</i>, tied into individual characters, but the process of dumping them into the game includes making those ties explicit.  So "You care more about someone else" became implicitly "Yuki cares more about someone else than he does about Shima."  That having been said, I anticipate that in three+ player games, one player will "go out" first ... removing all their conflicts (and probably their dice at the same time) from the game.  Their characters part in the story is pretty much finished at that point, and the player becomes (effectively) appreciative audience.<br/><br/>Scene counts:  Nine scenes, of which four were solo scenes, four were one-conflict scenes, and the ninth was the scene where we hit the final two issues in two separate conflicts.<br/><br/>Dice:  Players started with twelve dice.  We were close to going out, but didn't quite manage it.  There were three phases of rhythm:  In the early game we had way more dice than we could possible place, and so we placed with wild abandon.  When everything was placed, we went to conflicts.  In the mid-game, we had enough dice to fill up <i>some</i> of our conflicts, but not all, and things got a bit more focussed.  In the end game, so many conflicts had been resolved that we were back to filling up a given conflict and jumping into it as quickly and effectively as we could.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>

                            You can only put dice on your own issues.  So when another player does something that they think <i>should</i> cause you to put a die of their color on the issue (because they're emotionally active on it) it's your judgment call.  If you notice and validate it, you put a die.  If you don't notice, or don't buy it, you don't.<br/><br/>Likewise, you can notice things that they didn't intend, and validate them by adding a die.  Like "Oh, wow!  That totally means you're falling for her!"  "Does not!"  "I'm putting a die!"  "It doesn't mean anything, I tell you!"<br/><br/>The GM narrates conflict outcomes and plays NPCs.  That's what the rules give them.<br/><br/>If they <i>choose</i> to bid high on all the external conflicts, and therefore end up with ownership of them, that's a way that they can leverage those abilities.  I suspect it will happen a good amount of the time, but by no means always.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>So, as you're envisioning play, the only issues that are not tied to a character are the External ones?  That is, because external conflicts are about the world/setting, they can be used regardless of which characters are present.<br/><br/>Is there a reason you feel the need to tie internal and relationship issues to one and only one character?  Couldn't multiple characters embody a 'you don't respect me' relationship?  Do you tie the issues to single characters or character-pairs for simplicity's sake, since you've only got so much time to play, or do you think the game's just more fun that way?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Simplicity's sake.  My limited playtest experience leads me to think that the ability to say "Oh, hey ... my character is working off jealousy issues <b>too</b>!" does not empower people in a format this small, it just presents them with too many alternatives, and induces writer's block.<br/><br/>Likewise, last week's version of the rules had people handing the cards back and forth as control over the issues shifted.  But, really, who controls the issue isn't ... well ... the issue.  It's the emotional build-up and set-tos surrounding them.  Letting the players focus their attention on just a few of the outstanding issues (rather than everything they might potentially end up with in their hand) lets them tell a story easily.                        </div>

You give up your dice, but you end up with your opponent's.  I'm not entirely sure why you'd want more of your dice than your opponent's dice, though I can see why you might want a balance between the two.

                            You can place one of <i>your</i> dice on a card by doing something that you think of as impacting the situation.<br/><br/>You can only place one of <i>someone else's</i> dice on a card when they do something that you think of as impacting the situation.<br/><br/>So the different dice need you to be in different mental modes.  I wouldn't say that playing someone else's dice actually requires that they help you do it (you can, after all, wilfully misinterpret them ... that's half the fun!) but it certainly puts you in a position where they can make your creative work easier or harder.                        </div>

                            Not this week, probably next week.<br/><br/>So here's my question to solve for the next playtest:  Motifs, as they're currently worded, are "You do X once, then you do X again, and you benefit.  Lather, rinse, repeat."<br/><br/>But things are, in fact, reincorporated most often in threes, not in twos.  The T-Rex menaces the protagonists in Jurassic Park, <i>then</i> it appears again as part of the living nature diorama (eating some herd dinosaurs), and <i>then</i> it is not surprising when the T-Rex inexplicably shows up to save the protagonists from the attacking velociraptors.  If it were, say, a pack of deinonychuses then you'd cry out "Oh LAME!  Deus Ex Machina!"  But you've seen the T-Rext that all-important two times before, so you buy it without question.<br/><br/>Similarly, Ben discusses the light-saber as a weapon, <i>then</i> he chops someone's arm off with it in the Cantina, and therefore when you've got an old man and a virile young robot duking it out with candy-bars of solid light <i>it doesn't surprise you</i>.  In fact, it's cool and expected.  <i>Of course</i> they must meet in a climactic light-saber duel.  Of course.<br/><br/>So ... mechanics to support this more-than-two-stage reincorporation?  Having two holding-bins ("Use it once and you get into bin <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, use it again and you move from bin <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> to bin <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, use it a third time and you can spend from bin #2") is obvious but clunky.<br/><br/>Perhaps you can add one die each time you incorporate/reincorporate?  And the benefit of the Motifs is that they let you spend more than one die in a single chunk?  That would, for instance, side-step the red/blue/red/blue pattern that tied us up in the end of our playtest ... and maybe you can spend a motif's dice even if it exceeds the number of dice allowed on your card?  Like, "So long as the card is not already at or above maximum you may spend either one die directly or a motif's full payload."<br/><br/>If you do that then there's no benefit to incorporating then directly spending off reincorporation.  The benefit only comes in the third or later appearance of the same motif (where you get to spend two or more dice at once).<br/><br/>Any other thoughts on how to encourage this pattern?                        </div>

                            Again improv hat, <em>everything</em> is in threes.  We're hard-wired for threes.  The mantra is "Three, and out."  <br/><br/>I'd make a powerful mechanical incentive for sticking it out - there may be times when you want to enjoy the modest benefit of immediate reincorporation, but more often you'll want to hold out for something five times as awesome one iteration away.                        </div>

                            Would you rather that a player "re-enter" a conflict they have won (starting with a handicap for opponents) or do you want other players to call for a player to put the conflict back on the table so that they can "steal" the victory? Resolved conflicts have an inherent worth as both game currency and story twists. <br/><br/>For example: This space princess is cute. I want to rescue her. (player 1 gets control)<br/>She's paying an awful lot of attention to the pilot. I want her to think he's a jerk. (player 1 keeps control, story element gains value so it's more attractive to other players)<br/>She's my what? Ewwwww! I kissed her! (player 2 gains control over the storyline twist and now has the points, etc. to use.                        </div>

                            So far I'm physically representing them in a style lifted from <i>1001 Nights</i>:  You make a little pile of dice.  If you don't remember what the pile is for then it obviously wasn't a good motif, and you have to put them back in your main pool.<br/><br/>Russell:  I'm not talking right now about conflicts, I'm talking about motifs of the characters ... like "I hate snakes!" or "Let go your conscious self and act on instinct" or a shy smile that lights up the room.  They're character abilities, created as (and because) you make them prominent.                        </div>

                            You can make a motif for another character (the motif being under your control, but the other character not being) by spending their dice to create it.  So yeah, that works.<br/><br/>I created, for instance, "You always slip out of answering the tough questions!" as a motif on Eric's character, and I could have used it pretty much at will :-)                        </div>
