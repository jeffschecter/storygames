I'm sort of <a href="http://ommatidia.org/" rel="nofollow">into constraints</a>, so those rules are incredibly powerful to me.<br/><br/>I realize that not everybody who MCs is going to go mute except when they have a line of dialogue that conforms to a move, and I'm certainly not a perfect adherent myself yet.

The things I'm getting are:<br/>\n<br/>\n* The MC Moves list is an explicit list of things the MC should be doing to bring a good game.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Fronts are a (possibly) new way of describing adversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nExplicit lists are good, as they prompt people to try the things on the list that they wouldn't otherwise think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to look at Fronts a bit more: I've not read that in detail yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for the in-the-moment practice of GMing, what the GM actually does when everyone's sat at the table, playing the game, I don't see that much different in AW from many other games I GM. So, disregarding pre-session prep (Fronts, bangs, etc), what's different about AW when compared to games like Dogs, Sorcerer, or SotC?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there's something in there about AW being all task resolution, as opposed to conflict resolution in games like DitV and Sorcerer. An AW MC is always asking 'what do you do?' not 'why are you doing it?'<br/>\n<br/>\n(I completely accept that the MC advice in AW might align with my natural GMing mode. I'm asking because, if there is a difference between, say MCing AW and GMing Sorcerer, I can't really see it. That means I'm missing something about how I GM.

Did I do that before AW? Totally.

This is not just advice, these are your rules for interacting in the game and why" I love games with clear GM priorities like that. Sorcerer tells the GM to make humanity centric situations and to author relevant open ended bangs to the players Kickers, Burning Wheel tells the GM to challenge the fuck out of the player beliefs, and AW tells the MC to make the world real, be fans of the characters, and play to find out what happens to them.

I've played Dogs, Sorcerer and SotC. SotC is actually decent about saying "this, here, is what you can do with dice, and this, here, is when you have to / are allowed to roll them", but the other two aren't so explicit about that (esp. Sorcerer), and none as good as AW. The dice mechanic in AW is actually nothing to write home about - it feels a lot like Unisystem to me - but the fact that the moves tell you what happens next means you won't have to come up with that on the fly. Compare it with a fictional Sorcerer supplement with pages upon pages of generic Bangs, if you will, with the outcome of one Bang funneling into the next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290878/#Comment_290878" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T11:05:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2010 11:05AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2010 11:06AM by Johnstone.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Neil, here's my thoughts on why Fronts are so nice:<br><br>Apocalypse World is one of those games where characters are the main focus, and players haven't out-and-out accepted that they showed up to follow the GM's plotline and that they should explore every single hint the GM drops. In older games of this style, the GM has the awful job of throwing stuff at the players until something sticks and they get interested. In my old games, I've found this leads to a resentful GM, after the players ignore all of his cool ideas.<br><br>In AW, the fronts are formulated so that if the players ignore a hook the MC throws out, he can just take it back, advance it (ie make it more of a problem) and re-introduce it later. If the players continue to ignore the front, it grows and grows until it becomes a problem they simply can't ignore. That's part of what fronts are for.<br><br>So in the old days:<br>GM: "So there's this wolf, looks like it's infected by some kinda fungal mange."<br>Players: "Yeah, whatever, we got things to do."<br/>GM: grumble, grumble "Always ignore the good stuff..." grumble<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World:<br/>MC: "So now you can see people with that fungal mange infection."<br/>Players: "Huh? What infection?"<br/>MC: "Y'know, like you saw on that wolf you avoided."<br/>Players: "Oh, right. People are infected now? Uh-oh. We give them a wide berth. I don't want to catch it."<br/>MC: "Okay."<br/><br/>Later:<br/>MC: "The fungal mange zombies attack your convoy."<br/>Players: "Aaaagh! Drive! Drive!"<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290879/#Comment_290879" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T11:07:57+00:00" title="September  1, 2010 11:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that this isn't new of course.

For your game of AW, does it mean, like Brian said, to hold on lightly? To play your NPCs with passion, but ultimately let them meet their fates and not wrestle the game around to protect them? Yeah, it means that. But the dial can be turned way, way up, if you want to. Like, <i>MC, do everything you can to tear the NPCs down, ruin their lives, burn their hopes and dreams, bury them in the poisoned ground.</i> When you turn it all the way up you show the brutal realities of the apocalypse world (but without "punishing" the PCs to get the point across).<br/><br/>Like every principle and move in AW, <i>look through crosshairs</i> requires a judgment call from the MC (and sometimes the players, too) continuously, case-by-case. Even though the game has very specific instructions and advocates a specific style of play, the implementation of those instructions is very diverse (since different people = different judgment calls).<br/><br/>Further example: <b>when you do something under fire.</b> When do you call for that move? What counts as "under fire"? That's a very interesting space to make judgment calls. It varies from person to person, group to group -- even in different campaigns with the same group of players. In one of our games, the warlord's withering gaze would count as acting under fire. In a different AW series with the same people, not so much.<br/><br/>And then, when you hit the roll with a 7-9, what's a worse outcome? A hard bargain? An ugly choice? It's all context-specific, dependent utterly on the MC's vision, judgment, and personal style.<br/><br/>There's huge room for diversity in that apparently specific game text. I would even argue that the game <i>demands</i> diversity, given its reliance on group- and context-specific judgments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290924/#Comment_290924" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T13:38:57+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  1:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the crosshairs thing, it makes me free to make awesome NPC's without feeling like I'm imposing the GM's darling on the players for the life of the game.

This led to a lot of non-fun that I now regret (though it didn't stop us from playing 20-60 hours each week until we were in college).<br/><br/>I'm not sure the game asked this of me exactly, but I wasn't introduced by anyone to the hobby; I picked up the first The Dark Eye box on my own, read only that game (for a couple of years), and played accordingly.  So this came 100% out of how I interpreted the game text.  But I'm not sure this was how the authors actually intended it, because it could have been a lot more fun if I'd been a fan of the PCs, if I'd supported the kind of fun my players wanted instead of trying to keep them within a box of "doing it right", etc.<br/><br/>Having a firm set of principles like in AW would have helped me immensely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290994/#Comment_290994" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T20:06:02+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  8:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's what I don't get: The idea that "being a GM" is a monolithic skill set that applies to all RPGs everywhere all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291027/#Comment_291027" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T02:30:25+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  2:30AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with a couple of people in this thread - MCing is a BIG change for some people.<br/><br/>For many many years the games i played and ran were basically - a "plot" has been made, and the players will go along it in some way. Often there were cool side tracks and weirdness, but there was STORY to be found and followed.<br/><br/>One GM I play with is notoriously bad (or good) at this. He will start a game saying - "this will be about X, make some characters", and then flesh out the plot based on the characters. The games are a lot of fun and all, but I've often gotten a feeling of being swept along and not being able to make really big changes. Its almost a joke at times that "plot demands" something happens and referring to Plot as another character, or the BBEG itself.<br/><br/>Playing Apocalypse world is completely opposite to this method. There is no plot, just a situation that the players' characters interact with.<br/><br/>I have tried running more "sandbox" games, but with the group I play with normally this basically demands that there be a bunch of "plots" that can be picked up or interwoven. Unless i made those plots then the game would often start to get unfocussed.<br/><br/>MCing is a set of rules - explicit rules of do this, dont do that, keep track of X etc. When i ran a series of session with Apocalypse World it really was instructions for running a sandbox game where the players' characters are the main protagonists. There is no plot at all - in fact one of the great joys I had was in discovering just what in heck was really going on <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> That was something I'd never experienced as a GM before!<br/><br/>The game is also a pretty much "sit down and run". I literally just printed out the playbooks, an MC cheat sheet with the principles and moves, and the 1st session sheet. We all sat down, and within 5 mins we were roleplaying these whacked out people in dangerous frontiers. I spent 10 minutes after that session organising my scribbles into the fronts, and never again did any game prep. We would sit down each session, have a brief recap, and launch into playing again.<br/><br/>Compared to my previous pre-game setup of statting out NPCs, preparing plot points and scenes, and laying out clues for the players to pick up - I was spending more time preparing than actually playing, and was loosing my enjoyment of RP in general.<br/><br/>To me, the MC rules were a way of clearly doing what I always wanted to do with RP but never quite knew how. Run a sandbox game without much preparation and get straight to the "good bits" of RP.<br/><br/>-K                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291030/#Comment_291030" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T03:35:55+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  3:35AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I began using the 'no story beforehand' approach after reading Dust Devils and Sorcerer back in 2004. Before that I was firmly (very, very firmly) rooted in the pre-plotted game structure, and indeed did spend a lot of time and energy struggling with why it sucked so much, and why it never really worked. I wrote convention scenarios for 10+ years exploring that - better late than never, I guess. See what happens in play is all I do these days.<br/><br/>I agree with John that the myth about AW changing GM-ing is quite annoying and stupid. If you were running games differently that AW proscribes, sure, it's bound to change your ways. But if you ran Dogs in the past, and Sorcerer or Trollbabe before that, much of it will be familiar, albeit dressed in new, evocative, words, which I like, I might add.<br/><br/>I one way it's good if AW brings GM tasks/responsibilities, but there's a slght danger that we might relapse into seeing the GM as a person and not as a set of roles/responsibilities that differ from game to game. Sometimes all of them are with one person, sometimes they are shared among the participants.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291031/#Comment_291031" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T03:53:39+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  3:53AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that reading Apocalypse World is going to change the way I play Happy Birthday Robot.

Yes, people may well be doing this stuff for some of their games, but not this exact combination, and not so explicitly. When a game comes out and people say "well, I was doing that all along" you know you are onto something solid. The GM instructions mesh perfectly with the system - there isn't that weird misty space you get between system and actual play you get in some games. This applies equally to the higher level advice (fronts and threats), and the mental state you need to MC (NPCs in the crosshairs, etc).<br/><br/>The examples show me that Vincent is a much more vicious and unpleasant GM than I'd ever get away with; making horrible things happen with no chance of intervention. I now have permission to throw a grenade at a sleeping PC, then say "I'm your biggest fan."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291330/#Comment_291330" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T06:49:22+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  6:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><br/>In Dogs, you do the things it says to do in the GM section: Actively reveal the town in play, Drive play towards conflicts, Push for small stakes, etc. In Apocalypse World you make Apocalypse World seem real, play to find out what happens, and make the characters' lives not boring.

That method is right for those games. The method used in AW and DitV is, clearly, intended for Story Now play. I think what people are talking about is that AW <i>very clearly spells out</i> how to do Story Now play, not that AW will change how they play (f.ex.) WFRPG3; nor how AW's principles (let's take "look at NPCs through crosshairs") will necessarily be right for all other games, narrativist or otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291738/#Comment_291738" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T03:11:50+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  3:11AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, I think I've got it.
