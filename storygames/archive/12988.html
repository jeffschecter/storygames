I've done a few audio Actual Play Recordings (Here's my recordings of <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/PrometheusChainedUsurpationManeuver1" rel="nofollow">Burning Empires</a>, <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/YouCanHackitAP1" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a>, <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/TuesdayNightTerrorsPennyForMyThoughtsPlaytest" rel="nofollow">Penny for my Thoughts</a>) and I found that the best way to capture audio is to hang the microphone above the table.  Like, onto a light fixture or something. For the Microphone I use, it works really well to have the device recording "above" our voices.  It also serves to have us ignore the mic and focus on playing.  It also keeps it off the table, as dice clatter and table bumps are no one's friend.  I suppose this is why they have boom mics.  <br/><br/>My microphone is usually plugged into either a computer (usually a laptop) running <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Audacity</a> (a great little free audio editing program), or onto a little digital recorder I bring to games.  Either work fine.  <br/><br/>The microphone itself varies.  I've used this <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=11037550" rel="nofollow">one</a> and it's great, plus cheap at 10 bucks. Anything Omnidirectional works fine, as long as it's above the play area.  Positioning it above the play area is key, in my experience, of getting the best possible sound. Tossing it onto the table makes for all kinds of awful.<br/><br/>In addition, turn off any other noise in the background.  A TV or worse, an Air conditioner is death to most Audio recordings.  I've found that fans, so long as they are not blowing on the microphone, are ok, but the rumbling of an AC just kills the sound quality.  That would mean no mood music in the background either.  <br/><br/>However, keep in mind that game sessions are not narratives in the radio drama sense. They start and stop, people say what their character does, then change their minds, then change them again.  The GM adds details to a scene that weren't there a moment ago, and the whole thing is like a fractured puzzle that each player has pieces of, putting it all together to get a sense of what's happening in the moment.  Game sessions, like conversations in general, are messy things, full of in jokes and group references, off tangent and out of order. <br/><br/>To extract something that resembles a radio drama from a game session would take such a staggering amount of cutting and trimming that it makes me shudder to think about it. I did a montage of useful events from previous games at the beginning of each Burning Empires Actual play I did, and that was so very, very, very much work.<br/><br/>The whole thing you said about analyzing voice patterns, that's really not going to be that useful.  The only way to get a montage is to find it, and that means listening to hours upon hours of your game, and cutting out the bits you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292849/#Comment_292849" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T11:19:07+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 11:19AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2010 11:21AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something else you might consider -- if it proves to be really difficult to put together a montage that illustrates an important moment in the game from cutting together the actual game recording, you could always come back from a mid-game break and ask the players to recap what just happened.

I'd listen to the previous game the day before the next session and it worked well to refresh my memory.  Now I wish I had made better notes of what happens where in the recording or did some light editing of the longer tangents when I did this.  At the time it would have been little effort, but now it's daunting.<br/><br/>The recording quality I got was good for my purposes, but probably not publishable.<br/><br/>If people aren't resting their arms on the table, like if you're playing around something more like a coffee table, you can just put it on the table.  I sort of like the dice rolling sound you get from this.  Otherwise, I'd put it on an unused chair or arm of a couch and kind of point it at the center of the room.  As mentioned, air conditioning running really hurts quality.  Also, larger rooms with lots of hard flat surfaces are your enemy, there's a lot of echo.  Also, some kind of recording light in your line of sight is good.  I've lost a few bits as the recorder turned off for various reasons (probably mostly batteries), but computers will often stop if they get busy doing something else.  Best to keep them off the internets.  Also, if you record with a laptop, you definitely will want an external microphone.  The fan will turn on sometimes and really hurt the sound quality.<br/><br/>I haven't really done anything with stereo recording, that may be different.  A lot of the echo effects the recorder picks up are pretty similar to what you hear if you just cover one ear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
