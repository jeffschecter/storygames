I feel how the systems might interact, I get the sense that something will emerge, something new and wonderful. This time, it's going to be just right. Just perfect, and new, and interesting, and the way roleplaying <i>should</i> be.<br/><br/>Sometimes I buy the game. Sometimes I read it. Sometimes I play it. Occasionally, something like that dream emerges; not necessarily because of the game. <br/><br/>Sometimes, back in the day, I'd spend years chasing that dream. Last time I did it was a six-session campaign of Burning Empires a year or two ago, because I did believe that it would be magic if we managed to play it just right. <br/><br/>I think this dream is one of the things that keeps the hobby/art going. We want to believe, and we do believe, and we're not really all that disappointed when this game doesn't deliver, because there's always the next game, which will be better. Maybe even perfect, for real, this time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352693/#Comment_352693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T08:17:57+00:00" title="December 29, 2011  8:17AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, you could try to enjoy each game for what it actually is, and each session for a good time with interesting people doing interesting things.

And some games do them but it's always exciting when new games improve on these techniques and goals.<br/><br/>I don't believe in the single perfect game though.
