The setting is full of neat ideas and locations, the different character types are interesting and interact in unpredictable ways, and I like the way the whole game is predicated on the characters seizing power and turning everything upside down.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I seem to be incapable of creating a character, let alone running a game.  And the long-awaited 2nd Edition seems to have cleaned up the setting stuff quite a bit, but, from what I read online, hasn't fixed the mechanics much.  <br/><br/>I've tried Wuxalted (Wushu + Exalted) and found it lacking.  I've heard of people using PDQ and Heroquest for it, as well.  I'd love to hear what people have tried and how it worked.<br/><br/>EDIT: It occurs to me that I should mention what I want to keep -- the high powered characters and the strong flavor of the setting.  I'm  trying to leave the crunchiness and the burden of multiple charms and optimal builds behind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125061/#Comment_125061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T20:30:01+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  8:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not tried it, but there's also <a href="http://spin.wishray.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=25&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Exalted in the Vineyard</a>, which looks promising.

We then migrated to Weapons of the Gods and I have to say, that worked pretty darn well. The main problems are that the caste roles are a bit tougher to fill out (as written the setting is basically all dawn, all the time), new Lore sheets are a bit onerous to create, and every weapon needs it strike rating dropped by 5, but those are still less work than statting up a few NPCs in Exalted. In terms of tone, i was sold on it in the first fight, but we eventually switched to 2e when it came out because some of our character concepts were not well supported (most notably the craftsman).<br/><br/>BESM/SAS works very well for _play_, but breaks down on chargen and advancement.  It's too open ended for the theme.<br/><br/>Risus works very well with only minimal hackery.  Allow "charms" to do dice adding, then make die size reflect type of exalt (d4=mortal, d6=db, d8=lunar or sidereal, d10=solar or Abyssal).<br/><br/>If think I'd probably suggest the original <a href="http://www.white-wolf.com/exaltedweb/Downloads/ExaltedQuickstart.pdf" rel="nofollow">Exalted Quickstart</a>, which is  fantastic. It has all the setting you need to get excited about the game, and a very nice, lightweight and abstract system for play that cuts right to the heart of what the Solars are all about. <br/><br/>And all that said, I can't wait til Jonathan W has all his stuff in one place. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125153/#Comment_125153" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T09:54:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  9:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me second Rob's nomination of the original Quickstart, which is excellent.

We've played three hours, broken into three sessions (lunchtime work play with coworkers). They're all new to Exalted, but it works since they have the freedom to help define the world (I'm ignoring most canon until it comes up in play).<br/><br/>I need to tweak the character generation - people seem to have too many useless skills, and it took way too long for my tastes. But I think to do that, I might need to make more serious changes to HQ, and first, I want to play it more to make sure it's not just me and my players learning the rules, and second, I'm hoping that by the time I have that information HeroQuest generic will be out, or Other Worlds will be out which I can consider as an alternative, and have to do less tweaking and guessing on my part.<br/><br/>I also want to find a way to play up "stunts". But mechanically it's oh, so good and captures the range of power really well.  In the first hour, they snuck past a naval blockade, parlayed with the captain, and talked his queen into an alliance that really benefits their empire building goals. Since then, they've fought hordes of pirates, summoned Elementals, and worked with gods. HQ's relationships and personality traits have really help driven the flavor of their choices. And the simple contests help give it a feel of broad, powerful action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125283/#Comment_125283" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T15:04:01+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  3:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin, do you have any AP or conversion notes lying around the web?

The story began with a blockade. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5388&amp;page=1#Item_37" rel="nofollow">Which I gave first lines for in this thread.</a>.  Oh, I also posted a basic structure of my conversion on <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=8295365&amp;postcount=11" rel="nofollow">RPGnet</a>. I will be posting the full conversion, but after I've run it through some hoops. I'm not entirely satisfied with how the character creation structure is, so there's still some tweaks I'm brainstorming.<br/><br/>And my story so far is actually not too helpful, so I'll give you a follow up of what happened after those first words. So, with the Dawn Sailor out on his Artifact ship, the Eclipse Scholar and Twilight Architect decided to try and parlay.<br/><br/>The Twilight summoned up a Water Elemental as back up. I did the spell as an auto success, but made him roll to control it. So, he picked a quality of Elemental (12m) and added up his various abilities (ways of magic, Speak Old Realm, and Magic Excellency) 14m, and got a Complete Victory - for the Complete Victory, I bumped the quality of the elemental to 14m.<br/><br/>They went out, and discovered that an ocean god, Jagged Bloody Rocks, was also guarding the fleet, but because of the Eclipse, they were safe as long as they didn't initiate hostilities. They met with the captain, who was no match for their social abilities, and in a roll convinced him to consider an alliance. He sent a messenger to their Queen and said that she'd have to decide that. They returned to their island and the Dawn returned, using his sailing abilities and ship's magic to sneak through the blockade (this was another simple contest).  There was a humorous moment as he got his ship ready for combat in the dock, before the other two characters filled him in on the information that they were planning on a peaceful solution.<br/><br/>There was some confusion on what to do next, and I made clear that the next step was their's. The captain was expecting a proposal for an alliance to send to the Queen. They should choose not to do that, and do something else (like fight) if they wanted. They wanted to try for an alliance. Once that was figured out, I told them the resistence, they added together their abilities that would make an alliance useful, resources they were willing to provide (she wants help in defense against the Realm, or her neighboring allies loyal to the Realm), as well as using their Charms and abilities for persuasion and showing off their power. They got a major victory, so not only did they get an alliance, but the Queen is at a penalty if she wants to work against the terms of the alliance.<br/><br/>And that was the first session.  The next session happened over the course of a month of game time, so they did simple contests of sweeping actions (recruiting workers, researching in the library, consulting with high placed members of the kingdom and planning for defense construction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125838/#Comment_125838" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T14:06:43+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  2:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the links and the AP!

I need to post on the site, but here's the mod and p.1 of the character sheet:  <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/wheel-of-fate" rel="nofollow">Exalted Wheel of Fate</a>.<br/><br/>Edited to add that the Charms as defined are pretty light, but they still overshadow Aspects--at first.  What we're finding is that Aspects have a lot of potential to even the odds once Charms have been cast, plus the dramatic invocation possibilities put a lot of narrative power in the hands of the players.  I have some lingering concerns whether the high-powered nature of the game will break the engine, but so far the players seem to really like it.  I'll have to post a sample character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125865/#Comment_125865" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T15:46:59+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  3:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't seen the character sheet before.

We played last weekend and it worked brilliantly.  As I am a constant rules modder I had to play around with them.  I took out doubling of favoured and aspect abilities and instead added in SotC aspects to cover sorcery, charms, emotional attributes, beliefs and artifacts and tied essence directly into the use of them.  Essence recovery was only available by compelling the aspects. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall an excellent experience which was manageable even with 6 players.  If we had played the original scion/exalted mash we may have still been there now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
