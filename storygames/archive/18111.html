If you feel your heart and stomach is big enough to take whining, read on. Otherwise, please do something healthy instead.<br/><br/>We're playing based on Next playtest text. Previously we had thirty-something 4E Essentials sessions (about 4 hours each). The DM is the same guy who is our host as well.<br/><br/>Essentials went mildly boring and mildly frustrating for me. The weightless, meaningless wanderings between encounters (read: fighty fights) were basically the most interesting things as these were the occassions where the DM could show us his lovingly created world. The encounters were the obligatory roadblocks enabling and empowering me to these further questions about the worlds mysteries. I almost never used an encounter for what my instincts told me to do: for generating interesting situation (failing to heal a fallen PC, fleeing the whole scene--in short, not doing the expected encounter behavior). It was slow as hell both in terms of character advancement and in discovering the DM's fantasies, but still something to latch onto. And occassionally there was some spark of creativity, often as part of the meaningless (in terms of the fight-scene series part of the game) wanderings and more rarely as a futile attempt to make moves in fights that made effin sense in the fiction. When I saw the lost focus in the Next playtest texts, I had some hopes about more room for these creative moments. Maybe the DM will have an easier time noticing these meaningful moments and responding to our cherished ideas.<br/><br/>We're now playing with the same DM &amp; Tegel Manor Gamescience edition &amp; D&amp;D Next playtest. There is also a new player who is fairly new to the hobby as well but he seems engaged--unreasonably so. He is doing a lot like what I described above as the meaningless wandering between encounters. The catch is that in this game is not so futile at all. But he is doing this with such high hopes that it seems futile again. (E. g. here if we have some zero-level helpers, they can actually help digging the trap for the enemy. They are not _just_ one-hit meat shields.) In our former game encounters were designed by the DM only, and we the players only had moment-to-moment tactics so this is good news in terms of not being negated by the system when you start strategizing, thus saying things out of encounter.<br/>But man, this person wants it big time. He and the GM play out (speak "in character") the hardest negotiations in history (like asking NPCs for further support after some of their friends have already died on our side... for free). I am not sure but it seems that he wants to get those helping hands sooo bad, he could spend the whole session negotiating with the same NPC about some unreasonably unfair request from our side. And that's totally understandable from a "play your characters as real people" standpoint, but holy hell, this is D&amp;D. Real people stay in their homes and hope for the best. PCs are the ones who are not always successful at dying but try really really hard.<br/>The other two players--including me--don't see the point in trying most of these things (buying armor is okay, it's a quick administering of your character sheet to increase survival chances, but begging for a free potion of healing seems like 0-10% chance of success and decreasing (furthermore failure means barely anything--hey, this is no Apocalypse World) so it's not okay: we want to do some adventuring instead. ("Adventuring" is very hard to grab, though: my best guess is that we have a taste for higher probabilities of the GM saying new things to respond to.) The possibility of some PC dying seems not so bad if on the other hand more stuff can leave the GMs mouth than the villagers saying "No deal" one more time.<br/>Not to say that dying PCs are not an issue for me. The beloved Random Stupid Death of old-school is still evading me. I just cannot see any other point to it than standing as an evidence that each and every player decision with the goal of increasing the chances of survival is mistaken. But wait: RSD can be evaded by an infinite amount of player input about securing every detail of the plan and action of the PCs. Moving from inch-to-inch, check for traps, look for monsters, poke with the 10' pole, take one step... Like a mantra. Perfect procedure can make your characters tough as hell. They don't fight they way out, they pick fights. They don't pick anything randomly, they choose one of the researched routes. . Designing then reciting the perfect procedure is a total analytic left-brain, mostly routine puzzle-solving excercise I have done a lot in my RPG career (and in Diablo II) but I realized at a point that this is just not what humans are for. (I know more than one people who could write a program which plays D&amp;D3.5 the same way as the former me.) Happily my perfect routine theory is just not true. Random Stupid Death is random. The DM yawns "here, see, these people ambush you..." and your character is dead. No matter how long you worked on your goggles of ambush detection if the DM says they don't work for some reason. So really, using fictional and mechanical positioning with the objective of saving your PCs is just futile. Why don't just go and see what happens--how the PCs die, mostly--without any puzzle solving, hoop jumping and mind reading the DM?<br/>If I bring a lot of filled 1st level character sheets with me to supply the death machine (one character at a time) or I bring a whole warband at the same time and see how the battle of attrition goes, how can this work together with the more cautious approach of other players? Will my behaviour teach this other approach effectively or will they be frustrated about me "not taking the game seriously"?<br/><br/>I know that a lot of the story gamer people had much fun with Moldvay. Can reading (or playing, even) Moldvay D&amp;D make me understand what is one satisfying way of playing under the D&amp;D umbrella or do I seem completely misaligned for this?<br/><br/>Of course I want to make this game worthwile and saving my ass socially this way.<br/><br/>Please respond if you have something to say about any part of this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408898/#Comment_408898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T07:31:59+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  7:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a whole lot to unpack here - Moldvay is a pretty lethal edition of D&amp;D, so if you're avoiding Random Deaths, it may not be such a great idea - but I'm puzzled because there's a lot at work here and very little of it seems to be at D&amp;D's feet.<br/><br/>I haven't read the playtest docs for Next, but my recollection is that Essentials, like the edition that powers it, is among the least deadly editions of D&amp;D.

My day is better already.<br/><br/><br/>Adam:<br/><br/>What is "meaningless"? This is an easy one. In 4E (Essentials or not) it's very hard to influence battles from without and vice versa: your particular way and level of success of dealing with the enemy will not change the non-encounter world a bit, even encounters don't have too much to do with each other. Well, daily powers and Healing Surges and Action Points, but in our campaign not even these--we had the houserule of only 1 HS regained/day but because the lot of ficitonal time between battles, we nearly always had the dailies and the action point and mostly the HSs as well.<br/>So I was using meaningless in this very specific meaning, but of course I can tell you my abstract definiton as well. Please ask for it as I am not convinced it's interesting in this particular sitch.<br/>Probably, this "meaningless" (from the encounters point of view) thing was interesting because while encounters provided roadblocks to tackle, the unstructured space between them was somewhat continuous (meaningful) as our (or rather the DM's) not totally bad notions and instincts about conversation made it so.<br/><br/>A thing about the world's mysteries: I think it's clear to you but if not, I want to clarify: I have a deep fear about character death not only ending the story of that person but also my effectiveness at engaging with the world (whiff factor, traditional time-consuming model of introducing the new character, etc.).<br/><br/>What to do if even the GM is not satisfied with the game two of them are playing? What to do if none of them are? Am I extrapolating?<br/><br/><br/>Jason:<br/><br/>Yes, I clearly do not get the Random Silly Deaths yet. But don't you think it makes more sense if it's put into the right context? I started reading Moldvay to find that context. I might be looking for the Holy Grail, though.<br/>Essentially in Essentials our one and only PC death was very random (totally not doing anything with player choice): the GM misinterpreted two rules in one encounter--neither of them in a lucky way for us. But this is just fun fact.<br/><br/>My notion of RSDs en masse is the product of our current game, where though only one PC and one PC-like (in stats) NPC died, we had to face the facts that character improvement, character story has a random ending point. I think at first level D&amp;D, this is not uncommon: 4E is kind of an exception, but I never really played older editions (EDIT: 3.5 really) in an old-school deadly mode.<br/><br/>No real "Do you want to talk about it?" happened so far. Don't you think the DM will be scared to death when hearing our wish-list? Yes, I do think, we will have a hard time not taking the other people's ideas as demands. But I'll try this.

I quite like 4e, and I'm going to object to some of your criticisms, but actually I'm agreeing with them to some extent. I'm hoping that, if I explain what qualifications I'd want to put on what you're saying, I might zero in on what you're looking for.\n<blockquote>What is "meaningless"? This is an easy one.

It's true to the extent that the system doesn't have stakes-setting for encounters built in, so the onus is on the DM to make sure there are clear stakes to combat when you're going in, or at least interesting fall-out when you wrap it up. As a DM, I found that sometimes I got this right, and sometimes I didn't, but it was definitely something I had to consciously adopt as a method.<br/><br/>It is, arguably, a heavy burden for the DM to bear (at least, I found it heavy), especially since the game is so consistently designed around the idea of encounters as climactic set piece battles. If the encounter isn't a set piece with interesting terrain and a cool environment, it threatens to be a grind. In practice, when I was DMing, I felt like it was impossible to just wing a combat encounter, and if each encounter was going to meaningfully affect the events that followed, it was unwise to prepare more than one encounter in advance of the session. That put a severe cap on how long we could actually play for until I ran out of material for the week---maybe 2-3 hours, tops, with one combat encounter plus some role-playing, skill challenges and what not.<br/><br/>The "climactic set piece" idea is also, arguably, out of keeping with the style of other editions. Maybe this is part of the problem, and\xa0I think this is part of what's behind <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley%27s">@JDCorley's</a> answers. It might help if you could identify what your expectations are for a dungeon crawl, and how you came by them.

For any D&amp;D edition you'll find this translated into a core book where I'd say 75% of the material is oriented to some form of combat. But then again, that's not enough to make an "epic" experience, and the rules tell little about it. That's something for the setting books and/or the GM to establish: a world and a situation where combat matters, and getting better at it is a big part for the story (otherwise there wouldn't be much of a need of leveling up rules)<br/><br/>I'd say that if you're feeling encounters just as roadblocks, then it's your GM's fault. Besides of being roadblocks, these can be chances to prove your character (as our DM used them in last session) actual turning points of the story (which will change future events in the story) or part of optional sidequests taken to further improve the situation for the characters. For example, as a DM I tend to put the players in situations that may be dangerous, but may gain them powerful allies for a future definitive battle, or allow them access to a Mc Guffin that can be used in many ways to change the story.<br/><br/>And hearing the players isn't such a bad idea: The most dramatic turn I've taken as a DM totally changed my last campaign and greatly improved the epicness. Players were in the middle of a dungeon facing all kinds of traps and encounters... and while watching a mural painting of the legend of an old villain NPC, the suddenly had an epiphany. They decided to start their own cult and make a stand against all the major kingdoms of the world instead of running around to find why they were being pursued by them. Things started to go macro as they gained more and more powerful followers and it all ended in a bigger showdown than I initially planned.<br/><br/>But again, I'd say: try both. Check the book and ask everybody what's the fun about it, and try to play it like that. And talk to your GM and that guy, hopefully you'll both commit to what would be a totally different experience of what you're used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408929/#Comment_408929" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T12:59:36+00:00" title="March 13, 2013 12:59PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            czipeter - <br/><br/>I think creases is stating that 4th Ed D&amp;D has very different design goals than previous iterations of D&amp;D and thus would give a different feel and play than previous iterations. <br/><br/>4th Ed D&amp;D has very strong encounter-specific design. Dungeon magazine (post-paizo) 4th Ed scenarios were less whole modules and more encounter set pieces. For some, it would make 4th Ed appear more disjointed and all-about-the-encounters. In reality, it requires the DM to be more proactive in making the narrative flow in between the set pieces.<br/><br/>But there was so much emphasis on those set pieces, that I myself found difficulty being flexible. Sure I could whip up a random map and some random monsters, but if mechanical positioning and map tactics weren't super interesting and dynamic, then encounter would subsequently feel flat and grindy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408932/#Comment_408932" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T13:32:26+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  1:32PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 1:32PM by noclue.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played with this GM using any system other than D&amp;D before.

It also meant players interacted differently with the adventures I put in front of them. The direction I'm vaguely gesturing toward is that 4e does have a fun place, but the DM really has to know where that is. The same is true for every edition, and each edition's "funplace" is different, though I know from experience 4e's is a little further afield if you're most at home with an earlier edition. The upshot is, players and the DM need to be clear on their expectations in terms of what a D&amp;D game "should" look like, and talk about them openly, and that's what I'm encouraging you to do. It's all about having a clear grasp on what you find fun, and what the DM and the other players are willing to do to make sure everyone at the table has a satisfying experience. I hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408962/#Comment_408962" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T17:13:28+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  5:13PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might be worth checking out this (currently ongoing) account of <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?676099-B-X-Misadventures-in-randomly-generated-dungeons" rel="nofollow">B/X D&amp;D adventures</a>.

It's a finely tuned thing, and it's best at delivering exciting combat encounters. I've played it a lot and I like it a great deal. <br/><br/>However, it might not be the right game for you. Where 4E has pages and pages of rules dedicated to optimizing character builds and constructing and playing exciting combat encounters, much less of the rules deal with other things, like:<br/><br/>* engaging with the world and its mysteries<br/>* social encounters and relationships<br/><br/>All it really offers there is a coarse-grained skill check system, a clunky and mostly unusable as-is skill challenge system, some good advice in the DMG, and DM fiat.<br/><br/>The fact that you're interested in mainly two things--exploring the "mysteries" of the DM's "lovingly created world" and what I'll call Keeping It Real (for example, "make moves in fights that made effin sense in the fiction")--suggests that you're looking for a different kind of play than 4E is tuned for.<br/><br/><br/>Am I right in guessing that:<br/><br/>* You're looking for a game where the DM and other players are aligned with you in bringing a fantasy world to life, creating characters that make sense for that world, taking actions that do no violence to your intuition about what fantasy heroes ought to be, and basking in the glory of the details of all of those things? <br/><br/>* That sure, there's plenty of room for exciting combat encounters, but only because they make sense for the fiction and not as the end-all-be-it-all of play? <br/><br/>* That you're not all that interested in testing your mettle against the DM, with rules mastery and tight character builds and all that stuff?<br/><br/>* That you're not looking to make a point about life or anything through play; you want to lose yourself in a fantasy or dream?<br/><br/><br/>Am I close?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409009/#Comment_409009" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T08:24:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  8:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for participating in this thread!

Short rests do happen and long rests as well. (But, hey, they happen on the character sheet.) They are absolutely not "meaningless". Those are the things that reset resources. The "meaningless" stuff is when we are after rests and before an encounter. Going here and there, doing this and that. We have our encounter (and rests) life and we have our out-of-encounter life which only colours our encounters. When we are in the woods, the encounters feature woodland creatures which means nothing for us, as they can have any and all special features unknown to players and we players can have only our static characters with the same powers, hp, attacks, etc. as before.

(You have to describe what fictional thing happens to the enemy that makes you sticky or marking or whatever.) Now that thing seems even worse than the boardgame which I think 4E actually is. But no, abstract win-lose maths-fighting is not my cup of tea, either. So I think it's basically a yes, I am looking for new things to see and new ways to understand things, which manifests like fictional people responding to fictional circumstances in my hobby of roleplaying. I don't want to say "I cast magic missile on him" to reduce it's hp-s to zero, not even to kill it, but to see what happens (what will the other people around the table say) if I do so.\n<blockquote><br/>* That sure, there's plenty of room for exciting combat encounters, but only because they make sense for the fiction and not as the end-all-be-it-all of play? <br/></blockquote>Agreed. Combat is just one setting for the above mentioned conversation about things and actions. It's not special.\n<blockquote><br/>* That you're not all that interested in testing your mettle against the DM, with rules mastery and tight character builds and all that stuff?<br/></blockquote>I can't add to this, it's so point on. (When I GM 4E at cons, I feel okay if I can put up some resistance, some difficulty for the players to overcome (and I feel remorse when I am unsuccessful at this) but I am not excited like when playing some other RPGs successfully.)\n<blockquote><br/>* That you're not looking to make a point about life or anything through play; you want to lose yourself in a fantasy or dream?<br/></blockquote>Yes, but not a strong one: asking and asking further seems more like it but hey, if you ask hard, a point may come across, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409021/#Comment_409021" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T13:10:47+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  1:10PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I make players describe what their characters do for every attack, even if they fail. I encourage them to fail in ways that are interesting for them, not "I swing; I miss like a fool." 4E has some odd effects (the cleric hits the orc so hard that his friends get more hit points?) that players have to struggle to explain. "As I pin the orc with my mace, I'm shouting a verse from the Book of Sacred Battles, and my friends may find strength in those words (take +1d4 temporary hit points -- if you're a believer)."<br/><br/>I've played in Wednesday night "D&amp;D Encounters" games at my FLGS where there was the barest of fictional positioning at all. Some characters were there. There was a vague reason we were all there together. We fought a thing. No one described a single attack or action other than to-hit and damage numbers. I had to switch gears mentally to find the fun.<br/><br/>So, all my pointed (leading?) questions are about that thing that evil people like me call "creative agenda." It's a term of art (read: jargon) that basically describes the synergy that happens when everyone at the table cares about the same thing and pushes for it at the same time. If you don't have that synergy, you can get different people pushing in different directions at different times, resulting in a weird back and forth effect that doesn't build up speed in any particular direction. At worst, in those rare occasions when people push in different directions at the same time, it results in frustration and arguing over game priorities. <br/><br/>So this CA thing is really just about talking it out and making sure you all want to play the same kind of game. Is anyone at the table really interested in pursuing the "rules mastery" aspect of D&amp;D, which 4E is so good at? Certainly not you. I anyone at the table really interested in pursuing serious issues that make everyone else nod thoughtfully and say, "You know, I really had never thought of it that way" (or even, "wow, dude, that's really messed up!")? I don't get the impression that's a priority for you. <br/><br/>More likely, you want the group to all revel in "being" adventurers in this particular world of the DM's creation, being surprised at the wondrous things the DM puts in front of you, basking in the possibility of a fantasy world remarkably different than your real world circumstances, and so on. <br/><br/>CA isn't a personal agenda, exactly. It's a shared, group agenda, or it's nearly worthless. You already want a bunch of stuff and you're not getting it, or you would be writing a wholly different post. You want your fellow players and the DM to want the same things you want. If you all were on the same page, you'd be all pushing in the same direction and your games would be Awesome. <br/><br/>1. Figure out what personally brings the fun for you. Get specific. List examples. <br/><br/>2. Talk this over with the group. Maybe they have fun in a totally different way. If so, change how you have fun with this group or get a different group.<br/><br/>3. Figure out if you're using the right tools to "push" in the direction you want to go. 4E is good at game mastery stuff. Really, frighteningly good. So good that it's hard to ignore it when you want to do other things. Just about the time you're starting to bask in the glory of the fantasy world your DM has created, you level up and it's all about testing out your new class abilities on those trolls, and you're hooting and yelling at natural 20's instead of at fascinating character portrayals and picture-perfect moments of worldbuilding.<br/><br/>4. Pick the right tool, play, talk more. D&amp;D Next might be that tool! I don't know enough about it.<br/><br/><br/>If I managed to categorize the kind of play you like, properly and all, then look at these games:<br/><br/>* Pathfinder, if you want to stick to D&amp;D. It's basically 3E but it's better supported.<br/>* 13th Age, if you want to stick close to D&amp;D but want a little more support with worldbuilding stuff.<br/>* Labyrinth Lord (a Moldvay Basic D&amp;D clone), if you want much lighter rules.<br/><br/>If you want to go in a completely different direction, try one of these:<br/>* The Shadow of Yesterday: has an evocative setting and fiddly rules that you can use to flesh out characters in cool detail<br/>* Burning Wheel Gold: a "heavy" rules system that you can learn in stages, that gets deep into making statements about characters<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409027/#Comment_409027" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T14:26:00+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  2:26PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">@Callan_S</a><br/><br/>This thread is awesome!

If you find anything I said useful, credit CA. <br/><br/>I'm not recommending you have a big creative agenda jargon talk with your friends. That'd be a disaster. But definitely watch how they play and try to figure out what it is they're looking for during play. If you can all get on the same page somehow, your game will be better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>When people get together to play a  board game or team sport, you don't usually have to mess with this stuff. Everyone gets that the object of play is to "win." <br/><br/>Usually. I played a strategy board game with my friends and my wife. I didn't realize that my wife had a different play agenda which included "don't get screwed over by your husband." At the point that I did something mean to her, she didn't care about winning anymore. She just played kingmaker and made sure that I lost, taking me down with her. <br/><br/>Or you know those family volleyball games at picnics where one guy is playing cutthroat (spiking the ball, getting really mad when people miss a serve, etc.) and everyone else just wants to "have some fun." <br/><br/>Or you try to teach your 10 year-old nephew chess, and he insists on role-playing each of the pieces "sacrificing" themselves to save the queen. It looks like big fun and it follows the understood moves and turn order of chess, but without the competition, it's hardly the game you were expecting. Maybe you enjoy it as its own thing, maybe it's not your cup of tea.<br/><br/>These are mismatches of some kind of agenda.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409166/#Comment_409166" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T14:17:59+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  2:17PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a><br/><br/>I am suggesting more than just not identifying what we want.

Emotionally, the fights were more of the cutscenes for me. Long, obligatory, but most of all: hardly disassociable from the tactics expectaitons. There was a time when I couldn't make myself let the character of an absentee die, though I thought it would be more interesting while also making fictional sense (the cleric having plenty of other things to do at the moment in that fight). In the freeplay between fights, the weight of our decisions were not that high, so I was a bit less pressured about them. There were some times when I thought "man, this guy really doesn't tell us what to do in this dungeon room, let's do some interesting stuff", though we had our fair share of "we can either choose the direction smelling of adventure... or we can well, stall".  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409182/#Comment_409182" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T16:11:52+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  4:11PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Very interesting.

For me this is less of a cut scene than the combat encounters. (The rests just happen quickly, sometimes only on the character sheet, so no sense of choices there--illusory or not.) I read you showing two options: this "fluff stuff" doing something with combats or it being a cutscene. My impression is that it has nothing to do with combat while not being so much of a cut scene (non-interactive, longish, obligatory) either. They are where my choices are and the fights are the cut scenes wedged in (combat is not much of a choice if you have to win: it's optimization, game in a more narrow sense). I am not sure I've understood you perfectly the last time though, so if you have the same hunch, please tell me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409273/#Comment_409273" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T11:48:57+00:00" title="March 16, 2013 11:48AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a><br/><br/>I am suggesting more than just not identifying what we want.

Pun intended.</blockquote>\nLet me read  this back to you to make sure I understand what you're saying.<br/><br/>There are four people at the table. One is the GM. You are the second. There are two others. Who is the one "other vocal but separate" player "not even playing with us officially"? How is that person participating?<br/><br/>So you're all talking at the same time? Does it seem like people are talking and not listening? That's just plain bad behavior in any social endeavor. It sounds like your game is failing at the social contract level, not the creative agenda or exploration level. At its base, gaming is a social activity that requires people to talk and listen and interact. Ron Edwards used the analogy of a musical band. If people are all playing their own thing without listening to anyone else, it's not going to be music, let alone good music.<br/><br/>Now, second guessing yourself and getting lost in your own inner dialog is a different problem. Let's say that everyone shuts up for a moment and the GM asks you what you want to do. How do you contribute to the game in a way that you and everyone else appreciates? That's creative agenda, right? It's essentially a play aesthetic. You can overthink it, though, or you can just do what makes you happy. <br/><br/>The latter approach requires you to have some kind of internal guideline for how to play. For you, it's probably "do what 'my guy' would do in this situation, whatever that may be and wherever it takes us." Forget being "unexpected" or mirroring what the GM said. Play your character. Get into his or her head. Try that for a while. If it doesn't work for you, try something else. Some other obvious possibilities include "do what is tactically most intelligent" and "guide my character's actions like an author might, trying to tell a story about something meaningful." I suspect neither of those will work as well for you as just getting in the character's head though.<br/>\n<blockquote>+ This second one is fresh. Our DM from the stories of the OP said in an email as part of our current troubleshooting discussion that "the drawn out and repeating cycles of scenes in the village are disturbing me, as well." This seems very much like "These things are bad and they are happening despite us or the book rules" to me. If the one who has the mighty rule zero in one pocket and the handy GM fiat in another, I am prone to the thought he is encumbered more than the characters are.</blockquote>\nYour DM could be disturbed because he/she senses other players are bored, or because the DM prepared a huge dungeon that isn't getting used. Is anyone in those email discussions saying that they love the negotiations in the village?<br/><br/>The fix is pretty simple if everyone agrees: just stop those drawn out village scenes. What kind of play do you want to have? Do that. If you all enjoy heroic dungeon adventuring, just start at the door to the dungeon. Do you really need an excuse to be there? <br/><br/>But you originally said:\n<blockquote><br/>The weightless, meaningless wanderings between encounters (read: fighty fights) were basically the most interesting things as these were the occassions where the DM could show us his lovingly created world. The encounters were the obligatory roadblocks enabling and empowering me to these further questions about the worlds mysteries.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat kind of play do you want? I cannot tell if you're being a little sarcastic there. Is the world exploration actually what you want to do, or is it just more interesting than fighty-fights? <br/><br/><br/>So forget creative agenda and jargon. But, jesus, man, talk to your friends. Are they having fun? What parts are fun for them? What parts are not? Explain to them what your idea of a fun series of 5 adventures is like. What should happen in a campaign? What should happen in a typical session? How much of that should be spent in combat? How much of that should be spent in exploring dangerous areas? How much in role-playing with villagers?<br/><br/>And if more than one person is disturbed by long, drawn-out negotiations that don't benefit anyone and aren't fun for you, why hasn't anyone stopped the encounter /in the middle of it/ and said, "Bob, sorry, but this is a huge waste of our time. Can we get past this? No one but you cares about any of this"? <br/><br/>Imagine if we're playing Monopoly and I insist on converting all of my money to 1's and 5's every time it's my turn, taking up ten minutes of time every time I get the dice, counting out every bill aloud, wasting everyone's time. Why wouldn't you say something?<br/><br/>It's like people are afraid to criticize another player's input because by default it's within the boundaries of acceptable social behavior, because no one knows what the right way to play is, so no one wants to say, "Dude, that isn't the right way to play." Well, wrong. The right way to play is the way that entertains the entire group. Shit, you should all be /hanging on every word/ that every player is saying. One person should be talking at a time. It should be /bloody fascinating/ most of the time. If you do not care if Bob succeeds at the thing he's rolling dice for, why the fuck is he doing it? Why the fuck is the GM requiring a roll for it? If play has bogged down to "role-playing" (read: arguing in-character) as an attempt to trump all the dice, the GM can call for a die roll to close it up. "Fine, whatever, roll Diplomacy at DC 20 to convince them. 18? Sorry, it isn't going to work... No, you can't negotiate more now. Let's move on."<br/><br/>So everyone at the table is at fault for the shitty time everyone is having. Own that. Make it better. If your friends won't help (or if they're having fun but you're not), play with different friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409284/#Comment_409284" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T14:05:14+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  2:05PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">@Callan_S</a>\n<blockquote>A fascinating sequence of psychology - basically all the 'best' players (here 'best' means the more tactically attuned) get bored with the best move and go on to some other game entirely.

Like, I enjoy chess, love it, haven't played it in tournaments in years, but when I did, I discovered I was very bad at chess.  People who were exceptionally good at chess didn't get a lot of pleasure out of playing against me because my play is not going to teach them anything/show them anything/give them the experience they're seeking.  But people who were more on my level would really enjoy it.<br/><br/>To bring it back to D&amp;D, there's actually a really easy way to win D&amp;D3 - everyone play wizards, clerics or other full-caster classes and avoid direct-damage spells. Now, this is not an obvious way to play D&amp;D3 and the books push play in an entirely different direction.

Whereas people (like me) who are shit at D&amp;D3 don't see that option or don't evaluate it reasonably or pretend they don't, and they have a great time with D&amp;D3 and an exceptional experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409286/#Comment_409286" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T14:31:26+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  2:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>To bring it back to D&amp;D, there's actually a really easy way to win D&amp;D3 - everyone play wizards, clerics or other full-caster classes and avoid direct-damage spells.</blockquote>\nThis caught my attention.<br/><br/>How does that play out, exactly?

From simple things like finding the few no-Save spells to picking utility spells and arguing endlessly on how to apply them. (Don't get me started on Floating Disk...) Then if you get high enough level, Scry, Teleport, rinse repeat. If you are especially paranoid, use spells like Rope Trick to cast a single spell, hide, rest, regain spells, rinse repeat. Spells like Knock, Invisibility, or even Summon Mount and walk it into a trap will replace a rogue. And if you really must cause direct damage, find a Sonic spell since no creature has resistance to Sonic damage. Get Polymorph Self and all your above problems are solved.<br/><br/>Cleric has only half a gazillion ways to "win" except a Cleric has strong hit dice, can wear any armor, and can still wield a good weapon.

I thought this is clear but it's important.<br/>This between encounters thing had not too much to do with the mechanics (in 4E almost nothing), so I was not assured by book rules or written or verbally stated group rules to have any effect at all. I guess this removes a lot of confidence, thus fun, from me. Nevertheless these are the ones that have the faint hope of changing the direction or kicking the narrative to go somewhere in practice(!). This can be a CA clash, but I am not sure and I am not sure if BigModelling it is the easiest way to help myself: fights for me feel that I am not understood if I take suboptimal actions for my characters on purpose -- which in fact would be the only way to affect the situation on purpose. (E. g. the previous eample of not saving a dying PC.)<br/>In short: combat encounters: mostly I knew what I was supposed to do (optimize) but I didn't feel I had a say about the fiction. (During 4E combat we are talking about abtract numbers that doesn't mean nuffin' in the fiction. After the wole thing the fallout is you standing there victorious with some resources burned up or else, defeated, which means pretty much you are not following the story of that fictional team any more as they are dead, dead, dead.)<br/>             between encounters: I didn't know what I was supposed to do but sometimes I was struck by a gut feeling about "Well, this thing is interesting, let's stir this one up." Those were the moments of payoff for sitting through all the rest of the game.<br/><br/>I will return with yesterday's actual play.

The next game session after all those emails the group basically agreeing on not wanting to see the longish planning and haggling.<br/><br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>This is our D&amp;D Next playtest + Tegel Manor module campaign.<br/>The GM had some serious real-life issue which clearly was effecting his mood. (I don't like to blame life for bad gaming though, but I wanted to mention this in the name of more complete information.)<br/>We were three while usually we are four (3+GM). My fellow player was the guy with the haggling and recrouiting and shopping that frustrated me a lot before. He asked about how the PC of the absentee will work, and man, it was a real pain in the ass to try to explain the "fades into the background" shit: Haggling guy seemed very concerned about his picture of the fiction breaking down: "the barbarian who was our frontline in every fight until now not fighting just doesn't make any sense". The GM didn't want "an NPC solving your problems." (He is very good at looking at play as solving puzzles -- I am not sure he is enjoying it but he is good at it.) It was real hard shit for me to translate the GMs message to the new guy (he wasn't with us in the previous campaign). Probably because I wasn't sure about either the intents of the GM or the meaning of this tradgame advice "fading into the background." It was a crunch point--frustrating at the time but may carry a lot to learn.<br/>To even the odds (the missing player's character fading into the background) and for test purposes, I played two PCs this time. The new one being some kind of a test of my PC from the previous (4E Essentials) campaign rebuilt to D&amp;D Next. This could've effected our game in a lot of ways: 1) I gave this new char a different name and I was not attached this clone of my long-time PC. 2) This one was clearly above our regulars in power level (31 hp until disabled vs the 7 and 8 hp of the other two PCs)<br/>I mentioned before--in this thread and in the group emails--a pre-game discussion about what things to do and how and what is worth avoiding. We didn't have this descussion but I didn't feel the need for it that much as I felt we were much more on the same terms. (This actually proved to be true--or was I the one making it true? Let's see...)<br/><br/><br/>The Game:<br/><br/>We left our heroes actively exploring the Tegel Manor. The GM had me introduce the new PC. (Doing this was fun until haggling guy asked to re-state it in whole sentences. That was work. The same as answering him in-character--to tell the same thing again.)<br/>The GM told what the absentee's PC is doing while not coming with the rest of the group--later we could redirect him to do other not risky minor things though.<br/>And then, for me, a pretty unified experience started and kept on going until we finally had to go catch public transportation home. I refer to this as exploring the Tegel Manor or exploring the dungeon. We not-GM players did these: continued mapping, listened to GM's descriptions for dangers and treasure, evaluated our chances, tried our luck with doors and directions and--only once--a monster.<br/>It was this whole lot of mapping. First, I did this and the GM told us how does this looks like and I drew. I don't really know if this was fun for the other player but I sometimes checked on him and he seemed enticed. The map objects were pretty basic (mostly straight tunnels of the same width), so it was easy for the GM to tell me what to draw. I had some minor fun while doing this excercise. After exploring (me drawing) these tunnels somewhat--until it become unsafe for the PC's from my part*--we proceeded in a way more varied environment with rooms of different size. Mostly the GM mapped for us from that point--we two just gave the "commands"** like: "we continue in this corridor", "we peek in here", "we check for traps/listen in/open this door".<br/>Listening was for possible dangers and obvious signs of treasure in descriptions was another part. The haggling guy imagined a lot of possible things. He prepared to the most logical follow-ups from descriptions. They just never proved to be true. I don't know if he had a good time doing this, but I was just not assuming we can guess anything right from the descriptions, so I intentionally did pretty much anything randomly. I didn't care and when my fellow player's preparation for the--for him--obvious kind of danger included doing a whole lot of uninteresting things, I was overriding him with my veto of "okay, you can go, we'll do this without you anyway" of my two characters. He was never ever right, as I mentioned before, but if he was enjoying this not being right, than he was right in a more important sense.<br/>Taking on challenges, trying our luck (our characters' combat capability in other words): once he had the impression of the possible treasure is worthy of taking on some monsters. After we defeated some kind of ghost fairly easily, we said we search the room for treasure. The GM then said that we already searched it and it has no treasure. Before this, we had a nice accident with an ant-like devil materializing: we simply ran after I said fighting a bit with my stronger character might just not worth the life of the two (more important) 1st level characters' lives.<br/>It was very much alike the 4E Essential fights of our previous campaign ("I know what I am supposed to say and I say it again but it's as boring as last time or worse").<br/><br/>What worked:<br/>We explored this dungeon at a pace previously unimaginable. Our map has grown tenfold. We were bolder as we had the strong PC with us and we didn't had the longish conversations about village resupplies and haggling for followers and other support.<br/><br/>My questions:<br/>I am wondering if this was any better than just straight reading the module and dreaming about the possibilities (like a DM while prepping for a session)? In other words, what's the role of the GM and the other players? How is commanding PCs more interesting than a Roguelike video game? (I like them a lot.) Or reading a choose your adventure book for that matter.<br/><br/><br/>So this was our 4 hours of gaming yesterday evening. I would appreciate every response--be it a reflection, a suggestion or a question.<br/><br/>-----<br/>*I have a theory about the other player having fun: maybe he was all excited about what horrible death options could befall us while I was playing it safe (not caring about danger) and trying to enjoy the mapmaking. (Which, by the way felt like elementary school dictation and keeping record--correct lengths and directions versus correct spellings but very similar kind of challenge.)<br/><br/>**I used the word 'command' as it reminded me to parsley game texts: the GM does everything, he is our entertainer, we are just guessing. The difference is: a parsley parser role is very tongue-in-cheek while this one was the GM struggling while reading a badly printed map with room descriptions waiting to be deciphered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409731/#Comment_409731" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:31:46+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, no surprise: You finally got into the dungeon and play got less murky and more cohesive. D&amp;D is a ton of rules focused on dungeon play, and very few rules about negotiating with mule salesmen or whatever. When you're negotiating mule prices, you're totally left on your own. When you're in the dungeon, you have a billion queues on your character sheet and in the rule books for how things should go. In the dungeon, the stakes are clear to everyone. You need to deal with the ever present threat of the environment as a team or you're all gonna die. In the village, there's no good way for the team to negotiate for mules, and the stakes are unclear.<br/><br/>I'm curious. You talk about "commands." Did you ask for more information about the rooms? Or did the GM give such a complete infodump when you entered a room that you didn't feel you needed to inspect anything? Or was "I inspect the ___" one of the commands you gave?<br/><br/>The dungeon doesn't sound terribly exciting or dangerous. Were there any traps?

Probably because of this the tendency of everything blowing up or bestowing curses in the PCs faces--thus reducing our capabilities of speed-exploration of the place--we don't really think close inspection is a wise idea. So this thing is present, basically. I myself like doing these interactions with details. It feels less top-down than pure mapping. At the same time, I feel I am out of line when I risk my characters life for nobody-knows-if-anything.<br/><br/>No random wandering monsters yet. Traps are real but most of them could have been avoided by not inspecting room details, so far.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this fun, per se, but it was clearly different than the previous sessions.

I was not doing the mantra (check for traps, listen through door) the last session so one character got wounded. (That's not a huge deal if you're not in further danger, though.) Other traps were old paintings or figurines along the wall triggered by simply looking at them directly, once a painful (hp-affecting) scream through a door triggered by a listen check at the door.<br/>I do understand what you say. Interacting with all the little details is very alluring to me. But it is totally going against this game. The DM once spilled out that they can totally see the players learning not to touch anything as there is one hidden treasure for a lot of hidden traps. I think formalized, this means that not interacting with the environmental details (thus a lot of what he is saying) is the right thing to do.<br/>You know what? I should really do this thing (intentionally) and not be bothered by the other people sitting dumb-founded while I kill some PCs with all the horrible deaths in the Tegel Manor. I already take the most risk (yeah, I leave the haggling for others), but in practice I am still too much concerned about the expectations.<br/><br/><br/>Callan,<br/><br/>No, sadly the D&amp;D Next playtest document is like D&amp;D4E in this regard. (Thus far--it's not the final game, and I think they are testing the "class balance" more than anything else.) Instead of XP=gold, XP=stuff killed. PCs can get stronger only by killing stuff. I don't really believe in the kind of incentive XP is (in D&amp;D or in TSoY or BW for that matter) but if it works, it definitely works for a narrative very different to B\\X--Mortal Kombat maybe?<br/>Why I don't believe in it: in the previous game (4E Essentials) I wanted to have a fight a lot of times as it meant XP. But as soon as I was in the fight, I got bored and wished for some interesting fiction that can have more of an impact upon us. Levelling meant even less in terms of navigating the murk between fights in 4E than in Next. We might pick some fights now to improve our chances against traps.<br/>The end of my answer to <a href="/forums/profile/noclue">@noclue</a> applies here as well. What could happen if I don't care about pursuing the incentives (social wiring or XP) and I pursue fun instead? Like I said previously, not quite playing to lose but not playing to win either: letting myself experience every detail and every horrible deathtrap of the dungeon through my PCs. From here I can see this as the solution, but when I sit down with the group, their expectations become mine very soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409998/#Comment_409998" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T17:44:50+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  5:44PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the trick to D&amp;D Next is Playing D&amp;D wrong?<br/><br/>Fights should be fun; traps should be scary but the rewards of exploration should be worth the hazard.

Chargen feels like a cross between the two editions, but it gives players more authority to make shit up about the game world (custom backgrounds, relationships to the movers&amp;shakers of the setting, and One Unique Thing that sets the character apart from everyone else in the setting).<br/><br/>The combat system is lean and fast--almost as quick as Basic D&amp;D, but it takes a slight speed hit from the additional complexity that the class powers offer. It plays like a cross between 3E and 4E with a fair bit of OSR flavor. There's a clever Escalation Die mechanic to give the players a to-hit advantage as the rounds progress; this keeps combats from dragging on and on. There's a clever hit point recovery rule that encourages players to "play through" instead of running away when they're beat up; that avoids the "10 minute work day" problem in 3E. The class powers have a 4E feel to them but they're strongly connected to the fiction. No clerical "I hit you so hard that my friend gets a heal spell" weirdness.<br/><br/>The rest of the game plays like 3E, except that you have backgrounds instead of skills. Backgrounds are generic "cover all" history phrases that function as a group of skills that make sense for that history. The ranger can have a "head of the Assassin's Guild in Tenrook" background, and that stands in for a variety of skills in different situations: sneaky stuff, political stuff, seduction, disguise, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410444/#Comment_410444" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T01:32:32+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  1:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Today a session and actual play is on the horizon. We continue exploring and mapping like crazy, I guess. Maybe if I bring a player agenda other than "don't let your character die" and "get as big a map as you can", the game experience will get a whole lot better for me. And thus for others as well. Get as much XP as you can would result in some fighting and some spellslinging, which seems nice. "Let yourself engage with your favorite dungeon details" is still the most appealing--I'll try this one. My cleric will go heal the shit out of my less-than-cautious wizard.<br/><br/><br/>Callan,<br/><br/>I have no idea about what could pace up the game. AW pacing works because fronts are constantly engaging the PCs. I don't really know how could you make the dungeon the least bad thing to visit. You are so curious / greedy / blood-crazed that if you don't go down and engage with traps / treasure / monsters down in the dark, that you start to loose your stats / levels. I don't know. The thing is I honestly think that you can turtle in AW, too. It's just much more obvious that not turtling is responsible for the fun moments. All these sticks and carrots can only be pointers. You are the one to find what's in it for yourself. This is why I don't consider any game beyond repair.<br/>Please ask your question again. I don't know which one remained unanswered.<br/>I think it has potential just the same as each and every game. For example I quite like the B/X experience you referred to before. Maybe there are other modes of D&amp;D which I'd find enjoyable AND are not entirely out of reach for these sessions.<br/><br/><br/>Adam,<br/><br/>Thanks for the 13th Age intro. I like most of it. 10 minute work days returned in Next with most of the spells becoming daily (Vancian) again. That's awful. How does 13th Age do this? Are spells 4E-ian instead of Vancian or what? Another thing: what are you getting XP for in that game? Playing your character sheet (BW and TSoY style) or killing stuff (4E style) or some other thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410460/#Comment_410460" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T08:04:14+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  8:04AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/czipeter">@czipeter</a>:\n<blockquote>...with most of the spells becoming daily (Vancian) again. That's awful</blockquote>\nCan you unpack this? I'm curious about the anti-Vancian attitude I often hear. Have you read Vance? His magic was actually really cool. Even powerful wizards could only hold 3-4 spells in their heads at any point in time, no duplicates. Wizards ended up having to live off of their wits, or lived in palaces filled to the brim with traps. And they LITERALLY forgot the spell once it was cast, often having to spend hours re-memorizing it.

I'm curious about the anti-Vancian attitude I often hear. Have you read Vance? His magic was actually really cool. Even powerful wizards could only hold 3-4 spells in their heads at any point in time, no duplicates. Wizards ended up having to live off of their wits, or lived in palaces filled to the brim with traps. <br/><br/>And they LITERALLY forgot the spell once it was cast, often having to spend hours re-memorizing it. A spell book (usually containing just one spell per book) was hugely valuable; and devastating if lost or stolen. Wizards often bragged to each other about how many spells they could hold (often lying).

I don't remember any Dying Earth stories where any of the logistical difficulties of spellcasting actually presented a problem for the main character.  In fact, the Vance stories that actually starred a dedicated wizard had him "cheat" by essentially having servant genies do all his tasks rather than lower himself to actually casting a spell.<br/><br/>All of which is super-cool flavor for a story, but provides immense logistical problems when taken at face value and used as rules of engagement for a game about risk management, which is my problem with "Vancian casting" as it is usually meant.  I like the version of Vancian casting in the actual Dying Earth RPG, because it keeps it in the original context it was created in and doesn't graft it onto a survival horror game.<br/><br/>Also, (admittedly based on one session with the very first playtest packet of 13th Age), the 4e influence on 13th Age seems almost nonexistent. The things 4e fans say they like about it (meaningful tactical movement, teamwork and synergy during battle, transparent math) did not seem evident to me, and what was there was basically D20 with some story-game influence in things like the Icons and One Unique Thing. Caster classes had some powers that could be used at will or refreshed faster than once per day, but those aren't at all things unique to 4th in the D&amp;D tradition. I do think 13th Age is a more interesting D&amp;D than 3.x, but as someone who swore off D&amp;D 3.x, it didn't fix enough of my peeves to bring me back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410465/#Comment_410465" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T09:21:32+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  9:21AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2013 9:21AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post, arrgh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410469/#Comment_410469" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T10:14:11+00:00" title="March 26, 2013 10:14AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, there are some Vance stories--at least one, anyway--where the protagonist arms himself by "encompassing" a handful of spells, which turn out to be exactly what's needed to deal with the obstacles the subsequent story throws out.

They go into a dungeon. In the first room or two, they encounter some monsters and other obstacles. They use up all of their spells, or most of their good ones. Now it's tactically foolish to continue on. They either retreat and come back the next day, hoping that the rooms they cleared aren't populated again, or they make camp in the room they cleared and rest a day to get more spells. Elapsed encounter time: ten minutes (more likely, an hour or two). It's not very heroic.<br/><br/>13th Age handles recoveries differently. There are "daily" spells and powers, but "daily" is not defined in terms of the sun going down. It's defined as "four good combat encounters." So if you have completed three combat encounters, and you're running out of spells and powers, you need to press on and complete the next encounter to reset.<br/><br/>Sure, you always have the option to back out and rest and recharge, but this is considered a retreat, and the party suffers a "story setback" (GM-defined).<br/><br/>Additionally, a lot of "daily" spells have a chance to recharge after an encounter. It's usually something like "Recharge on 16+ (on d20)."<br/><br/><br/>By the way, "Vancian magic" really has two meanings. There's the "memorize, fire and forget" aspect of it, but there's also the "florid names and a million varieties of each spell" aspect of it, too. 13th Age embraces both, as options for wizard characters.<br/><br/><br/>Joe,<br/><br/>The 4e influence on 13th Age is there in terms of conditions, class builds, and so on. I mean, Rob Heinsoo is one of the 13th Age developers. The game has some of the elements you mention. Teamwork and synergy during battle are in 13th Age, but 4e takes them to the pinnacle of play. <br/><br/>If you don't like D&amp;D, you probably won't like 13th Age. If you like D&amp;D, but have issues with it, 13th Age might fix some of those issues.<br/><br/><br/>Maybe we should start a 13th Age thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410475/#Comment_410475" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T11:45:38+00:00" title="March 26, 2013 11:45AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            re: ten-minute workday- OK, I can see that.

The thing is I honestly think that you can turtle in AW, too. It's just much more obvious that not turtling is responsible for the fun moments. All these sticks and carrots can only be pointers. You are the one to find what's in it for yourself.

Completely non traditional, but it doesn't rely on sticks and carrots, the game just dictates what you do next.<br/><br/>Second idea: Once you're in the dungeon, if you don't get to an objective in X amount of real life time (again, an egg timer), then the max level your character can get to is reduced by one. If your character ever gets to their max level, that's it, they can level no more (even if they meet latter objectives). If their max level is reduced, each time they meet an objective they can roll percentile and if they get 10% or lower, their max level is raised back up by one (max it can be returned to is the top level)\n<blockquote>For example I quite like the B/X experience you referred to before.

You're current GM lays on very little adversity at all.<br/><br/>While the game doesn't force the GM to provide a minimum of X amount of adversity, then your game will always be very GM centric in regrard to what play is like.<br/><br/>Do you want to take choice on how much adversity is present (partially) out of the GM's hands?<br/><br/>If not, and if you stick with this GM, then play will remain like this till the end of time.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410501/#Comment_410501" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T17:19:08+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  5:19PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will soon return with Tuesday's actual play.

The friends I play with put a high priority on fun in-character interactions (conversations, bickering, bantering, etc.), and most of them tend to "buddy up" with another player -- someone they can always turn to and do <i>something</i> with in-character. Siblings who miss their parents, ex-spouses who have old grudges, business partners with different Big Ideas, that sort of thing. Whatever appeals to both players and gives them plenty of grist for the in-character conversation mill, basically.<br/><br/>If that's not something you like in gaming, then forget I mentioned it. If it is something you like, though, you might consider trying to bring it into this D&amp;D game to see if it helps you have more fun with it.<br/><br/><br/>edit to add: One nice thing about buddying-up with another player for in-character interactions is that it generally doesn't require you to steal spotlight time from other players or monopolize the GM's attention or otherwise interrupt the flow of the game, because it's something that players can do on their own. (My group tends to pay attention because we all like that kind of thing and get a kick out of watching it, but that's us -- it doesn't need to get in the way of mapping and fighting and the rest of the D&amp;D milieu, so you don't have to worry about being like the guy who haggled with every NPC he met.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410576/#Comment_410576" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T10:10:42+00:00" title="March 27, 2013 10:10AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2013 10:19AM by czipeter.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual Play of Tuesday:<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>All four of us involved in this campaign so far were present. I had 2 pc-s (the 4th level, magic-itemized dwarf cleric and the 1st level elven wizard), the others had one each (the 1st level thief of Mr. Haggler and the 1st level barbarian of the other). We told some things to the third player about what happened when he was absent and what are the 3 A4 pages of maps--made without him--roughly about. After this we jumped into exploring some more.<br/>My own setup in my head was--as I previously announced here twice--that I will explore the personally most interesting areas even if they could be very well traps and thus the end of my characters.<br/><br/>Play:<br/><br/>Haggler guy was still suspiciously enthusiastic throughout the whole game. He still had those notions about the logical progression of monster strength towards the inside of the building (in spite of the meeting a demon right next to the entrance chamber the last session). He was also desperately constructing the idea of the big money somewhere: "The big money is here!" (points to a room on the map) one time "Oh, yes, of course the treasure of the baron must be here!" (points to another unexplored location). And he is not put off after whole sessions without any sign of treasure. I curiously want to read his face after every occassion of not finding anything valuable in the places of his "big money" and I am not sure what I am seeing. He seems like already engaged in the next plan of getting the big money in the next location. He found money in this adventure, though. The means of it? Once the GM described a wardrobe with actors' outfits. He declared searching their pockets. He found 1d10 (5) gold coins. Another time he declared searching a hearth in an empty dining room. Found an iron chest under the fireplace. It was a treasure chest. (The first one in 5 sessions or so--we found treasure once before, in the second session.)<br/>When he levelled, he chose a persuasion based piece of rule advantage to his character. Once a day, he could turn a simple--it's simple when the DM allows you to roll for it, you know--persuasion success to a Charm spell. I tried to frame my concerns about that this probably won't see much use with this DM-player disconnect about character-NPC interaction, but again: he was either too enthusiastic or simply foolish to see my face going like .<br/>The DM first has his attention divided between us and the new playtest rules of Next. I asked him 3 times to start listening to us.<br/>There was a time when he was a bit angry at us because we hadn't got our equipment items listed by location. I didn't like it but started to list all the items with placements for one of my characters. I don't know if the others really started to do their homework at all or not. I think listing your things and their placement is not time well-spent.<br/>When we finally fleed the demon again, he was like "Why is it needed to put this high-level a monster so close to the entry?". I couldn't help but ask him: "Which one of us are you asking this question from?"<br/>About the 4th guy: he is most quiet during these sessions and this was no exception. He speaks only when the DM is asking him in particular or when the other PC players cannot agree on some thing. He told me several times that he is basically not interested in this dungeoneering stuff but he likes to play his character every now and then. He has thought about quitting the sessions but hasn't shared this idea before with us.<br/>Last but not least: me, myself and I. I followed the "let's engage with what we have" model what I already worded in this thread as a possible path for me to go down on. The theory behind it was not clear in my head but now it's pretty simple: my job is not to save my characters' skin--I could retire every one of them if it were. My job is to go down every possible corridor, every hallway, use every stairway, search every room, pull every lever and... do what feels like new for me, what has an uncertain outcome. Okay, enough poetry. My wizard waited for an animated paintbrush to make his portrait--he turned to stone. Some minutes later the haggler guy was a bit strange: he wanted us to kill the demon near the entrance out of sudden anger. I was a bit surprised but I'd never let such a golden opportunity slip. The party rested to level, prepared and attacked the thing in it's room. It single handedly killed the high-level-high-defense dwarf cleric (my second character), the other two PCs ran away. Luckily I had another pregen with me, so I could join in soon. My play was bordering on cautiousness again but not badly so.<br/><br/><br/>On my part, this session was felt very close to the halfling team attacking the ghouls in the very first room in that other thread. I have had this same dissatisfaction and discouraged feeling after my first old-school game ever, so maybe it's my total lack of perception caused by some previous trad or indie brain damage.<br/><br/>Man, I'm so glad I am running DW tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410600/#Comment_410600" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T13:48:58+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  1:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you running DW for these same people?

Only me and the GM know each other from the beginning or the previous campaign (more than a year). Haggler guy joined us at the beginning of this campaign (6 sessions) and the 3rd PC player was with us in the last 6 sessions of the previous one already (12 sessions altogether). We have no other common areas in our lives but I used to love to speak to the GM guy outside gaming and I still do when I arrive the earliest to his place. Haggler guy is kind of a mystery to me, I don't know nothing about his non-RPGer life, which is most of it. I wonder why he is not talking about himself. Probably we don't really click, and I readily give him some more time. I am on very good terms with the last one, mostly due to the common situation, I guess. (I mean, I liked the GM guy better until gaming problems started to show and create this atmosphere smelling of gunpowder.)<br/>The previous campaign was different. It was a not too good manifestation of 4E Essentials (I can elaborate on this further if asked) with a very creative, thought out, thus atomspheric backdrop/ setting / world worth just running around in it. Even if we only had so much of an effect on our characters' actions (the GM is not the improv guy and 4E IMO is not the improv rules, either) and the world even less. It wasn't what I'd call a really good game but the GM's caring clearly raised it to the level "not bad" for me. (Compare the words "lovingly created world" from the OP with " his attention divided between us and the new playtest rules of Next" from my last one.)<br/>I agree that I am not in the state of giving this current game any more fair trials and I want to have a good rest before I rejoin that group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410610/#Comment_410610" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T15:07:03+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  3:07PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2013 3:08PM by czipeter.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>No, not them.

(He has us come up with a background ("Where are they coming from?") and motivation ("Why are they entering the Manor?") if we want to introduce a new character.) He was puzzled how I was even thinking of this. "He is level 7... and not even a fighter." Like these were stated before. In fact not at all. I can get really pissed at gamer conventions taken as obvious rules--we are not really talking about the level and class here, I suggest: it's about "don't take my NPC away, it's not how it goes". Probably because it makes it harder to separate them from the meat myself.

If there's a chest, for example, and you never say you open it but then get angry when the GM says you never looked inside it for treasure, that's missplaced anger.<br/><br/>Again, that's just a convention, but one I'm fine with, anyway.\n<blockquote>When I mentioned that I shall stay away from these games for a week or two, he was asking "wtf?".</blockquote>\nWas there any indication from him for how many sessions you were to play for?<br/><br/>I dunno, without any fixed agreement on how many sessions A: what, did he expect you were married to the group and would play forever? Rediculous! And B: You gave a few sessions a try before withdrawing - that's a good effort on your part.<br/><br/>I'm guessing he has never thought about how long he wants players to play in a campaign for, and has essentially defaulted to an irrational expectation of forever. Of course the irrational always see others as the abberation, so he's all 'wtf?' in responce to you withdrawing from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410823/#Comment_410823" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T05:22:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  5:22AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2013 5:22AM by czipeter.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/><br/>Me taking over an NPC: you are right about conventions in general but I think my convention is not the rule of "it's okay to make an NPC a PC", but rather "it might be okay to make an NPC a PC", or in other words "I shouldn't attach the phrases &gt;&gt;how about ... ? do you like it?&lt;&lt; " around my moves.
