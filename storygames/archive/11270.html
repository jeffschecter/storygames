I hope someone here can provide answers!<br/>\n<br/>\nScrip sheets: At the start of a session, each player lists their character's thematic batteries, and as they do so, the other players note them on their own scrip sheet.  Do players note their own character's thematic batteries on their own scrip sheet?  For instance, if Alice, Bob, and Charlie are players (with Dennis as GM), are there three scrip sheets each with three sets of batteries, or are there three sheets each with two sets of batteries?<br/>\n<br/>\nDice rolling: If a character is using Coordination 3 and Weightless 3 to perform some task, I take it they roll four dice and count the third-smallest die twice to make their total.  So if they rolled 1 3 5 6, their total would be 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nPromotions and demotions: Can a promotion of +2 be split into two +1 promotions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250291/#Comment_250291" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T06:28:55+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  6:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scrip sheets/thematic batteries: The best thing to do is for everyone to make nameplates with their characters thematic batteries, then you can just use a blank slip of paper for scrips.<br/>\n<br/>\nDice rolling: Yes<br/>\n<br/>\nPromotions: I'm pretty sure you can.
