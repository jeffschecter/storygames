Whether accomplishing something with a single roll is OK depends on <i>pacing</i> in the context of the narrative. Any single fictional task you might imagine would be perfectly acceptable as a single roll in all three of these games as long as taking the roll would be neither too insignificant to hold the group's interest nor too momentous so as to cause the depth of the narrative to suffer. Obviously you need some sort of pacing, as you don't want to get stuck fiddling with minor details, but you don't want to obviate your interesting set-up by skipping the meat of it on a pro forma dice roll.<br/><br/>I mean, overthrowing a king on a single roll would be perfectly acceptable if the king were not a focus of play and the dramatic arc required it to be over with quickly and without hassle. Most flexible dramatic games give you pacing discretion for exactly this reason: we don't know in advance whether any single type of activity will be sufficiently important to make a big deal of. D&amp;D tells us that a swordfight is <i>always</i> worthy of a few dozen dice rolls, but all these stakes-setting games with universal conflict resolution systems specifically leave these decisions to play.<br/><br/>For this reason the game designer often has to make the choice: either he gives some simplistic rules of thumb to carry people over - and most importantly, cause them to pay attention to the issue - or he has to give real names to the issues of skill involved, and then teach players to make choices accordingly. "You can't achieve your most important goal in a single roll, even if you're constantly achieving smaller things on single rolls" is a reasonable rule of thumb about how stories need can't happen without pacing, while pacing a story would be the underlying skill that makes the simple rule of thumb redundant.<br/><br/>(Obviously enough most games also include rules about pacing instead of just advice, it's one of the top three rules mechanics topics alongside resolution and framing. Most games don't have universal pacing rules, though, which requires the players to display some skill of their own.)<br/><br/>I should also note that Jesse's practical "How?"-heuristic is an excellent pacing tool for games where players might otherwise be prone to disassociative narration. The reason it works is that it enforces fictional positioning: you certainly can get the ancient sword on a single roll, but only if you've already positioned your character in the fiction such that you can clearly describe your eventual success. And you'll only basically be able to do this if the preceding events in play have sufficiently dealt with everything between you and the sword. This works for many games, as positioning and pacing are so often intertwined.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388150/#Comment_388150" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T19:07:43+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:07PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I should also note that Jesse's practical "How?"-heuristic is an excellent pacing tool for games where players might otherwise be prone to disassociative narration.

Here was my mental dilemma: "What if the really little guy wants to slay the mighty dragon...would one roll work?"<br/><br/>At first, I tried all sorts of crazy luck/extraordinary circumstance mechanics...all to no avail. Then I thought about "positioning" (which I find a very appropriate term for this - you'll see why). <br/><br/>Compare positioning to the endgame in chess where you are on the path to victory. Every move you make can bring you a step closer to checkmate. Literally, however, you have to position your pieces correctly (or at least pretty well). Failure to do so could cost you an win.<br/><br/>I realized that a "how do you do this" questioning system forces a player to think along these lines. By incorporating this simple clause, the player must act cleverly. It's very much like Socratic education - drawing the answers from within the player/student!<br/><br/>(Ultimately, the little guy slays the dragon by hiding in its lair until it is asleep, quietly sneaking toward the precipice above his head, careful not to slip in the dragon's mighty drool, and drives his spear directly into the terrible beast's skull! I count at least three or four rolls there)<br/><br/>~K.G.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
