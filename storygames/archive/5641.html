The NerdSoCal crew traditionally gathers at the bar to have a drink, share war stories and meet old and new friends.  We are meeting at the Top of the Radisson bar (if it's closed for some reason we'll do it in the lobby bar) at 7:00 P.M.<i>ish</i> Friday night.  <br/><br/>Just two days to go.  I look forward to meeting everybody who is coming in from out of town.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126219/#Comment_126219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T11:03:04+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 11:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, for anyone who isn't in an 8pm Friday night game I wouldn't mind grabbing a few people for a One Can Have Her game in Open Gaming.  It's the only game in my "official" line up that I haven't played before and getting a chance to do so outside the confines of the "official" 8pm Saturday slot would be of great value to me.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
