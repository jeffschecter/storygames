Here goes:<br/><br/>How would you approach a game where all the PCs are Space Fighter Pilots?  (Think Rogue Squadron and its ilk).<br/><br/>My concerns are that the game would rob the players of things to do outside of, well, blowing things up in space.  However, I think a bunch of cool quirks could make for amazing stories (flashbacks to their days at the academy, an "I've got your back" trait, etc.).  What do y'all think?<br/><br/>~Klaus                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cczernia" title="cczernia"><img alt="cczernia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zerneeak.com/avatar_mini.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cczernia">cczernia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338514/#Comment_338514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T17:37:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  5:37PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might take a look at Mecha where everyone is Mecha pilots.

I'd begun this campaign of outer-space fighter pilots in high school and grown it into an ongoing, years-long war against a mysterious and overwhelming alien foe. It spanned several different campaigns, some of which were running concurrently with different groups in different theaters of the same interstellar war. We played space marines and, yes, fighter pilots. <br/><br/>This would've been back around 1996-98. (We were inspired by <i>Space: Above and Beyond</i> and <i>Macross Plus</i> and <i>Wing Commander</i>.) A lot of what we cooked up for that campaign was later echoed with eerie accuracy by <i>Halo</i>'s various incarnations.<br/><br/>We got all kinds of mileage out of the idea by loading the game up with conflicts, rivalries, and soap-opera-worthy dramas between missions. The pilots weren't pilots, they were people in an insane profession, lucky to make it back from work every day. Our scenarios asked questions about duty and honor, responsibility and authority. Is it worth putting your squadron's star pilot through a court martial that could damage unit morale for the sake of upholding a semblance of the laws you're supposedly fighting for or is it better to let her infractions go so that she can save enough lives to populate a moon? That sort of thing.<br/><br/>We got into the culture of fighter pilots in a big way. We tapped WWI, WWII, and modern-day aviation culture for stories and characters. We had bomber crews careening through space like WWII crews, on their own for however long it took them to deliver ordinance and return alive, if they could. We made sure our pilots were trained to defend themselves if they got shot down and had to engage in the occasional ground-based "situation" (i.e. story). We had a few two-seat fighters so that players could pair up and try out different tactics.<br/><br/>I ran that game hardcore for years for dozens of players. It's the game that taught me that hierarchy is not necessarily a problem for player groups\u2014a mix of autonomy and direct orders can go a long way. I learned a ton about dramatic tricks like mid-combat flashbacks (consider the whole story that unfolded during a single alien dogfight, flashing back and forth between aerospace maneuvers and a foosball game against a rival squadron's star aces) and how to work the throttle between wholly open-ended situation-driven adventures and very tightly plotted missions ("This adventure tells the story about how a familiar starship is destroyed in battle; how many people are on it when it explodes is up to you."). A military-based campaign can provide a lot of precious structure while allowing players a nice, defined space in which to play\u2014explicit limits on their behavior are good, so they know just when and how they can push the boundaries without breaking the campaign.<br/><br/>Back in the day, I had high hopes that I would turn that campaign into a real, honest-to-God RPG of its own, packaging up all of my experience from hours and hours of play and all the background and details we concocted in our player groups. It was sci-fi military heartbreaker. It was about nine days into my first tour in the RPG industry, though, that I was told to get in line, that sci-fi games don't sell, that everyone has a space-marine game they want to publish, and on and on. The sad thing is, that advice wasn't necessarily wrong\u2014the market would not necessarily look kindly on more sci-fi military antics.<br/><br/>Short version: I can't talk about this just a little bit. I'd rather write a book about it.<br/><br/>To fit the scope of a forum post, then, I can only say: It can be done. It can be phenomenal. Don't limit yourself to what goes on in the cockpit and remember that every space battle can (should?) be about something other than a space battle.<br/><br/>Go forth and conquer. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338564/#Comment_338564" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T04:32:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  4:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2011 1:51PM by mease19.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will, that sounds really cool.  <br/><br/>It might be interesting to assume that the PCs are going to survive a large battle but have the question be: what are acceptable losses among the other pilots?  How many friends can they lose?  <br/><br/>Pilot training might also be fun.  Start at academy and do lots of drama in the flight sims.  <br/><br/>You could probably mix it up (perhaps alternate it with something like Microscope) to do  The Forever War meets The Foundation wherein pilots are sent out in suspended animation, fight, and return decades or centuries later to worlds they may not understand.  Each mission is a one way ticket and the world moves on without them.

But in every case, by letting things flow from the characters, and making the battles something that tests the characters' relationships and dedication to their mission and each other, we've had success more often than not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338606/#Comment_338606" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T13:06:45+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  1:06PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all,<br/><br/>It might take a bit for all this advice to gel in my head, but so far, I am overwhelmingly impressed by this feedback!!!<br/><br/>Will, I love what you said about this being "people in an insane profession" and, for that matter, everything else in that post!  It all really hit home with me, and is almost certainly full of ideas I will run with.  <br/><br/>I think that one of the keys is definitely going to be that "combat is more than just combat."  This was in the back of my mind, and falls in line with my own philosophy that in a story, a character doesn't just go into conflict for the sake of going into conflict, but rather to advance the story toward something more.  I'm still not 100% sure how to do this, but I will certainly have a lot to think about as I continue along.<br/><br/>I'll definitely have to check out a bunch of the links/games that everyone recommended.  I wish I had more specific questions at this point.  I'm only just returning to the project (after a summer working as a collegiate teacher, I was a bit busy), but as the ideas form, I'll try to keep people posted.
