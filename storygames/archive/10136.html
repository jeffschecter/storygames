Chuck had mentioned that this was his normal archetype of PC, which was interesting because other than the couple of S7S sessions we\u2019ve had, I\u2019d never gamed with him before.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get more info on his playstyle, but it was something I kept in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>The story begins in Lady Blackbird with the crew of The Owl haven just been captured by a huge Imperial Naval ship called The Hand of Sorrow.  I opened the scene with all five members of the crew: NPC Lady Blackbird (noble who hired The Owl to smuggle her away from an arranged marriage into the arms of her ex-lover, a pirate sorcerer), NPC Snargle (goblin pilot of The Owl), NPC Kale Arkam (first mate and best friend of the captain, a thief and petty sorcerer) and Cyrus Vance and Naomi Bishop.  I described the surroundings to Mick specifically as Naomi was waking up with something cool and wet on her forehead and the sound of a woman singing.  Naomi rose up to find that Lady Blackbird was softly wiping blood off of her forehead and worried humming a tune to soothe her.  I told Naomi that she had fought the Imperials from The Hand of Sorrow when they boarded The Owl and was beaten down by belaying pins.<br/><br/>Vance and Naomi quickly decided they needed to get out ASAP before The Hand of Sorrow discovered they had captured Lady Blackbird.  Vance called a guard over (who I described was one of the guards who had beaten Naomi down when The Owl was taken captive).  Vance then teleported out of the cell (a power he could use once per session) and shoved the guard into the bars of the jail cell where Naomi reached through and savaged the man mercilessly.  I asked Mick if Naomi knocked out the guard or killed him.  Mick said, \u201cShe\u2019s an ex-slave who was just beaten and captured, she is killing this guy.\u201d<br/><br/>The part crept out of the jail and Naomi attacked the three remaining guards outside their cell.  When Mick rolled for Naomi on this Difficult task of defeating the three guards (two female, one male guard, I explained), he got six successes.  I asked if Naomi defeated or if she murdered these three guards, and Mick hesitated, but said, \u201cYes, she would kill them, too.\u201d  Chuck stepped up and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Vance would stand for that.\u201d  I made a quick ruling that Chuck could roll against Mick and use his successes to take down Mick\u2019s, meaning, I let Mick have complete narration because he succeeded so well (didn\u2019t just defeat the guards, but defeated them utterly).  So if Chuck had successes, he could apply them against Mick\u2019s, taking Mick\u2019s successes down to just barely making it.  I hope that makes sense, but the players got it.  Chuck pulled in his PC\u2019s Command and Rank tags to aide the roll.  When he succeeded, I asked him to describe how he was able to control Naomi.  Chuck replied that with a commanding voice, Vance ordered, \u201cNot in front of the lady!\u201d which was a nice nod to his PC\u2019s Key of hidden affection for Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>After Naomi finished dispatching the guard single-handedly and the party saw exactly how bad*pickles* Naomi really was, I threw in a comment from the NPC Snargle as he asked nobody in particular, \u201cIs it wrong for me to have an erection right now?\u201d  Naomi and Vance started collecting their equipment from the locker where it was stowed and saw Mr. Arkam beginning to disrobe one of the unconscious female guards.  Naomi walked over to cuff him and Vance asked Arkam what he thought he was doing, so Arkam replied quickly, \u201cWe can disguise ourselves as guards!\u201d   Vance ordered Arkam to disrobe the male guards instead, which he did with some grousing.<br/><br/>The next scene was the escape.  Since there were four guards\u2019 uniforms and the crew numbered five, Naomi agreed to be \u201cthe prisoner\u201d, which was good since Naomi refused to wear the clothing of the oppressors.  I boiled this down to a single conflict roll requiring four successes [by this point, I was starting to push the players into burning up points from their Pool to force them to have a refreshment scene later], then asked the players to list what traits and tags they were bringing to bear so they could frame it in the description of what happened.<br/><br/>They both made it safely to the hangar bay where The Owl was suspended above some gigantic Bombay doors by a magnetic crane.  One more conflict roll [this one used up their remaining pool, which worked well to set up refreshment scenes on the ship after escaping] which ended up with Vance ordering the crane operator to move The Owl while Naomi threw ethereal grenades around causing much havoc while the crew dashed onto the ship later, and they had escaped The Hand of Sorrow.<br/><br/>The night was nearly over, so we ended with a couple refreshment scenes.  Chuck began by describing a brief scene where Vance remembered his days as an Imperial officer sitting at a table with some of his good friends, playing cards.  He framed the scene as a nod to the card game the guards were playing before as a reflection of Vance on how things looked from both sides for him.  This flashback took place as Vance was watching The Hand of Sorrow disappearing in the clouds.<br/><br/>Mick had Naomi approach Vance after his reverie and the two had a small discussion.  Naomi expressed to Vance that the Imperials made her the fighter she was, but she was afraid that it was all she\u2019d become, and she didn\u2019t want to be the demon she was.  Vance replied that Naomi was an excellent soldier, which Naomi corrected she was a warrior, undisciplined and violent.  She thanked Vance for stopping her from murdering the guards and the scene ended.<br/><br/>The three of us enjoyed the loose system and evocative setting immensely.  We hope to revisit this game soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225059/#Comment_225059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:01:44+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:01AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ethereal grenades.
