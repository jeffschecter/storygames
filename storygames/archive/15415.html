We are not really the typical new-wave players, so any advice how to improve the experience would be nice. Or if you see something you'd like to point out in my play report, please go ahead.<br/>I used the Temple of Ungu demo by Jason Morningstar, but i added a little twist. There was a human village around the temple, and the goblins were the slaves of the villagers, forced by the humans to stay in the temple during the night. I used the treasure cards, but i also added to some, that if the plyars give it back, they can get some gold and 1 xp instead of the treasure, thus further increasing the xp flow. We leveled at 5 xp, as suggested by the demo. The fighter got to level 3, the others to level 2 by the end of the game.<br/>The characters were the fighter, the thief and the wizard. There was a pretty nice background story created, the fighter seeking revenge against Florimel, while the wizard wanted to get her heart <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> as a component to create a golem. Too bad none of this came into play. Some suggestions on how to involve the background into the actual story would be nice.<br/>I actually allowed them to roll for their abilities, but the thief rolled very badly, she only got one +1, the rest of her abilities were 0. This made the game for her a bit of a suffering, so i think i should've allowed to use the predetermined values even after the rolls.<br/>When explaining the rules, i forgot to mention that 6- is always a failure, meaning bad things for them, and the GM never rolls a dice. This caused a little bit of confusion, when it happened the first time. This is my mistake of course, but i also think, this wouldn't have happened in Apocalypse world, as there the miss is alway detailed, so there is no place for misunderstanding.<br/><br/>Some questions:<br/>1. I have the feeling that the moves should be initiated by the players. So, when for example, an NPC would try to sneak on them, how should i handle that? It just doesn't seem right to tell them to roll a Discern Realities.. In other words how do you handle passive perception checks?<br/>2. I had trouble with the baby spiders, i couldn't really handle them. Can i use the monster moves, like the split of web fluid, just whenever i feel? <br/>3. How do i handle actions that are not in one of the moves? For example, the thief trying to ignite the spider web, in the web filled room. I used Defy Danger, but instead of DEX, rolled for INT. Does that sound about right? <br/><br/>Some highlights: <br/><br/>The thief, while trying to scare away the baby spiders with a torch, accidentally ignited the wizard, who was already covered in spider spit. This was a 7-9 result from the thief, and i told her that either she ignites the wizard or she gets overrun by the spiders. She chose to ignite the wizard. I just said that it would be a 3 hp ap hit. Does that sound about right way to deal with this situation?<br/>When they entered the chamber of Florimel (climbing down the slippery slope with a rope), there was nobody at sight, so they entered, except for the wizard who stayed in the tunnel. When he heard a big something sliding down at him, he embraced himself with his quarterstaff held firmly. It didn't quite work out as planned, as Florimel arrived with great speed pushing the wizard out of the tunnel and falling on him. This was a failed Hack'n'Slash from the wizard i think, so i said he takes damage, but also gets under florimel. In retrospect, i think i should've ask for a saving throw before deciding he gets under her body.<br/>After this, very much to my surprise, they killed Florimel in 2 actions. The fighter with a weak success, dealing 8 hp damage, then the wizard, with an empowered magic missile damaging 12 (after armor), so there she went... Wasn't very epic, but i think this was the point where the characters really felt cool.<br/><br/>All in all, i enjoyed the game, the 4 hours went by pretty fast. I think even though there were hickups, the others also liked it. Also, except for some uncertainity (the perception rules and the handling of 7-9 results in general) i felt the fictional events came to me quite easily based on the moves and everything. I asked them if they would like to try Apocalypse World as well, and they said yes.<br/><br/>[By the way, please forgive me if sometimes i express myself strangely. English is not my natural language.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350094/#Comment_350094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T19:26:00+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  7:26PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, where did you get Temple of Ungu and where can I get a copy?<br/><br/>1. If they happen to be Discerning Realities at the time, they can catch the guy. If they are doing something else and get a 6-, there's a good chance his sneak attack could be the result. If they get a 7-9 on something, maybe they see a snatch of something moving in the shadows (Announce Future Badness).<br/><br/>2. I'm not really sure, since I don't have the reference materials.<br/><br/>3. I wouldn't even really make this a move. Unless there's a reason to roll, you don't need to roll. Remember, to do it, do it. If you say something that fictionally is covered by a move, then use that move. If not, it isn't necessary to shoehorn every cough and sneeze into a Move format. Just say that the web burns away rapidly. Done and done, like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350095/#Comment_350095" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T19:28:27+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  7:28PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the 7-9, sounds good for a hard spot, but then I would have immediately looked at the Wizard's player and been like, "FUCKYOU'REONFIREWHATDOYOUDOUWHATDOYOUDOWHATDOYOUDO?!?!?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gyroland" title="gyroland"><img alt="gyroland" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gyroland">gyroland</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350106/#Comment_350106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T22:22:06+00:00" title="November 30, 2011 10:22PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2011 10:31PM by gyroland.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Temple of Ungu might be better known as "A two hour dungeon world demo by Jason Morningstar".
