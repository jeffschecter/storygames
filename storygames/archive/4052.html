I have picked up three keen volunteers to help as facilitators, and we should have a good library of games to run between us.<br/><br/>So I thought I'd just see if any of you people who actually run and play in the original at Gencon could throw me anything useful...  traps for young players, and all that sort of stuff.<br/><br/>For convention context, it's a small but enthusiastic convention (we get about 120 people) over two days, with 3 sessions per day, plus a big LARP on Saturday evening. The con has a long history of people running non-traditional games (story games, homebrew rules sets, their own designs, etc). With all that, I'm expecting (or hoping) that we'll get enough people for one or two games to be running all the time.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on how to make sure this rocks would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90604/#Comment_90604" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T04:09:56+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  4:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fly in Kat Miller?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I talked to them about G.O.D. and Indie Games Explosion. So hopefully there is something helpful there. This <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21802.msg223327" rel="nofollow">dead post</a> from the Forge might also be helpful.

Can you move atleast one table out into the hall where passer bys can see it?  Some people are resistant to entering unknown areas in a con.  If you can move one table out of the room then you can play a fun game in the hall.  Gamers having fun always attract other gamers.<br/><br/>Put a copy of each game you can run on the table so that perspective players can see what you are willing to run.  <br/><br/>Keep a Utility box with Dice, Cards, Poker Chips, Stickies, pens, pencils, tape, markers and paperclips and anything else that a person might need to play one of the games.  <br/><br/>Perhaps bring a Posterboard with Games on Demand on it that explains what you are doing and why.  Make sure teh Convention people are ok with this. <br/><br/>At Gen Con this year there was a little more confusion caused by the "Games on Demand" name.  Several Gamers and a few of the GMs thought they had to run any game a player wanted to "demand."  Next year Games on Demand will be replaced by "Spontanious Indie Gaming Now"  To play, look for the  S.I.G.N.<br/><br/>I think S.I.G.N. speaks more about what we are doing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90629/#Comment_90629" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T07:09:38+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  7:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't put out games that you can't run or don't have a fair bit of experience running.

I'm planning to make a big poster or three and keeping the door open. That should guarantee that anyone who walks past the front desk immediately sees where we are.<br/><br/>Display all games - check; box of useful stuff - check. I'm planning on photocopying out a huge pile of character sheets and other handouts for everything I bring along too.<br/><br/>I've run the idea past the convention committee already and they're pretty supportive, so I don't think there should be any issues there. <br/><br/><br/>Jonathon - Yep, although I'm making a couple of exceptions for games that I really want to play and haven't had a good chance to.<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
