A lot of fun was had by all, which was great.  I got some awesome player reactions to descriptions of scenes, which is always an internal GM goal for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic premise was that kinfolk (normal humans/wolves from whom werewolves can be born) loyal to the Glasswalker's had been killed.  The players were sent to the scene to check out what was going on.  They found some clues leading them to the conclusion that the wererats were behind it.  Some of the pack investigated that, and got into a shouting match with wererats.  The rats said that the wolves had attacked THEIR kin 2 months ago, and that the rats had been preparing a devastating strike to the wolves in Paris.  Because one of the two who investigated was a Bone Gnawer, who are allied with the rats, the rats didn't attack and let the pack know that they had 24 hours to avert this war.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players eventually went back to the scene and were about to start investigating, when fomori police, who had chased them out earlier(looking like normal cops) showed up and a firefight began.  We ended at the end of the fight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd forgotten how deadly werewolf can be!  Two of the fomori were killed instantly by players rolling well enough to hit+ and then doing tons of damage on the damage side of things while the fomori rolled poorly on soak.  I think the fomori that I generated are really paper tigers.  2 players were incapacitated at different points, and at least 1 other was severely wounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did well:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpirits.  Much better than some of the previous spirits I've played, I think the pathetically wasting away loyalty spirit got some sympathy, and the dying hearth spirit got some great reactions when it screamed, "THE RATS ATE THEIR EYES!" and died.<br/>\n<br/>\nRatkin.  I think the rats came off as not entirely bloodthirsty, but definitely antagonistic towards werewolves, and more than happy to pick a fight if numbers and weapons are on their side.  While I think these guys will eventually become allies, I think they will be tenuous allies at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did ok:<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning of the investigation:  I think there were enough clues that the houses should be checked out (many homes with 'fresh paint" and "new carpets!") and the checking out of the house was creepy and disgusting enough to make the players WANT whoever did this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I could have done better:<br/>\n<br/>\nUmbra.  Even though what I've got is already pretty effective, I need to use more than sight and sound.  Taste, touch, and smell could have been utilized more effectively.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlot hole. I assumed that players would do the standard CSI thing of, 'we've hit a dead end, back to the evidence!'  When they didn't, I put in an out of character comment.  I probably should have had the cop car that was pursuing them interact with them more the first time around, clue the players in to the fact that the cops are jumpy, and that there may be more there.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat.  I didn't set the example that I wanted.  :(  The combat can take awhile, but it should be exciting if the description is there.  Lackluster Storyteller descriptions of "He levels the revolver at you and fires twice" make for a boring combat.  Whoops.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
