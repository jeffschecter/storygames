I want my dice to be "right". But I want them to be fair.<br/><br/>I'm not superstitious about a lot of other dice things I often see.<br/><br/>To me, "good dice" are dice that have an equal chance of each side and the concept of a "good roll", though drilled into us since we played roll-and-move board games as a kid, is hard for me to understand. I sometimes see people playing D&amp;D and it's like they attribute some skill to rolling high. I guess I'm missing out on a lot of fun by lacking this particular superstition. The notion that a particular player can be particularly lucky or unlucky <em>when it comes to die rolls</em> is hard for me to grasp, similarly the oft-repeated statement "dice hate me" or the idea that dice have memories and that a crit can be "wasted" on the initative roll. On some level, I get that people say these things just for fun.<br/><br/>If someone is misses a saving throw and falls in a trap I might consider that unlucky though. But I don't necessarily see those dice as haunted or unlucky. It was falling in the trap that was unlucky, not the roll (I don't know why I detach them so). It's weird, I have a lot of "magical thinking" in other areas of life.<br/><br/>What about you? Do you feel skillful when you've rolled a high natural number? Do you have the notion that you're "good" at rolling dice? I kind of fell into this for a while when it came to rolling the d6 for initiative because I had a streak. In the end, we won initiative about half the time anyway. So there probably was no "magic" to the rolls.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441487/#Comment_441487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T15:28:19+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  3:28PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see that a lot, and it's easy to fool people too!<br/>When we're playing a game that involves d6s, and someone is about to roll something crucial, I usually say something like "You know you're going to roll a 2, right?" or "Hey, roll me a four, please."<br/><br/>People remember the times that things coincide more than the times they don't.

Of course dice superstition is still a topic of banter on occasion; my Savonian gaming group used to be particularly fond of equating "dicing skill" with the other skills involved in old school D&amp;D as a jocular barb.<br/><br/>I am pretty big on dice aesthetics, though; I like to select the dice that are used for a given game, and ensure that an uniform array of properly color-coded dice are available for the whole group. I generally don't go far enough to custom-buy appropriate dice for each and every game, but picking selections out of a big parcel of idle dice is common, as is putting away "playsets" for specific games. For my currently in development game I got some blank d6s to customize for the playtests, just to motivate myself.<br/><br/>An idle speculation would have it that dice superstitions and dice aesthetics are basically the same sort of thing, just seen through more or less self-aware worldviews, with higher or lower degrees of personal finickiness and such. Humans are aesthetic critters, we see patterns and ascribe values. Sewing a nice-looking pouch for your dice, preferring a specific color of dice, entertaining patterns of fortune, keeping lucky dice, training your dice... it's all an aesthetic continuum, with full-blown superstition at the other end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441491/#Comment_441491" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T16:00:39+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  4:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read an article about polyhedral dice fairness.

That's not a superstition, that's just liking things that look good. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  I have inherited many dice over the years, resulting in my having quite a collection of less-than-aesthetically-pleasing dice, and they never come out of the bag unless I need them.  Because why use ugly dice? I disagree with Eero here - I prefer dice of "certain colors" because I like those colors, which are generally the same sorts of colors I like in other things too.  I don't think there's any 'continuum' between "These dice are pretty" and "these dice are lucky"  nor have I observed this in anyone else around me.<br/><br/>I've also had some uncanny bad luck with saving throws - to the point where other people at the table notice that I've, say, been dazed since the 2nd round of the fight.  But this is likely just confirmation bias - you remember the time you botched a save against an effect 5 rounds in a row, but not the five times when you saved against random stuff on the first try.<br/><br/>I don't really have any "dice superstitions" myself though - okay, fine, sometimes I'll breathe on the dice before rolling them.  Not that I precisely think this will help, but it can't hurt, right?  And maybe it disrupts any "pattern" I have in my throw.  <br/><br/>Certainly, I don't feel "skillful" when I roll well, but I do feel "lucky" and those are not the same thing.  Even people in my circles who "feel" like they roll disproportionately well don't think of it as any sort of 'skill'.<br/><br/>That said, you can TOTALLY "waste" a roll.  :P  If one assumes that in a parallel universe, you decided NOT to make that perception check that revealed nothing on a 20, that 20 would -clearly- have shown up on your ACTUAL next die roll, which might actually have been useful.  Again though, I don't really view this as a "superstition" so much as just "Dang, I wish I had rolled that on something that matters."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441503/#Comment_441503" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T21:48:06+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  9:48PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... well, at the risk of being labelled "selfish", I do not share my Primary Dice, of which I have sufficient for my needs without casting about, delaying play to assemble a pool. EX: If my highest possible pool in Hero is 15, I have 15d6 exactly. For some games, I even mix colors to match frequently-occurring pool counts; so, frex, if I know that I have one ability that rolls 5, another that rolls 7, and a third that rolls 9, I'll have 5 of one color, 2 of another color, and 2 of a third color--again, to easily grab what I need without increasing what is already-long handling time.<br/><br/>For demoing, con GMing, and hosting a game no one else owns (more than I like!), I'll have separate sets of dice for everyone--again, no sharing because sharing is slowing!<br/><br/>For DitV... hell, I just open my dice organizer and sigh. And for Mechaton--err, MF0--I have five bricks in the game's colors, plus 4d8 in green and red; and yes, I share them. No helping THAT mayhem.<br/><br/>However... NO ONE, but NO ONE, used my black-on-yellows or my black-on-clear Borealis dice! That's a hanging offense.

Preferring nice-looking dice (which may match, or contrast in a cool way, or whatever) is not, to me, part of a continuum with dice superstition.<br/><br/>Given the choice of any one pack of dice at a game store, I would pick the set which looks the nicest and has the most even random spread (of course, there's usually no way to know that without testing the dice, so just generally style/look is all you can go on). I'd prefer dice made of a solid, interesting material to dice made out of cheap plastic. And so on.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean I expect those dice to roll a BETTER result (i.e. more favourable to me)! That's a whole different question.<br/><br/>I just want my dice to be fair. (Although I don't REALLY care - I'll still have fun playing if my dice are "unlucky".)<br/><br/>Likewise, I don't want my grubby friend Jane to handle my dice, because I know her dog was just licking her hands, and I saw her dog eating raccoon droppings just a few minutes ago before we came in. But, again, that's not dice superstition - if Jane <i>were</i> to handle my dice, I'd be a little annoyed that they might now smell like raccoon poop, but I certainly don't expect them to roll any differently.<br/><br/>However, the psychology of the gamble is an interesting thing. Every human being internalizes a belief (or sometimes just a hope) that THEY are SPECIAL. I'm not like everyman or everywoman: I am a PC, not an NPC. There are special things in store for me, and I hope to discover what they are. I secretly hope that, in some way, I am simply *better* than most other people. At least in some small way.<br/><br/>I think that dealing with randomness provides people with some kind of reassurance in this respect. A person enters the lottery not because they think they have a good chance of winning (I think most people are aware that lottery odds are ultimately against them), but because they want to see some kind of evidence for their special nature.<br/><br/>I am meant for great things, and may be <i>this time</i> the universe will come through and show me that these feelings of greatness aren't in vain...<br/><br/>So, when I roll a 20 in the climactic battle and slay the Beast of Arrrgh, I feel a huge sense of pride. I did it! Because I'm special. See, the universe acknowledges me and my specialness. Specialhood.

That wasn't quite what I meant when I was talking about superstition above (what I meant was a belief in forces beyond our ken and beyond our control robbing us of agency), but in any case I disagree with your thesis that apophenia has been a useful tool. I'm open to persuasion, but I currently think the exact opposite is true, i.e. that seeking to deny chaos (which is what apophenia amounts to) is actually <i>unhelpful</i>, because if we don't understand and recognise chaos, then we can't ward ourselves against it.

I'll also help myself to a drink if you bring a bottle to the table, and assume as a matter of course that you'll help with the dishes after dinner. It all signals my trust in your honor and friendship, and my willingness and intent to treat you as a friend towards whom I'm comfortable to be beholden, so you should take it as a compliment. If I don't feel comfortable just grabbing your dice, perhaps that's a sign that I feel hostile towards you, or I fear that you don't like me and am acting overly formal <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Odds are that I could well miss the significant looks entirely if somebody was annoyed by my overly familiar habits; partly this would be because I'd want to save them the embarrassment of overtly noticing them acting petty. If somebody made a point of going as far as to say something about it, I'd desist from borrowing their dice in the future, of course (although I might joke about their weird taboo now and then). I only remember having run into this in the real life with Jim Raggi (an American, incidentally), though - of course if this was more than once-in-a-lifetime thing, I'd no doubt be more careful about assuming that people are OK with my borrowing their dice.<br/><br/>This is probably not so much a dice superstition issue as it is a social manners thing, I imagine. To me the hesitancy to loan dice looks like maybe a weird hygiene issue of some sort, combined with possessiveness (of the childish "won't loan out my toys" sort). On the other hand, being generous and partaking of generosity signals trust and honor, which is why making a big deal about somebody using your dice can seem petty or even hostile - not much point to it unless you want to offend, are excessively afraid of germs or are a bit childish and unsocialized.<br/><br/>Again, the above explanation is intended to illustrate what this whole social construct looks like to me as a Finnish (and pretty rural at that) gamer. I do not actually imagine that e.g. Americans for whom this dice taboo seems common are routinely hostile, childish or excessively germ-shy. No doubt borrowing dice without prior arrangements looks rude and presumptuous for somebody with different everyday manners. A sociologist might speculate about Nordic child-care culture here as well, I read somewhere that children are apparently taught to be generous with their toys from an early age around here <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Aside from different social manners between regions, I imagine that the gaming background affects dice etiquette as well. I sometimes get the sense that urban gamers who've acclimatized to an active and dynamic gaming scene think of dice not so much as a supply detail as a personal equipment thing - so bringing your own dice to the game signals how hardcore you are. Like, the key issue is not whether the GM brought enough dice for everybody, it's whether you have a personal dice set that's sufficiently cool and expressive of your own personality. As one might imagine, I did my first decade of roleplaying in an environment where it was exceptionally uncommon for anybody to bring their own dice to a game - the GM would obviously take care of bringing the equipment, and how would you know which dice to bring anyway. D&amp;D being a non-entity in the gaming scene of my youth no doubt strengthened this tendency as well, as without a single clearly dominant game in the scene there's also nothing resembling a "standard dice set" that you'd take with you to game night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441846/#Comment_441846" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T22:57:16+00:00" title="January 21, 2015 10:57PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2015 10:58PM by AsIf.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very few of my players have ever brought dice to the game.

Especially as DM now that I have color-coded d20s so I can roll a whole bunch to resolve a lot of things at once.<br/><br/>To me the analogy is having a paper and pencil in front of you, being ready to write something if it comes up, and someone grabs it. Yeah, that analogy is too perfect because people who accept the one will probably see no problem with the latter either.<br/>To me, it's less the "Hey, you can't write with my pencil or roll my dice" and more the milder "Whoah, I was using those" annoyance. Usually after a few seconds I realize that it's fine.<br/>I mean, do I think those dice / that pencil is "sacred" somehow? Yeah, but that shouldn't be a hindrance for someone else to use it.<br/><br/>Hmm, what's another analogy... it's like someone taking a pair of mittens from off your hands and onto theirs.

The more regular dicing is in a game, and the more expectation there is, indeed, for everybody to have "their" dice at the table, the less sense it makes to confuse an arrangement by passing dice around; at worst you'll be taking dice that the other guy needs so they can roll simultaneously with you. I usually don't grab a dying man's only dice when I know that they'll need those a minute after I do because we're in the middle of a combat - rather, I reach for the biggest pile at hand's reach.<br/><br/>Most games I've played, though, even the dicing-intensive types of D&amp;D, tend to take a while to get up to dicing, and when it happens it's unexpected and the need is time-curtailed, often focused on a single player at a time. I'm far from the only person I know who'll routinely come to a game without my own dice because I know the GM will have enough dice for everybody anyway, and then ends up borrowing dice from the person next to me instead of going to the GM's stash, because it's like two hours into the game when I first need some, and I'll only need to make this one roll anyway, no need to make a big production about picking out a personal set when there are idle dice right here. I've been known to just let somebody else roll for me if they have dice in front of them and I don't.<br/><br/>So yeah, improvised dicing relations. I'm only less care-free when I'm GMing (which is, all said and done, more of the time than when I'm not), which is when my role turns up-side down and I'm the one making sure there are enough dice of the appropriate types available. While it's common for the more hardcore players to bring their own dice, I still come to a e.g. D&amp;D table with like a score of two of d20s and whatnot to make sure that should the session devolve into a dicing-heavy long combat, there's enough dice present for everybody to have some when they need them.<br/><br/>Also, dice pool games: it is overwhelmingly the most practical arrangement for any sort of dice-counting game for the GM to bring a big pile of uniform dice (d6s, d10s, whatever the system uses). In those kinds of situations it is a matter of course for everybody to use the same dice as needed. Like say Sorcerer, it'd just be cumbersome for everybody to have their own little dice stall instead of a communal pile.<br/><br/>But of course all this has increasingly little to do with dicing superstition per se, once we get past "I don't want you to despoil the conditioning of my dice" and such. I do acknowledge that there are practical reasons to hold onto personal dice that have nothing to do with developing mystical relationships with your dice, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441871/#Comment_441871" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T14:00:46+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  2:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2015 2:01PM by catty_big.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Eero, I would venture to guess that *most* Americans would react to you grabbing their dice the same way Jim did.

When someone uses my dice, food, house without asking, I feel honored. It signals trust in the longterm reciprocity of the relationship. My gaming group regularly meets at my house when I'm not there, and it's a great compliment to arrive home to a game in progress, knowing that they put that trust in my hospitality.<br/><br/>I also observed that dice possessiveness can be jarring for new role-players to encounter, since, in the context of most other games, dice are a shared resource.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm an Oregonian Mennonite, as far as the cultural background of my manners.<br/><br/>In response to the broader question, I'm pretty put off by dice fetishism in general. To me it signals that the fetishist's identity is invested in the activity in a way that will make honest discussion difficult. I'm probably usually wrong about this, but that's my gut-level anxiety when I notice people fussing over their dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441925/#Comment_441925" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T01:25:30+00:00" title="January 23, 2015  1:25AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just use dice to generate random numbers.
