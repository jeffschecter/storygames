                    I know there is a forum for that, but I like coming here and seeing what Y'all are doing.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking I will try the 10 one hour as a game to play at lunch really thinking more about the 15 minute soap operas they have on the urban radio station here. something that wouldnt take the whole hour and get through an arc in two weeks of lunches.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will start with a Dogs/PTA mashup and hurt the rules from there.<br/>
<br/>
I think it will be about witches 'cuz I have been so resistant to using magic in a game and have been thinking about it alot.<br/>
<br/>
How about you?<br/>

                            I have a few ideas, actually.  Either a time travel game (using the 2s/6h +14 choice), where the players have a 'typical' time-travel action-adventure on the first session, then at the end of the first session they come back to find the future all screwed up.  Cue cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Two weeks later, they have a second session where they go back to try and figure out what went wrong, and try to reconstruct the first session using only their notes and consensus.  The trick is that one of them is a traitor, and who it is isn't apparent even to the players themselves, because the betrayal happens *after* the 'second' mission.  I'm trying to figure out how it's going to work, using 'consensus points' - basically, if your version of things rules the day, you score points.  The traitor is the person with the most (least?) points at the end of the second mission.<br/><br/>A slightly less ambitious idea deals with the 3s/3h ingredient.  Called 'The Ages of Man'.  You play three characters in the same family in three different time periods.  One hour each as children, adults and oldsters.  Based on the famous riddle in Oedipus.<br/><br/>There's something with seasons/years at college with the 4s/2h one, and a Tarot-based game with 10s/1h, with one Major Arcana ruling over each 1/2 hour of play.<br/><br/>That's what I have so far.                        </div>

                            I got an idea from the time constraint but nothing at all from the ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
Four astronauts in the cockpit during the countdown from 10-1 and blast-off.  Every second of the countdown is a scene (or series of scenes) in another astronaut's life and the resolution of that scene (or those scenes) feeds into the success pools of the take-off and the mission, rolled at the end.<br/>
<br/>
The crew is made collaborative but there ain't much on their character sheet.  It is like, -Why they want to go to space- and -Why they want to come back to earth- and -What they want from life when they retire- maybe.  But I could see it looking a whole lot like the Polaris sheet too:  Space, Earth, The Moon, The Sun or some-such.<br/>
<br/>
Scene framing is round robin with each player taking an astronaut while the other players perhaps take up rolls in the Space, Earth, Moon and Sun to play out the scene.  Maybe Control rather than Sun.<br/>
<br/>
Each scene takes up an hour.  Ten scenes.<br/>
<br/>
1st Quest.  Dictionary of Mu. d20 Project.  Graduate School.  I have no time for this, no time to write it and I'm not sure if I really do or if I'm just ramming an idea into the 10 one hour sessions thing.  And since I have nothing from the ingredients themselves, it wouldn't be a part of the game chef competition anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But I'll keep it in the backburner, gamer notebook in my brain.                        </div>

<blockquote>I'm just gonna take this week to rewrite Snow From Korea. These ingredients leave my head totally blank.</blockquote>
The trick with these (and I agree that they're a tough mix, both of them) - is to use the terms much more broadly.  I think that the first batch is easier than the second.  Particularly, I'm taking liberties with 'law' and 'actor'.<br/><br/>Judd - I really like your idea - I was thinking of something similar for the 10s/1hr mix.  I twirled it together with my current thought-train of West Wing, and was going to make it the last ten seconds before the 'Committee to End Suffering', appointed by the president himself, finished a ritual to call up the Ancient Horrors in the Oval Office.  Starting from that very weird point, we have a series of flashbacks to how all of this got started in the first place.  The GM(?) is the President, and at the end of the whole thing, the Committee members (who are all conflicted about the idea, BTW) cast their votes to see if the President resists or succumbs to the evil and the whole world lives or dies.<br/><br/>There was also a sort of play on Executive Decision, where it's the last ten seconds before he turns the key to launch a nuclear strike.  The play of the campaign (plus voting again) decides whether he does or not.  At the end of each session, you move the Doomsday Clock hands forward or back.  At the end, you have to get enough votes to turn the hands back.  So if the play of the game puts the hands at 5 *after* midnight, you have to crank it all the way back to 1 minute before.  So if play has gone all against peace, the vote can't erase everything in an instant.                        </div>

Thanks, Andy.  I'm not sure at all if it's going to work.  It may take me until Wednesday just to figure it out.  :^)  Kinda cutting it close.  I'm going to chew on it this weekend.  If I don't have a significant breakthrough, I'm going to ditch it for one of the others.                        </div>

                            After a few hours of having no ideas at all, I'm now in a situation where I have too many ideas to make. Most of them are just vague ideas that will quickly fall by the wayside. But the two ideas I'm most likely to actually write and submit both seem to be of equal worth and interest to me. So i'm looking for feedback on the two ideas, to see what people think of each. <br/>
<br/>
The first idea is a game using the 4 sessions of 2 hours rule, with Committee, Emotion and something else (not sure which yet). You play a trial sequence, wherein one player is the Accused, one the Victim, one representing the Committee that judges, and one a Witness to the crime. It is clear from the start that the Accused committed the crime he is acused of, but the Committee needs to determine his motives for doing so. So each participant tells his or her version of the crime over the course of a session (Committee going last, as a judgement of what happened). Each version will be similar in broad strokes, but different in details and, importantly, in the motives of the participants. At this point, I'm thinking of some card based mechanic wherein each suit is a particular emotion or motive, and in conflicts you play cards and narrate why you're doing things as well as how. Each session the Trump suit changes, too, so you are portraying your character with different motives than before. (Think Rashomon or Hero, or courtroom dramas.) <br/>
<br/>
The other idea uses the ten sessions of one hour apiece. One player takes the role of the Actor, who is in a precarious osition that will end very badly for him within an hour and is trying to avoid that fate. The other players are playing NPCs and impartial forces trying to push the Actor toward a given ending, most of which are bad. Each session these roles rotate around, so probably everyone gets to be the Actor. Each session also plays out over the same span of time: the Actor reaches the same crisis, then tries to avoid in in some novel way, and the other oppose this in various ways. So onceagain you have multiple different versions of events, though in this case they're more like alternate realities than alternate viewpoints. I've got the start of a system whereby the hour time limit affects the difficulty of the Actor's actions, whereas the session number increases the other player's actions.(Think Run Lola Run.)                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
My idea is to do a game based off of Sherlock Holmes.  It won't be about actually exploring what it was like to be Holmes or what Doyle's London was like.  But it uses motiffs and actual elements from the stories to create a setting and system for the players to make thier own.  Think of it as a cross between InSpectres and Sherlock Holmes with a bit more danger and grit.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I'm too busy to enter, in any case, but I have some musings. It's all peanut gallery stuff, so take it with a grain of salt. <br/><br/>I really like the time theme, and I'm pretty happy with either of the two ingredient sets, actually. At the same time, I think there may be too many choices to make, with the unexpected consequence of closing off rather than opening up design options. <br/><br/>Here's what I mean by that -- I think the theme and the ingredients may be in competition. (I thought this last year as well, for what it's worth.) So the theme may give you a great idea (or two or three), and then you want to run with it, but then you have to consider the ingredients -- and this would be an issue regardless of what the specific ingredient sets are. So you can't focus your efforts on nailing the theme as much as you could with wide open ingredients. <br/><br/>On the other side, with the "here are four ingredients, choose three, go do anything with them" set up (ie with no theme), even though you have a very tight ingredient limitation, you can focus on it immediately. You go straight at doing cool things with your ingredients. <br/><br/>Basically, you'd be working within just one constraint set rather than within two distinct sets of constraints. So with either themes or ingredients, you have limitations in one area, but things are wide open in everything else. But when you combine both ingredients and a rules theme, each set of constraints (and each set of inspirations, because the constraints are all inspirations as well of course) competes with the other for your design attention. You end up with divided priorities. <br/><br/>I think that would have been the speed bump for my design process. But again, I'm too busy to seriously consider taking part this year (and I was last year as well), <i>and</i> I'm being cowardly and dodging even helping with judging, so I'm in an easy position to make loud noises of no particular consequence. I still think the competition looks cool this year, and I still wish I had time to join in. <br/><br/>If I were making a game? I'd probably go with ancient, committee, and emotion. It'd be probably be 1 two hour session. And it'd be pretty meta -- you'd go into it playing those wizards and demons and elves and whatever at the ancient committee meeting to put another dungeon down in the world somewhere, and of course you know how committees go when people get their little pet projects and pet peeves, and get too emotional. And you'd end the two hour session with an actual, playable dungeon to go into with your D&amp;D group. (The core books of your favorite version of D&amp;D would be required, and everything would have to be by the book, just pull it out and put it in rather than creating new stuff, due to the time limitation.) <br/><br/>Something like that. It wouldn't just be a brainstorming session, of course -- it'd have to be a game, all its own, and an RPG proper. The characters would probably be pre-gens, and the pet peeves and pet projects would be among their relevant traits... hm. I haven't thought it out in any real detail because I know it ain't gonna happen with my current schedule. <br/><br/>Rich                        </div>

                            I may have cracked the magic thing! If you imagine the wheel of stats in Dogs as a four humors set up then all of the actions are controlled by the elements which join those humors.  ( I will post a graphic representation when I do the real rules).<br/>
<br/>
Everything works off those four humors for normal characters but when you become a mage there is a fifth thing added which I am calling Havok which transforms the circle into a good old pentagram and changing the relationship of all your humors.<br/>
<br/>
I'v even been toying with a version with the Kabalah where the four humors are changed to be two triangles (think star of David) where the old rules of what a character can do don't apply<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to make it work with one die in ten one hour chunks. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you will the screen time mechanism from PTA.  Add the rules from En Guard that put characters in situations which make them fight. (thinky thinky). There was an article on Bankuei's Deep in the game about flag framing that I am taking to heart so I need a mechanism for the players to tell the GM what sort of conflicts will make cool stories and do it fast.<br/>
<br/>
Not using multiple dice is going to change the pacing mechanisms for conflict resolution.  I have been fond of a single die mechanism that goes <br/>
1= the worst possible outcome<br/>
6= the best possible outcome<br/>
and the rest are determined by the difficulty of the task. <br/>
If the task is routine 2 is a basic failure and 3-5 is a  succese.<br/>
If the task is challenging 2-3 2 is a basic failure and 4-5 is a  succese.<br/>
If the task is Difficult 2-4 is a basic failure and 5 is a  succese.<br/>
to keep the pacing right  I will use some sort of  Conflict points ( Action Points)  the big part at the start of any conflict is going to be determining how many action points you have.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be all brand namey about the thefting of my ideas. At best I only ever have two weeks of attention for any thing so I need to get a long way in as fast as I can. I have been putting these parts together in different ways for about five years and this new set of tools I have gotten from the story games has changed everything. Thank you.                        </div>

                            Pirates!!! Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Here's mine.  I'm up too late and need to think on this.  Gotta decide because I only have Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning before I head off to Mexico for a week.<br/>
<br/>
One -  Book of Job<br/>
<br/>
1 - 2 hour session<br/>
*4 players:  1 takes the role of the devil, 3 form a [i]committee[/i] to play Job's mind, <br/>
body, and spirit.*The story of the Book of Job is [i]ancient[/i].  It's around 3000 years old in written form and probably much older than that in an oral tradition.<br/>
*Play centers around the players being tormented by the Devil and having an [i]emotional[/i] imbalance between the three aspects of the character Job.<br/>
<br/>
Players address the emotional imbalance through creative story telling of passive resistance to the Devil's tormenting.  They gain dice to try and score [i]piety[/i], which eventually determines if Job passes the test, gets to meet with God.  The players can also give in to [i]temptations[/i] to help them restore emotional balance.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is going to be something else involved also (maybe a desire of each aspect of <br/>
Job that is fulfilled by giving into temptation), but the game will overall be one of cooperating instead of competition.  But, there may be some type of competition involving the temptations.  Or, at least, player wrist slapping.<br/>
<br/>
Two - Threat Level Red (I think this needs a different name)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* 1 - 2 Hour Session<br/>
* law, steel, team<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Situation: A terror organization has invaded an overseas military base in a country that is occupied by the army, secured a nuke, and has taken hostages.  The military base is the home base of an elite anti-terror squad and the hostages are loved ones.  The nuke can be prevented from exploding or the hostages can be saved.  Period.  If the nuke goes off a city in the country they are based in will be destoryed.  No other citizens of the player's country will die in the explosion.<br/>
<br/>
The players take on the roles of members of the anti-terror squad, who have to restore [i]law[/i] and order on the base.  One player plays the Game Moderator.<br/>
<br/>
A timer is set at the start of the game before character creation or any play starts and even before the rules are explained.  The players have exactly two hours before the bomb goes boom.<br/>
<br/>
The characters have resources represented by [i]Steel[/i] Points, which can be lost after they are used.  When acting as a [i]team[/i], it is harder to lose steel points, but it also makes the mission harder.  When acting alone, the mission is easier, but steel goes quicker. There will be some kind of mission track pacing mechanic.  Players continue until two hours are up and the nuke explodes or until they disarm the nuke or rescue their loved ones. This will have a cinematic fight system and lots of mooks to kill off.                        </div>

<blockquote>Hey Andy, I've never asked - how exactly DO you pick your ingredient lists?</blockquote>
I do a line of coke off a stripper's tits while watching "Bad Lieutenant", and pick out the first word I hear.<br/><br/>OK, actually, I open up www.cnn.com, and go to one of the sub-pages (technology, science, economics).  From there, I click on a random article, then glance at it for the first noticable word I can find that is a noun, adjective or the like that seems usable.  I tend to be nice, and skip over words like:<br/><br/>penniless<br/>depth charge<br/>consideration<br/>Thursday<br/>49 percent<br/><br/>That's seriously how I do it. I inherited this method from the Big Man, himself, Mike Holmes. I have a little shrine for him right here.<br/><br/>speaking of which, I haven't seen much of Mike lately. I think he recently got promoted at his work or something, and thus real responibilities kicked in. :-(<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I stayed awake until like 4AM or so, and only saw a few nascent ideas roll around, but for the most part it was "I like the rules!" "I don't like the rules!" "Thanks!" "Wow!" etc from the Usual Suspects who always participate in Game Chef.<br/><br/>I got a little nervous and went to bed.<br/><br/>Went I woke up the next day (mid morning-afternoon), and checked 1km1kt, literally the first page had <i>scrolled</i> because of all the submitted potential entries.  <br/><br/>Ca-razy.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<br/>
Kingdoms of Glass - "In the cycle of time, ages come and ages go.  The end of the current age approaches and your civilization faces destruction."<br/>
<br/>
The players play two roles, members of the Commitee of Ancients who interpret the prophecies to set the quests and who call out the heroes to face them; and the heroes themselves.<br/>
<br/>
WIth each session, the fear of the population builds, represented by dark stones stored in a glass container and the heroes attempt to build hope in the populace by completing the quests before them and adding light stones to the container.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the fourth session, the battle which closes the age occurs, with the heroes taking advantage from the light stones and the impending threat taking advantage from the dark.  The result of this final roll shapes the next age.                        </div>

                            That sounds very cool, Blue. I like the epic Tolkien-esque feel.<br/><br/>My own entry is shaping up to be a gamist romp inspired by the pulps. As members of the Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries and the Enlightenment of Mankind, each character is a pulp hero of the highest order. They have gone on an expedition to explore a lost civilization and bring back its ancient relics. Now they sit with the rest of the Committee members in the great meeting hall sipping festive beverages and trying to gain the most acclaim for their contribution to the expedition by recounting the hazards they faced and the stylish way they overcame them.<br/><br/>It's my first attempt at creating a gamist system, and so far it's been really fun.                        </div>

                            Blue, that sounds very similar to the idea I'm working on. I haven't announced it anywhere, but I'll do so now, if anybody is interested.<br/>
<br/>
The Ancient Greek World, during the Age of Gods and Men: Zeus, father of all the Gods has decided that he wants a new religious festival for the Mortals to honor him. He has declared that it will be known as the "Olympics" and shall be held in four years time in the most worthy City-State in all of the Greek World - anywhere from Iberia to the Black Sea.<br/>
<br/>
But there are more city-states than Zeus can be bothered to remember, so to discover which is most worthy, he has chosen a number of his Godly offspring to do it for him. They will be known as the "Mt. Olympus Committee", and will report back in four mortal years, or Zeus shall rip all of Creation asunder.<br/>
<br/>
Now, each of these Gods has a particular city-state where they are worshipped more than the others, and they want "their" city-state, and by extension, them to receive Zeus' favor. So, to come to an agreement, the Gods each summon a Hero to champion their city-state, and then the champion who completes the most heroic tasks shall win the right for his city-state to host the Olympics.<br/>
<br/>
But Gods cannot stop themselves from meddling in Mortal affairs, and the Committee is no different. They bicker, bribe, lend favors, call in favors and persuade the others to set ever greater challenges in the way of the other champions whilst doing the same to grant Boons to aid their own champion. The city-state to receive the games will have less to do with the exploits of champions in the mortal world, and more to do with the deals happening at Mount Olympus.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient/Committee/Emotion and 4x2hrs, with one session covering one year. Each hero has a number of emotional 'flags' which form the basis of the Situation creation system, but I'm struggling with that part at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also pondering my conflict resolution system. I can either have a quick, basic "roll a number of d6. The side with the highest total wins" version, which could be a bit bland and uninteresting, or a more complex Dogs-like "roll a pool of various die types, and attack and counterattack with those dice" idea that I really like. Hmmm.                        </div>

                            Lxndr - there definitely should be a game inspired by "Heroes Die."<br/>
<br/>
This is a terrible week for me, but an idea HAS grabbed me.  "The Death of Socrates."  High-brow philosophizing amidst mob psychology and the cult of personality.  3 3-hour sessions - Prosecution, Defense, and Sentencing.<br/>
<br/>
And it's called "The Death of Socrates," not "The Trial of Socrates."   Because at the end, he dies, no matter what else happens in the game.<br/>

<br/>
How many words is a typical entry for Game Chef?  Or perhaps I should ask about a typical winning entry?<br/>
<br/>
I know the right answer is as many as it takes, but I'm a numbers guy and am looking for some sort of gauge to suggest that I've missed some key component because I am running short of words.                        </div>

                            Back from a vacation. I worked on and thought about my game a lot (mostly thought). It's still a bit on the unfinished side, but the idea right now is 'The Right Hand of Mr. Big', a competitive game between two teams of master spies whose job it is to defend or recover The Object. I forgot my dice at home, and the only randomizer I had on hand was a Scrabble set, so I incorporated the letter/scores into the mechanic. It will either be screamingly cool or a pile of unrelated little things wiggling at one another. Either way, it's been a lot of fun.<br/>

                            Cool, Remi!  <br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing it.  Welcome back.  Glad you didn't get turned into a harem slave and taken to Gatlinburg.  <br/><br/><em>Or did you?</em> </div>

                            I'm making a game that started off with Law, Actor and Team as well.  After some thought, though, the Law link was tenuous, so instead it became Actor, Team and Steel.  My Actor ingredient is totally falling in the category of "too F*cking Obvious" though. :-) <br/><br/>Remember the experiment that we did with Remi, Jason me and Mark the other day at Troublecon?  It's like that game, but I took out most of the <i>suck</i>, and even added in some resource management.<br/><br/>Hopefully I'll be done by submission time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I'm so close to finishing I just may pee myself.  The problem is that I have to get it finished in the 8 hours that I'm at work tonight - that's all the guaranteed time I have left.<br/><br/>It's going to be close.                        </div>

                            Good luck, Andy! Doing that game as a full-blown RPG is one of my big goals down the road. I just want to get a couple smaller designs under my belt before I tackle it.                        </div>
