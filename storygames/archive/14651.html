They're content to let you live, provided you don't interfere with them.<br/><br/>What would make you leave to investigate? Either give me specific hooks or broad instances.

The disease could in itself be something that is either really hard to cure and will make everyone really sick but then get better, or is really easy to cure if caught early enough, but if not will make everyone really sick and die gruesomely.  One of the characters has some medical training, but needs some diagnostic equipment or old medical book they have in the next town over, so he can tell which disease it is.  But the next town needs a frammistat for their well; their hand-cranked pump might go any day now.  Another one of the characters may have some blacksmith/mechanical/machinist training and can make one, but he's getting sicker.  The next town has some old equipment he can make it on, which we don't have.  Maybe our pump is also failing; can he make whatever parts we need as well?  Are we sure he's going to survive long enough?  <br/><br/>The disease could be what's hitting the crops or the livestock.  The return of the Grain Blight?  Maybe the livestock were bred from what few survived the Plague Wars (due to engineered immunity) but the Plague itself may have mutated.  Veterinary training, medical equipment or book, next town, yadda yadda.  Plus when the crops or livestock die, that's it for the food supply.  <br/><br/>We don't have a lot of pregnancies in our town, but the past year we've had three blessed events.  Now three tragedies.  A month or so before they were each due, the mothers all took fever, all of their glands swelled up like unto watermelons, and we all thought they were going to die.  They lived, but the babies didn't.  Next town, medical equipment or book, yadda yadda.  We've got two more blessed events...<br/><br/>Potential other problem: there's a history between this town and the next town, or the head of this little hardscrabble group and the head of the next one.  Both are too pigheaded to see that if they don't get over it and work together, maybe neither of the little hardscrabble groups will make it through the winter.  <br/><br/>Whatever the problem is, the solution is a Macguffin in Hitchcock's sense.  Does it much matter except for color?  There Is A Problem.  You don't have the means to solve it here and now.  The next town over, or the old university in the bombed out city, or some old hermit three days' ride away, might be able to help.  The longer you take, though, the worse it gets.  <br/><br/>I have a feeling whatever game or system you're using may have some bearing on it.  Apocalypse World vs. Gamma World, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333418/#Comment_333418" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T19:10:16+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  7:10PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno Bill, why do you think the monsters have disappeared?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333425/#Comment_333425" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T20:44:56+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  8:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.
