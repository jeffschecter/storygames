I'm modifying quite a few things to make it into more of an explosive one-shot type of game (more built-in situation, more Keys that might set characters at odds with one another, stuff like that).<br/><br/>But one thing I keep wondering about:<br/><br/>What should I do about refreshment scenes? My feeling is that with a short time slot, five players who are new to everything in the game, and no "continuing" play, they might be either unnecessary or too vague (yet another rule to worry about "doing right", without a long period of play for us as a group to figure out what they're for, as I think would happen in a regular Lady Blackbird game). <br/><br/>My own thoughts so far:<br/><br/>1. Scrap them altogether. Just play out the session with the starting Pools. This might mean more people might take dice instead of XP from their Keys, which means less advancement, but that's not all that terrible. Since it's a one-shot, accumulating Conditions and reducing Pools as we play out might not be a bad thing.<br/><br/>2. Make slightly more specific guidelines for refreshment, and something that will still move play forward quickly in the context of a one-shot. Something like this:<br/><br/>"When you make yourself vulnerable to someone, by entrusting them with something you hold dear (a valuable secret, your life, your heart, your honour), refresh your Pool up to seven dice."<br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279643/#Comment_279643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T06:56:30+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  6:56AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2010 6:59AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently played a Blackbird hack with five players as a one-shot.

Then, once you grok how the mechanics work (which happens quickly, because the mechanics are elegant and simple), you realize that you just BLEW ALL YOUR DICE ON SOME BULLSHIT. So you start key-grubbing to get some more. Which makes the game more fun for everyone. Hurrah!<br/><br/>I guess cautious player might end up maxing their pools, and thus not engaging with the reward cycle. But I think that becomes really obvious to the player in that situation. Like "Hey, you just saw how easy it is to get new dice, so do some crazy stuff and spend the ones you've got. Go!"<br/><br/>Oh, also, having a large enough pile of dice so that every player can have their own pile in front of them is good, as we all probably know. If you can immediately SEE how everyone's pile o' dice is behaving, you'll understand the cycle better, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279703/#Comment_279703" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T12:13:38+00:00" title="July  8, 2010 12:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I ran Bloody Forks of the Ohio (another of Jason's Blackbird hacks) as a one-shot, it seemed like everyone saved their dice for the big attack on Fort Duquesne at the end.

It also kept the story rolling and kept more players involved, which was a plus. That might be a good thing for players in a one-shot. (The second session saw the players starting to do a bit more of the personality searching suggested in the examples in the rules.)<br/><br/>Of course, I like the idea of one-shot players just treating Keys as a refreshment engine, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280747/#Comment_280747" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T19:02:08+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  7:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My latest thought:<br/><br/>Forget refreshment scenes.
