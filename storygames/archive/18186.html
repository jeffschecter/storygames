I was Xi\xe0 the Undefeated, elf barbarian, hailing from the great empire to the east. She had tormented eyes, a supple body, unusual jewelry from a dozen cultures she had raided, and clothing of rough silks dyed with nothing fancier than the blood of her enemies.<br/><br/>I like the choice between <i>full plate and packing steel</i> and <i>unencumbered, unharmed.</i> I explain it to new players as, \u201cYou can play either as Conan, or as pictures of Conan.\u201d I chose the former because chain mail looks badass and is superior to no armor. It was really the only choice for the serious conquering warlord.<br/><br/>For <i>Herculean appetites,</i> I chose \u201cconquest\u201d and asked the GM to choose the other option, which was \u201cpure destruction.\u201d Now, I love this move to death, not least of all because I think the Ghoul is one of the best-written playbooks in <i>Monsterhearts;</i> but determining when I got to pick up that d8 was a little dicey (pun intended). For example, I can imagine some situations which are explicitly impure destruction: maybe if you\u2019re destroying something to accomplish some further end, like defending your child, or knocking over a building so you can build a new one in its place. But what exactly is pure destruction? Is it collateral damage? Damage you go out of your way to create? Or does any attempt to destroy someone\u2019s face count? I can see similar problems coming up with some other appetites\u2014like, isn\u2019t every move in a dungeon in pursuit of riches?<br/><br/><i>The upper hand</i> didn\u2019t come up.<br/><br/><i>Musclebound</i> was useful, though I forgot I had it for most of the game. Next time I might want to write it in, in parentheses, on the gear list so that I remember.<br/><br/><i>What are you waiting for?</i> is awesome! I love how it makes heedlessly calling out your enemies tactically useful to your adventuring party, since I love shouting challenges in-character.<br/><br/>Regarding gear: I never like to use a sword (either in real life or in role-playing games) if alternatives are available, especially for classes like barbarians or rangers who might feel more comfortable with a weapon that resembles a tool (instead of swords, which are useful for exactly one thing). So even though the great sword was the optimal choice for a one-session game in which finding a shield wasn\u2019t likely, I fought with axe and dagger. The combination was really fun in terms of movement and theatrics, as Xi\xe0 would do stuff like slam the dagger into an enemy so she could climb up it and put her axe-blade through its face. But I wish I could have had some missiles as well, maybe some javelins or (for a character from another culture) boomerangs.<br/><br/>My token from my homeland was a copy of Confucius\u2019s <i>Analects</i> written on rolled-up bamboo strips. There was one scene where our characters were blinded and she indicated her position to her comrades by loudly reciting her favorite Confucius quotes. \u2026 which brings me to my favorite part of the barbarian, the fact that I was able to play against type and flavor my character as an extremely proper, civilized, and conquest-hungry Northern Chinese noblewoman, somewhat inspired by Xi\xe0ng Y\u01d4. She was still an outsider, but she never stopped telling the rest of the party how uncouth and uncivilized they were.<br/><br/>While I didn't like many things about this particular session\u2014mostly quibbles with GMing practice\u2014the barbarian is probably my favorite of the four DW classes I\u2019ve played (the other three are paladin, ranger, and my monk experiment). I love the fact that cultural character and cultural diversity are central to the class, especially considering that I need not play a grunting savage.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410608/#Comment_410608" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T14:48:09+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  2:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410614/#Comment_410614" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T16:03:40+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  4:03PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lula, that is so full of win!
