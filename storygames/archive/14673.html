Two of my buddies came to play (Jarad and Arnold, who is Harlequin on the boards here) and we sat around for like ten minutes hoping for a third. Finally, a guy named Campbell walked over and joined us because the D&amp;D table where he was originally was too full.<br/><br/>Campbell picked first (I told him to, Arnold and Jarad had played before) and he chose Arkam. I told Arnold he couldn't choose Snargle (because he's played him in two different Lady B games I've run), so he took Captain Vance. Jarad chose Lady Blackbird herself.<br/><br/>Events of the game:<br/>* As I discussed in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14571&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">my last AP</a>, I was worried about the initial scene setting up repetition. So I cribbed off your suggestions and set them up in a suspended giant crow's cage that moved on a chain track with many others. The metal lattice-work floor beneath was guarded by clockwork automatons and underneath the floor, the entire area was exposed to the open air. The brig itself would sometimes be submerged into the Lower Depths, subjecting the unfortunate prisoners to the corrosive air of the bottom of the worlds from time to time. It was fun because it set things up very differently and kicked the game off in a fun direction<br/>* When Captain Vance blew his first couple rolls trying to help the group escape their prison, Jarad decided Lady Blackbird was less than impressed; he then spent the rest of the game having Lady Blackbird try to convince the rest of the crew to serve her (including the other PC Kale Arkam)<br/>* Arnold played up the outcast part of Captain Vance, making him somewhat antisocial and bossy. When Lady Blackbird spurned his advances early on, he bought off Key of Requited Love. This quickly turned the feel of the game on its ear<br/>* As their escape progressed, the game turned again when Arkam was asked to choose between helping Lady Blackbird for the promise of great sums of money or staying loyal to his captain; Campbell bought off Key of Fraternity and turned on the captain<br/>* Split up and hiding in the Hand of Sorrow on full alert, the crew sans Captain Vance finds the Hangar holding The Owl; on a whim, I describe that The Owl is sitting right beside an extremely shiny new ship, one flown by a royal ambassador who happens to be on board; Lady Blackbird and Arkam decide to take The Owl, and nearly leave Captain Vance behind, but luckily, the captain shows up and convinces Snargle to fly The Owl while Arkam flies the Iron Butterfly (after buying the Pilot trait and a tag to go with it)<br/>* Captain Vance tries to convinces Snargle to leave the Iron Butterfly to the perils of the Hand of Sorrows cannons, but Snargle's conscience gets the better of him and he flies The Owl in front of a barrage, taking the smuggler skyship down to Busted and Leaking and Lost in the Lower Depths while Lady Blackbird flies to safety<br/>* After a comical scene of Captain Vance throwing all of the "mutineer's gear" into his bootlocker, along with Snargle finding a few of his belongings that <i>just happened</i> to have been in Arkam's cabin, Lady Blackbird calls out over the wireless and offers a rescue<br/>* The Iron Butterfly creeps into the Lower Depths and Lady Blackbird summons a great wind to push back the Lower Depths so Vance can tether the ships and Arkam can crawl back on board The Owl to fix her (and "unfix" some of the damage Snargle did to her trying to fix her himself); Vance confronts Arkam and as the two argue over the mutiny, a gun is drawn and the two former friends are about to duel, then we ended the game<br/><br/>Thoughts:<br/>* When Arkam and Vance bought off their keys of connection to other characters, the game went to a dark dysfunctional place very quickly; with Lady Blackbird conniving and Vance's fuming, the game had an incredibly unusual tone<br/>* I found myself interested in exploring this three-way battle, so NPCs faded into the background and became little more than set dressing; this wasn't true of Snargle, however; I feel a strong affinity for the goblin and found myself using him to reach out to Vance during his pained loss of his friend and ally and Snargle also served as a bit of comic relief (I also found myself doing a rough Russel Brand impersonation for Snargle, a voice I may have a hard time shaking out of my head for future NPC-ing of him)<br/>* Bishop slid into the role of being more like a piece of equipment for Lady Blackbird, a hammer used to threaten or bludgeon others when needed; she mirrored the angst of the story, spewing hatred freely and reacting to everyone with some quiet venom - she was scary<br/><br/>It was a unique game of Lady Blackbird. It flew in the face of the opening crawl (the boxed text on page one), but the characters still fulfilled what was on their character sheets. I was intrigued with the game, enjoyed many of the moments and the dialogue. I especially loved playing with Campbell, a guy who admitted he'd played mostly D&amp;D and White Wolf games, but had a craving for something different. It was fun to watch him open up to Keys and taking his own XP and the broad strokes of conflict resolution as I usually run it in Lady Blackbird. He also took Arkam in this mocking self-confident air I'd never seen, it was interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333933/#Comment_333933" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T20:11:43+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:11PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've reflected on the game a bit more. I'm happy to have played, had a good time. But most of all, I learned how critical those Keys are to the romance and adventure of the game. Once they were bought off, the game took on a mercenary feel. I think I threw in the Iron Butterfly to see how far it would go. <br/><br/>Its weird. Last game I ran, the player of Snargle bought off Key of Conscience early and it really changed the tone. Now this game, Unrequited Love and Fraternity are bought off and it really changed the tone. Its as if those Keys are a kind of High Concept (to borrow from Dresden) for those characters, at least as I've normally seen them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333937/#Comment_333937" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T20:29:41+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:29PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For 1 shot play you might want to restrict buying off the key to a climactic final scene, or require a simultaneous pick up of the new concept key that replaces it.  Over multiple sessions I bet that initial Key-less chaos would have settled into a new routine and been pretty great character development...but in a one shot, you don't necessarily have the time to wait on subtle development to evolve naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333942/#Comment_333942" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T21:22:16+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  9:22PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Ralph.

Needless to say, Vance's love key was one of the first things to go, which in retrospect makes you question why it was there in the first place (not from a design perspective, but why did Vance fall in love if it's obviously not something he'd do with this person).<br/><br/>(In that same game it turned out that Blackbird was actually gunning for the Pirate King and fought him in the end, which was a fun twist.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334378/#Comment_334378" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T18:26:26+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  6:26PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear what you guys are saying, but really, I like playing Lady B as is. Giving someone a pretty sheet that says here are the rules, then listing out the "other rules" seems uncool to me. But that's just me, perhaps.<br/><br/>Maybe my brief AP didn't justify or illustrate it, but the fiction in that session supported Vance buying off Key of Unrequited Love... Lady Blackbird openly mocked him and tried to recruit his first mate. The fiction also supported Arkam buying off Key of Fraternity... Lady Blackbird had just tempted him hard core with gobs of gold to turn on Vance and doing so also meant he would be taking over a shinier, newer skyship, so his Key of Greed was a good justification of the buyoff.<br/><br/>I just saw it as a possible way the story could go and when I compare it to previous ways, it was less fun for me. But it was still interesting, in a multiverse kind of way. Like, this was Elseworlds Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>(Lady Blackbird fighting the Pirate King sounds wicked awesome)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334401/#Comment_334401" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T20:24:54+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  8:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a game I designed, I had Key-like mechanics, but instead of "buying them off" I just have them transform ("invert").
