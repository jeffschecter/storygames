I'm referring to these as "ruins"; the adventuring party is covering the terrain of a Fallen Civilization, and has to track its resources along the way. They'll set up camp outside the Darkfell Manor, and the adventurers who are ready will go in, and spend a session delving that "dungeon". Maybe at a different time they'll camp outside the Shadowfell DarkWell, where they must rappel down several hundred feet to enter the dungeon, and this is known to be a committed two-session dungeon, but not much more than that.<br/><br/>Any push to make things more episodic will certainly weaken the strategic / resource-management focus somewhat. I feel like this could still be dungeon-y, though, and still make some fictional sense.<br/><br/>Here's what the fictional explanation could look like:<br/><br/><i>One thousand years ago, the the Empire of Grey Leaves fell to its own inevitable corruption. Long ago, the powerful of the republic built their estates, prisons, and fortresses on top of sources of powerful mana flows, often using their magic to carve deep caves into the rock below. However, the overreliance on Mana corrupted the hearts of the leaders, and they fell into wicked heresy and vise.<br/><br/>It is now a barbaric age, with few points of light amidst the great ruins. In walled cities, the people fence themselves off from the corrupted magic of the old world. However, some adventurers must enter the ruins - to find some ancient treasure, to defeat encroaching monstrosities, and to eventually reclaim the territory of the fallen empire.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200902/#Comment_200902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T10:42:24+00:00" title="April  6, 2009 10:42AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 10:43AM by Daniel H..">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, have you seen Ben Robbins's <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a> stuff?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200919/#Comment_200919" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T11:37:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2009 11:37AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a cool idea.

What if, after each week's episode, the areas of dungeon that have been cleared out and declared safe get resettled? In effect, a steadily growing town would follow the heroes as they plunge deeper as wandering merchants set up their tents and eventually take possession of the dungeon's various rooms. Not only do you have the advantage of episodic play, but the world will genuinely shape itself around the players' actions.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200950/#Comment_200950" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:01:06+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>Yeah, I think the concept would work very well under 4th Edition.</blockquote>\nIf you don't mind having all your work done for you, there's a book for 4th Edition that WotC recently put out called Dungeon Delve.

I've been experimenting with flashbacks in RPGs recently, and one of the things I've had rattling around in my head (which I'll actually start a new thread about) is the idea of the "Canterbury Tales" game, wherein the characters are all on an adventure together, and then they all take turns telling stories/having flashbacks to their own personal story that somehow influences the events of the current story.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of the "modular dungeon", wherein  you're not building towards any -specific- endpoint, so having players not make it to a session is not a big deal, because the core of the group can assemble a different "team of specialists" for the next bit of delve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey" title="VacuumJockey"><img alt="VacuumJockey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey">VacuumJockey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201165/#Comment_201165" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T15:11:24+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  3:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a chaotic demi-god named Count Gravity in my campaign.

Many a skeleton filing clerk's skull was crushed by my Staff of Wands that night!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
