It's called The Philosopher's Stone and it's my attempt to adapt the Blood Red Sands system to a more "traditional role playing" style.  From my reading of the BRS rules, and with a few years of Universalis experience behind me, I believe that the Blood Red Sands is a major positive step in the evolution of Universalis.  By replacing the coins of Universalis with dice, BRS introduces relative differences between traits, an element of risk into contesting for narrative control, and a competitive framework for play. I think these differences can allow it to support traditional role playing better than Universalis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Philosopher's Stone, players each have a PC and some character components (like a horse, magic sword, rocket ship, hockey mask, chainsaw, whatever) that they keep and grow from session to session, like in a normal role playing game.  They also get "story components" that are NPCs, traps, geographical features, devices, etc. which they use against the other players (this keeps the competitive structure of BRS).  Like in BRS, there is no GM and players all share the load of creating the story.  Unlike in BRS, the players cooperate to create an overall story structure before fleshing out the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay is structured as a "mission" which is divided into "acts," with each act taking roughly a session, so an act corresponds to an "ordeal" in BRS.  What is different is that each player contributing the name of an act, an option objective for an act, and an optional starting event at the mission creation stage.  When mission creation is finished, you'll have a map of the mission with the location of the acts, objective for some or all of the acts, starting events for some or all of the acts, and an overall objective for the entire mission.  This is different from BRS, because the players define objectives and events for the acts.  What is also different is that each player is playing their character at the same time.  In BRS, only one player is playing their hero at any given time, while the rest are playing factions.<br/>\n<br/>\nActs are played out in scenes, like ordeals in BRS.  Unlike in BRS, the Narrator (i.e. Chronicler from BRS) may initiate attacks, and the players have "default narrative control," like in a normal RPG (i.e. the players can "create fiction" about their components whenever they want, unless the Narrator disallows it).  The Narrator is allowed to interrupt at any time and veto any player statements like in a normal RPG (except leaving a scene and initiating an attack, which use normal BRS mechanics).  Players can still contest for the position of Narrator, like in BRS.<br/>\n<br/>\nBRS' system contains interesting social checks and balances with its rules for challenge, joining/leaving scenes, contests, and attacks (clashes).  I think these are sufficient to counteract any favoritism that may arise from the player who is the current Narrator controlling his own character while narrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's my link:  http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t2dRjWLcTTgRCf6if0T3b-g&amp;output=html  Please tell me your impressions and ask me any questions you have.  And take it out for a spin if you dare!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Burdick                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
