I should by all sense, considering my current and successful highly heterodox OSR campaign that's completely based on module material, but it seems that I'm just happy with the original text. This is probably because I've worked hard to develop a methodology that spins uneven module material into all seven sorts of excellence in actual play; this process has simultaneously apparently blinded me to detail, as being critical isn't conducive to working with what you've got. As I see it, the module has plenty of weirdness to turn into awesome in the process of play as long as the group has the flow down.<br/><br/>Well, this isn't so much awesome, but were I running this module in our campaign, I'd go ahead and connect it into a web of other otherworldly scenarios with a similar theme. There's a smaller one in Fight On! about a busted Venusian spacewreck, and then there's the Spire of Iron and Crystal, that sort of thing; by having an ample backing of stuff that I'm ready to drop in the players' laps I'll enable a wide strategic scope for them, with room even for mistakes. They could research the matter and end up investigating the wrong spaceship, or they could find hints or outright adventure hooks for further adventures in the same line, perhaps culminating in finding a stargate of some sort, to pick arbitrary examples of the types of interactions that are made possible by expanding the scope of your prep beyond the immediate location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357381/#Comment_357381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T13:45:25+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  1:45PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Describe it without outright saying it's an alien ship.

In our campaign these types of choices have been the major, major pivot points around which the game has revolved: when the players first chose to dare the unknown imperial hinterlands in hopes of adventure, for example, that was entirely on them once I gave them the chance. Similarly they've been messing with the unreliable planar magics of the Alder Gate lately, and it's all about strict player pacing: the players choose whether to do a familiar dungeon any given session or whether to go for new territory. It's the same choice as whether to go down a dungeon level or whether to abandon one dungeon for another, really: strategic choices are the brew of champions in D&amp;D, it seems to me.<br/><br/>Other modules that might be relevant in this context are <i>Tower of the Stargazer</i> (an unreliable method of interplanetary travel plus an entirely credible sage+library on the topic) and of course, <i>Carcosa</i> and <i>Fomalhaut</i>, both of which are in my own "campaign galaxy" as well-detailed worlds that explicitly exist a starship jaunt away from Earth (or other campaign world taking its place in the galactic scheme). A straightforward move would be to simply decide that the Barrier Peaks ship originates with the same Grey aliens that visit Carcosa so often - they certainly have that same pulp scifi feel, just a few details would need to be changed. I myself try to find these types of connections wherever possible, as D&amp;D modules span such large memetic spaces that you gotta grab the similarities when you spot them. Like, no sense having two fantasy Egypts in your campaign world, all of them's pyramid adventures are gonna happen in the same place. Probably all desert modules in general, if the campaign mostly spends its time in more rainy regions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357595/#Comment_357595" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T11:39:52+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2012 11:40AM by rafial.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>But if I adjust my thinking to make the starship a lens through which the starfaring society can be examined, then I feel like I've unlocked some potent stuff.
