This is way outside my realm of familiarity, so I'm turning to you folks for advice.<br/><br/>For context, every year during October I host a small haunted house. It's a month-long project with the builders getting together on the weekends or early weeknights and working long hours in to the night. This year we also have some of the neighborhood kids as volunteers, which has changed the group dynamic a bit. They aren't well-suited to the kind of hours and intensity we usually put in, and they don't know us very well, so we're taking a more relaxed schedule this year and spending some time in the evenings hanging out and playing games. I'd like to offer up a few storygames, but I'm not entirely sure there's anything suitable. I have my eye on <a href="http://ndpdesign.com/haunted" rel="nofollow">Haunted</a> and possibly Psi*Run, but that's it so far. <br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422209/#Comment_422209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T13:20:52+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  1:20PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Action Castle.

The game was really easy to run even for a dozen people at once, it was very forgiving of people just getting up and leaving or showing up partway through, and a good game of it is about an hour and a half to two hours at most, so it's easier on the attention span than many games. It's very simple to learn so youth or inexperience won't get in the way, and while its default tone is crazy space adventures (eg classic Trek, Farscape), it wouldn't be hard to do it as a spookier episode of the show, with the ship powered down, or making a big deal of Captain Darcy's psychic entity in his head, or an Alien-esque scenario (minus the horrible gore and elements that turn it to an R rating).<br/><br/>Of course, even in a spookier scenario, it's still sci-fi, and as such might not be appropriate for a haunted house deal. I suggest it for its simplicity, its ease with which it can handle large groups, and how it is very forgiving of lower attention spans. Just seemed like the perfect game with regard to "big group with kids".<br/>Maybe it could be hacked into a more appropriate setting. I dunno. Good luck, this is a cool event you're doing!<br/><br/>Oh, and here's a link to it: <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lasers &amp; Feelings PDF</a><br/><br/>I also totally agree with Adam that Parsely games are fantastic for this. Along with Action Castle, Pumpkin Town seems very suited to the context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422218/#Comment_422218" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T15:31:26+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  3:31PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could run <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a> for them; though I'm unsure how well you can learn how to run the game from just the scant English-language draft available. <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> , what do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422219/#Comment_422219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T16:46:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  4:46PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Action Castle is a good suggestion for groups of any size.<br/><br/>InSpectres would probably work for a more normal RPG experience: you can easily run a short adventure or two for large-ish groups in a few hours, and don't need to be totally serious or anything (so works fine for the tweens).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422220/#Comment_422220" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T16:55:58+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  4:55PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eight people is a lot for most tabletop games.
