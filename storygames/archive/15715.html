You can play a game about fighting (typically, squad-based skirmish fighting) or piloting stuff (typically, small spaceships or mechs, also involving fighting). There's edge cases, sure, but I think it's safe to say the majority of tactical gameplay is really zeroed in on these two activities.<br/><br/>So, this is a brainstorming and workshopping thread. What ideas do you have for RPGs that reward tactical gameplay and crunch, but that aren't about fighting or piloting? How would you support those ideas? What would the product/product line include? Just saying "a game about horse racing" is an uninteresting response for these purposes - I want to know how you'd turn that idea into a tactics-focused RPG.<br/><br/>Bonus points if your ideas play off these ideas in other games, because that's where my head is at: distinct character classes, character powers/stunts/moves, distinct missions/instances/events/encounters.<br/><br/>I've got an idea that I'm going to post here in the next post. I'm super delighted if you challenge it, riff off it, ask about it, etc. I'm also super delighted if you introduce your own game ideas. I'll try to challenge them, riff off them, ask about them, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356320/#Comment_356320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T13:11:50+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  1:11PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had an architect-fight in that Mist-Robed Gate game, remember that?<br/><br/>Mouse Guard can already handle a lot of tactical situations other than fighting: journeys, chases, arguments, etc.  Likewise, AW is pretty crunchy for my tastes and can do all sorts of non-violent things.<br/><br/>(Also: Game Chef 2012.

The PCs are the few individuals in this community skilled and passionate enough to help rescue and support endangered animals. The game involves navigating a mixture of domestic animal concerns, rescuing (or relocating) wild animals, and dealing with pervasive community issues (unlicensed hunting, habitat destruction, animal cruelty, etc).<br/><br/>The Characters: I'm imagining that there are a number of classes for characters. The Veterinarian has surgical abilities and connections to medical supplies. The Shelter Worker has animal empathy abilities and connections to pet owners. The Activist has awareness-raising abilities and connections to community organizations. The Warden has protection abilities and connections to the legal system. Each class contains a number of Skills to pick from. These are structured like Powers in D&amp;D4e, but are a bit more loosely defined. Like, The Activist might have "<b>Show of Solidarity</b>: When you manage to bring disparate community groups together in a visible sign of protest or solidarity, roll 2d6 + the number of community groups present. Subtract this score from the Community Crisis." I don't know. Something like that?<br/><br/>The Situations: I think there would be a couple different categories of Crisis that play would alternate between: Medical Crisis, Behavioral Crisis, Rescue Crisis, Community Crisis, etc. The GM would have to construct those types of Crises slightly differently, choosing from different option lists. The players' moves would target specific Crisis types.<br/><br/>Achievements: The GM would toss out lots of hooks, some more pressing than others. When the players do something new, they unlock an Achievement (which grants some cool thing). When the players repeat an Achievement, they mark experience. There'd be a different mechanical benefit for branching out (say, helping relocate a wounded cougar for the first time) versus continuing to demonstrate excellence (say, helping give birth to calves, again).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356322/#Comment_356322" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T13:16:22+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  1:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

That's totally got good handling of non-combat tactical situations. Good call.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is not really what I'm talking about. The tactical elements are (by design) sloppy. They aren't gamist, they aren't concretely delineated, they aren't balanced for tactical gameplay. And much of it is really geared towards combat and violence. I'm looking for a game that gives the experience promised in D&amp;D4e (cool powers and roles! tactical gameplay! fun situation manipulation games to play with your friends!) but doesn't ever ask the players to participate in violence or imperialistic campaigning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356324/#Comment_356324" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T13:18:39+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  1:18PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always wanted to create a competitive game of courtly intrigue where your actions increase/decrease your honor toward becoming the "lord of the realm"  or something.  I've been toying around with all sorts of ideas, particularly using my love of grammar (adverbs in this case!) toward mechanical aims.  My current idea is that each player/class/what-have-you has a set of adverbs relevant to their play style.  For example, a cloak-and-dagger courtier might have the adverb "stealthily" or "invisibly" as an outcome for a successful role.<br/><br/>Regardless of what I come up with, I've been heavily influenced by a book my father has wanted me to read for years: James Clavell's <i>Shogun</i>.  Guided by intertwining plots that are teeming with betrayal and intrigue, I feel that several elements of this period of Japanese history could be very integral to the game.  So far I've come up with ideas like iaijutsu (which, I will say from experience, is wonderfully complex), aizuchi, etc.  I think these could be successfully driven with crunchy mechanical aims.  So far, it's been slow going, but I'm really glad this thread exists now, cause now I can see what others might include.<br/><br/>On a side note, a lot of "intrigue" based mechanics remind me of trick-taking card games.  You want to win a circumstance to gain priority in a situation, but you also want to save your best cards for when you need them most (and often when you least expect to need them!!!).  Maybe that could be a source of inspiration.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>~Klaus                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356333/#Comment_356333" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T13:32:05+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  1:32PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sort of off topic, but part of what inspired this idea (of tactical non-combat RPGs) a while ago was thinking about how my brother used to play with <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=7500&amp;e=thumbnail&amp;pcat=hero_world_rh" rel="nofollow">Rescue Heroes</a>.

Ben's character was a loafing artist, Alan's character was a proselytizing cleric. Thanks to the system - which demands that conflicts be of any type, not just combat - the conflicts were as edge-of-seat gripping, deep and interesting as any tactical combat. One conflict was trying to convert a royal family during an imperial wedding party, the other big conflict was a three-day art contest to the death.<br/><br/>Give that system another read, it's worth it.<br/><br/>Now, have a PC or Mac?

Winter Voices basically one-ups that. In it you have to make emotional connections to people. You do that by engaging them in combat: You fight off your own and their self doubt, ennui, unresolved issues and other psychological traumas and hangups manifest as blobs and mosntrous shapes. You fight them (with damage, "hp" equivalent etc) with attack abilities like Persistance, Altruism, Utilitarianism, Super-Ego, Inspiration, Creativity, Maturity, and so on.<br/><br/>A review: <a href="http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/software/1281709/beyond-the-pillars-winter-voices" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/software/1281709/beyond-the-pillars-winter-voices</a><br/><br/>It's... really pretty cool an idea. I found the game a little too slow/languid for my tastes ultimately, but I couldn't deny the genius of the concept.

There are lots and lots of very tactical board games whose colour -- which often though not always informs the mechanics -- is almost entirely non-violent, or includes only a few violent options. City-building, civilization expansion, farming, architecture, exploration/pillaging, fighting disease -- all things that have been transformed into fully tactical/strategic board games.<br/><br/>And I guess my abstract-theory question is also: would this shift in fictional focus necessitate different mechanics -- like, fundamentally different, in some important way -- than the mechanics we already use to model  violent conflict? If Mouse Guard and TSoY qualify, then maybe it's just a matter of reskinning things into non-violent situations? Because I do feel like maybe MG and TSoY's conflict mechanics do assume a certain sort of violence to the conflict, even if that violence is social or emotional -- but maybe that's not really true, it's just an impression I have because I am so used to thinking of conflict as a violent confrontation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356379/#Comment_356379" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T16:10:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  4:10PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy H and I were working on a tactical roller derby game for a while until we realized we were really creating a boardgame, and we weren't interested in pursuing it further.<br/><br/>So, that is to say, sports competitions are rife with opportunities for non-combat tactical crunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356384/#Comment_356384" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T16:24:00+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  4:24PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>Andy H and I were working on a tactical roller derby game for a while until we realized we were really creating a boardgame, and we weren't interested in pursuing it further.</blockquote>\nIf it's any consolation, Vulpinoid is working on a roller derby board game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356399/#Comment_356399" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T17:09:17+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  5:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Politics?<br/><br/>"I roll a 19 to hit, and do 9 points of damage.

Global business 'conflict', trying to increase stock value and market share in three general market types, worldwide. Had a neat, abstract-ish hex-gridded world map, too. It wasn't great, but it had a distinctly different feel than Supremacy, or Risk, to name a few other world-conquest games.<br/><br/>But then again, it really was a world-conquest game...hm.<br/><br/>I'd suggest looking at Diaspora's social combat chapter. Their ideas on FATE-tactical maps for social conflicts is pretty neat.<br/><br/>How about this: Doctors Without Borders/MSF, the NGORPG. PCs are doctors or aid workers of some variety, with D&amp;Dish stats, skills &amp; other attributes. The map is areas, not squares - like Fate's zones. Your quests? Go and do doctory/relief stuff in some very dangerous places. You could include equivalents of several RPG tropes:<br/><br/>Getting all the stuff you need to go into the wilderness/dungeon? Getting the stuff you need to go to the un(der)developed countries, war zones, disaster areas.<br/><br/>Quests? Same thing! Help these refugees, treat these disaster victims, stop that disease outbreak. <br/><br/>Environmental hazards? Remain the same, plus if it's a disaster, whatever caused it might still be going on. Floods, monsoons, aftershocks, etc.<br/><br/>Opposition? Plenty. Bureaucratic red tape from outside or in the targeted country. Can you get pass the local officials? Are they upstanding or corrupt? Are there any at all? What about local criminals, bandits or worse? You don't have weapons, at all. Every combat is a social combat. 'Maneuver' is how you plan to deal with the immediate, local problems. 'Attacks' are how you execute those plans. Can you talk the bandit types out of stealing your supplies? Do they just want help, or are they more predatory? Will the local security forces be present, arrive in time, or even intervene? Let alone the opposition of the conditions you're trying to solve in the first place.<br/><br/>Grander personal conflict? How do you maintain MSFs neutrality in the face of challenges? What can you do to effect changes in the situation that brought you to this place?<br/><br/>The more I go on about this, the more I think Mouse Guard's 'big pond, little fish' dynamic might work out.

If you have a Scout skill of 1 and we need you to Attack in a Journey conflict, or whatever, that sucks for us.  The tactics of Mouse Guard are patrol-based, not individual, though. You have to work with your fellow players (some of whom may just decide to do their own thing) to be successful, and that makes it interesting.<br/><br/>Joe, I could also write several pages about the tactics of AW and its hacks, all of which are based on fictional positioning and don't necessarily have any reason to involve violence.  But if you're not considering that to be tactical... I'm not sure what to tell you.  Personally, I find purely mechanical tactics that aren't strongly connected to the fiction (like most of the tactics in 4E) to not be very interesting (they're just like an abstract board game, essentially, and could represent anything), while the tactics of fictional positioning in AW hacks are fascinating.

The stuff that's super in-line with the tactical-crunchy-gameplay is picking a playbook and special moves, and also combat (using the full battle rules &amp; harm rules). But I think that most of the non-combat-oriented moves fail to touch on what excites me about this thread idea - moves overlap and are unbalanced, fictional positioning matters more than mechanical positioning, etc.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just drawing an arbitrary line in the sand, here. I kind of consider FATE to be "just barely what I'm talking about" and Apocalypse World to be "not really what I'm talking about." But something falling outside of my definitions doesn't mean it can't be discussed here by everyone else, obviously, because I have no despotic or hypnotic powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356477/#Comment_356477" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-28T12:22:36+00:00" title="January 28, 2012 12:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2012 2:01PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread.

I genuinely meant it when I wrote what I wrote below.) <br/><br/>Anyway, yes, cheers to this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356482/#Comment_356482" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-28T13:08:59+00:00" title="January 28, 2012  1:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is "tactics" to you guys? <br/><br/>Clever fictional positioning or mini-games? <br/>I would say the former, enabling the possibility (and advantages) for the later.<br/><br/>This definition doesn't capture the crunchiness though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356484/#Comment_356484" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-28T13:46:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2012  1:46PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>What is "tactics" to you guys?</blockquote>\nThis may be an unfruitful avenue of discussion.

What does and doesn't count is going to be different for everyone, and avoiding terminology wars is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>Maybe instead, we can answer "What kinds of tactics are you (each of you) interested in exploring, in this context?"<br/><br/>My answer is: exception-based powers (ref: Magic cards, D&amp;D4e powers); Flexible-but-Concrete Character Archetypes (ref: Apocalypse World, classes in some games); subsystems that require strategic thinking and that reward gamist play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356642/#Comment_356642" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T18:08:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  6:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>What ideas do you have for RPGs that reward tactical gameplay and crunch, but that aren't about fighting or piloting?</blockquote>\nTake a deep look at <a href="http://www.myheroicjourney.com/mecha/" rel="nofollow">Mecha</a>. It's based around character scenes that feed into a tactical mech combat scene; however, the tactics are done mostly abstractly, with Mechs maneuvering on a "bullseye"-like map, where the important things are spatial relations to other Mechs. It is possible to take this system, changing only the labels you give things, to make this "tactical crunch" about something totally other than combat. Political maneuvering comes to mind, but other things are also possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356751/#Comment_356751" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T11:36:09+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 11:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Local 615: Call for Solidarity</b><br/><br/>This one might be a board game.<br/><br/>You're the movers and shakers of Union Local 615.

But, like, it's too broad for me to approach in a meaningful way. Local 615 was an idea that would be specific enough to be tangible. There are concrete roles in that situation, there are distinct approaches possible (rank-and-file mobilization, accommodationist business unionism, enlisting the union central, community-based activism, etc). It's specific enough to be easy to codify and design around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356764/#Comment_356764" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T12:23:17+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 12:23PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Hey, it just occurred to me that FreeMarket is crunchy non-combat and can be tactical if you want it to be.</blockquote>\nTotally good call.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356767/#Comment_356767" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T12:35:48+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 12:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That book that I never tire of pimping, The World Tamer's Handbook from Traveller: New Era, has good support for tactical crunchy non-combat games.<br/><br/>A random example of what I mean:  At Tech Level 3, windmills cost 0.01 MegaCredits per kilowatt of output and run at an efficiency of 30 percent.
