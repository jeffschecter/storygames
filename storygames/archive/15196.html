II'm not entirely sure what might serve this purpose.  I don't care too much about genre as long as it allows a measure of player input.<br/><br/>Possibilities I thought of were: Annalise, Remember Tomorrow or In A Wicked Age<br/><br/>I know Annalise can do the trick and have heard that IAWA might be a bit too brutal.

Every time I've played it, the game has been evocative, compelling, emotional, and much less squicky than I initially expected. Playing through the natural arc of the game seems to take around 6-8 sessions, depending on how heavy you hit the missions. Hopefully the upcoming version (pretty much exactly the same, just with new art and some updated descriptions) will solidify it's place as one of the best indie games out there, period.  I was working on a Matrix-inspired gnostipunk hack for a while, "The Bliss-Robed Lie," and I keep picking at it every year or two because the game is just so solid.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage is also good as a gateway into more GM-less/ful play because every player has 2+ characters and there's a quasi-leader/GM-like role (the only adult) in the beginning, though that can change dramatically over the course of play.  I've seen the adult character die, quit, bliss out, get replaced, etc., which is really where the training wheels come off.  The refresh scenes are also one of the best intros into more freeform/experimental play out there.  I could gush more, but you get the idea.  <br/><br/>Highly recommended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345462/#Comment_345462" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T14:49:54+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  2:49PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to suggest "Capes";  It is a fun GM-less/full superhero game.

This is doubly interesting to me both as one who doubts "GM" even makes sense as a cohesive <i>concept</i>, and because I have a thing for <i>Bliss Stage</i> and it ranks very high in my "I've gotta play a full campaign of this" wishlist.<br/><br/>Back to the OP\u2026<br/><br/>Piers, I'm surprised nobody suggested <i>Polaris</i>. I haven't had the opportunity to complete a full game of it without making recourse to speed-up rule variants, sadly, but when I was able to take my time and <i>expected</i> a full game, maybe one Knight got to Veteran by session 3rd, while most of them still had some way to go\u2026 Thus "about 6 sessions" looks like a good estimate of length at that pace.<br/>Or maybe it's just that I can't play like 'em Americans?<br/><br/>I also second Jason's suggestion of <i>Archipelago</i>.<br/><br/>More suggestions:<br/><br/>Know that with <i>Shock: Social Science Fiction</i> you can play a cycle of stories happening in the same "world", though not necessarily with the same *Tagonists (in fact, you're probably going to change most or all *Tagonists each session). And if 6 instalments is maybe far-fetched for "vanilla" Shock, it looks quite right to me for a <i>Human Contact</i> game.<br/><br/><i>Perfect, Unrevised</i>. I can't warrant your game will last for six instalments, but it seems likely enough to me, especially when that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/><i>The Drifter's Escape</i>. Unlike most games in this list, you'll be playing differentiated roles, and those won't rotate during the game - so that you're going to have, for example, a fixed "hero" player (the Drifter). None of those roles, though, fits in the "GM" mold.<br/><br/><i>Hot Guys Making Out</i>.

This is doubly interesting to me both as one who doubts "GM" even makes sense as a cohesive  <i>concept</i>, and because I have a thing for <i>Bliss Stage</i> and it ranks very high in my "I've gotta play a full campaign of this" wishlist.</blockquote>\nI'm not Jonathan, but I have played and loved Bliss Stage.  He was very right to describe it as "GM-less/ful", because while the role of the GM does exist, a lot of its traditional duties are spread around the table.  The entire group creates the setting and chooses the Hopes that define the campaign, and while the GM does play the Authority Figure and assigns missions, during the mission segments the Anchoring players are basically in charge of narrating the state of the dream world and responding to the Pilot players until they roll poorly enough to tip the dream over into a nightmare-- and thanks to the Otherkind dice setup, the Pilot players are basically narrating their own success and failures depending on where they choose to assign their dice.<br/><br/>It really is a marvelous little game (can't wait for the next edition), and actually I think it might secretly be the ideal ruleset for Wraith: the Oblivion, especially a Doomslayers game (it's super easy to reskin things like Anchor=Shadow, dream=Labyrinth, Blissing Out=Oblivion etc, which changes a lot of context without really changing the mechanics, or to do a crazy mash-up of the two so only the wraiths caught between the worlds of living and dead can harness the emotional connections with Skinlands and Shadowlands characters to save the living from the invasion of Spectres they can't even perceive). I wish my one shot at it so far had managed to go longer than 2-3 sessions.  So many games, so little time!<br/><br/>Um, this game isn't GMless as written, but my group all agree that the role of the GM in Smallville seems downright vestigial-- much like Bliss Stage, the entire group creates the setting from scratch by picking a high concept and then populating it with characters, locations, and the relationships binding them all (character creation in this game is AMAZING; it takes a whole session but I've never seen it be anything less than delightful), so the PCs always start the game with lots of context and chemistry for how they all relate to one another.  In my experience, this tends to mean the players sort of make their own gravy; there's almost always several intraparty dramabombs ready to go off, so the PCs can easily end up scheming and scrapping against one another without the GM needing to do more than just get them in the same room.  Large parts of the sessions I've run have gone by without me even needing to play an NPC.  The game is also very open to player contributions/dramatic editing during play-- FATE was clearly a big influence on it.<br/><br/>If you want to go out near the farthest borders of what can be called an RPG, or even a game, Microscope is also pretty great.  The fractal way you zoom in and out of periods of history could easily provide several sessions worth of material if you're all willing to keep exploring your setting.  I've played it several times, but never the same setting twice...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345526/#Comment_345526" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T04:07:13+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  4:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Joe said.

Walton</cite>What Joe said. The role is called a "GM" but it's not really a traditional GM role in any sense. Confusing!</blockquote>\nOK, I got it. But then, well, there would be literally <i>hundreds</i> of games (thousands?) which fit the bill, depending on how you define "traditional GM". Possibly including, I dunno, Dogs in the Vineyard, or Mountain Witch, or even Apocalypse World \u2014 which is, we learn, what the OP's group's trying to move away from.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a>: curiously, my experience w/Apocalypse World as the MC is also of having some\u2026 performance anxiety myself, but not really related to prep. In my experience, it's a game which runs on very little prep: go figure!<br/><br/>But really, then, the main issues here seem to be:<br/><br/>\xb7 games that require no prep whatsoever (in the sense of homework, stuff you do on your own before showing up for the game). Of these there are a lot, both with a titular "GM" or not.<br/><br/>\xb7 games where everybody's on the same ground, so less performance anxiety is involved. Note that there are also games where you have a titular "GM" or some other special role, but they don't do quite as much talking on their own, they don't stand in the spotlight as much as the MC does in AW: this is probably where Bliss Stage lies.<br/><br/>So, besides the officially "GM-full" games already mentioned in this thread, examples of games where you have a "GM" of a sort but they don't have to do any homework-type prep at all and they usually aren't in the spotlight, suitable for long-term play (or at least longer than one-shot play) include:<br/>Poison'd, The Mountain Witch (I doubt it can last 6+ sessions, though), In a Wicked Age (but you already knew), maybe some flavors of D&amp;D (especially old-school dungeon crawls) played <i>with dungeon modules</i>, On Mighty Thews, Anima Prime (w/pre-made setting), Ganakagok (6+ sessions seems too long, though, even tweaking the stars-in-the-sky count), My Life with Master\u2026 There are obviously many more, but I'm keeping to games I've played in the last couple years and books I can see scattered around the room right now.<br/><br/>For the records: the GM in Bliss Stage <i>has</i> got some little homework to do, in the form of planning missions. Missions can be just a single line of intro and a couple objectives, of course, and can usually be kept in your mind and improvised in the thick of the moment, so you can eschew homework and get away with it clean\u2026 but still I don't know whether that would fit Adam's bill or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345942/#Comment_345942" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T03:42:15+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  3:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2011 3:48AM by GB_Steve.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>I just got How We Came to Live Here in London</blockquote>\nIs that set on a council estate in Peckham?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345964/#Comment_345964" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T08:08:10+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  8:08AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>I just got How We Came to Live Here in London</blockquote>\nIs that set on a council estate in Peckham?<br/><br/>No, they were Australians who came to work in pubs (apologies to Cameron).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345965/#Comment_345965" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T08:19:54+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  8:19AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2011 8:22AM by The_Magus.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cthulahoops</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What about the GM role are you trying to avoid, in other words?</blockquote>\nWell, as the person who started off this query, I can answer that.
