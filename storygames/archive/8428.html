(I'm paraphrasing the comment, and we did talk about it at the time: I'm just opening this up.) Now I can say over and over again that I wasn't railroading, but the feeling was that I was railroading the play. Now why was that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I GM, I like to play too! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I'm not there as a facilitator for other folks fun... I wanna play as much as anyone else. This is not controversial: everyone has equal weight at the table. Sure, some folks may have different roles, but the weighting of their play is the same. When I'm a player, I like to engage in a lot of 'table chatter': I refer to the OOC and sometimes IC talk that flies around the table where you suggest stuff, and plans of action, and there's this whole furious cloud of ideas zinging back and forth. I was doing just that when we played Cold City: I'd frame a scene, and then I'd jump into the roles of the NPCs, responding to the PCs and stuff... but I was also encouraging the other players to action and getting into the scene myself, saying <i>"Wouldn't it be cool if you did this..."</i>, <i>"That lousy Yank is lying through his teeth!"</i> (was he? In my role as GM I knew, but my NPC guard didn't... I was just playing up his stereotype) and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nPost-session, one of the players made the insightful comment that the tradition of RP has generally invested the GM with a lot of authority. So when a GM is saying <i>"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if..."</i> and suchlike, then some folks are going to think that the GM is suggesting that that course of action is the right thing to do... hence the feeling of railroading. Another player said that he does the 'table chatter as GM thing' too, but that he makes sure to preface such chatter with words that make it clear that these are just suggestions or pure roleplay and so don't have any more weight at the scenario-meta-level than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else table chatter as a GM? And by that I mean specifically chatter about the PCs actions, plans, and stuff. Everything is open right, and since I feel that I'm able to make the distinction between in-character knowledge and player knowledge, the same goes for GM-knowledge and player/PC knowledge. Just because I know the beliefs and such of the NPCs doesn't mean that I will try to metagame it to the NPCs advantage... that would suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nPondering Pete                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186282/#Comment_186282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T11:43:06+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When a GM player who doesn't have the authority (by the rules) and doesn't claim the authority (explicitly during the game) gets accused of railroading, the players probably need to unlearn some old habits. The GM can help by saying stuff like, "but that's just a suggestion" and "my ideas have the same weight as yours here," but there comes a point where -- assuming they know the rules -- the players need to just own their narrative control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186283/#Comment_186283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T11:46:23+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:46AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had this problem for a little bit.

The onus is on the other players to know the rules of the game and categorize my participation correctly. I'm not responsible for their play - they can ask me to shut up if they find me distracting, and they have, but not saying anything and inventing their own rules for the game, such as "have to do what Eero suggests every time he opens his mouth" is a problem in their heads, not in mine.<br><br>On the other hand, when I say something mandated by the rules, I usually signal this clearly by emphasis or referring to the rule in question directly. I even flag my NPC portrayal based on the rules I'm basing that portrayal on. For example, I might say something like "The NPC is getting difficult, he's willing to fight you for the treasure. I can't let you get this too easily, he's an antagonist after all." So basically any player who is paying attention to the rules and procedures of the game in progress will always know why I'm saying something and whether it has some sort of procedural meaning or not.<br><br>Of course, all this means that my games are never going to give you a safe platform for pure imaginative immersion, as I'm usually not upholding much of an illusion regarding the workings of the game setting. Things happen because people want them to happen in some manner, not because an objective and invisible force makes them. The closest I get to "pure" portrayal is when I base the actions of NPCs on my character vision for them, which is also something I'll usually remark on now and then.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186287/#Comment_186287" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:03:49+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pete,<br>\n  This will obviously be compounded by the fact that some GMs say that their vote doesn't count more than any other players, passive-aggressively...<br>\n  Like the mean boss who constantly says their door is always open...<br>\nDave M                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186293/#Comment_186293" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:12:58+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First: railroading is a tool you can use.

This hadn't happened yet, but everyone though it was a good idea.  But then we blew up the city (a second time), which dashed all our plans for the Senator.  There was a "You're going off the rails!" moment, where we were like "But the senator's supposed to become Emperor, and now he can't".  Which is to say we were all railroading ourselves.  We had gotten invested in future events that hadn't been confirmed in the fiction, and we panicked hen they didn't happen that way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the city was destroyed.  Maybe the Senator will become Emperor of elsewhere, or will rule the rubble.  Or maybe that will just be another story instead of this story.  I don't know yet.  but the important thing was that we were reminded to play the game now, rather than get invested in the idea of what the future parts of the game will be.<br/><br/><br/>So, uh, perhaps table chatter becoming railroading is not necessarily tied to the GM role.  Though that invests you with some authority you might not have otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186318/#Comment_186318" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:14:03+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting...<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that when I GM, I'm very very careful about what I "table chatter" about, consciously NOT saying certain things, and, in general, keeping it to a minimum unless I'm sure it won't be misunderstood.<br/><br/>I'd never noticed it until I read this thread!<br/><br/>I wonder if it's an instinct earned after negative response from players (such as following all my table chatter as law) or simply a reaction to the traditional image of a GM as all-knowing and mysterious?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
