Specifically:<br/>- how long should I give an indie designer to make good on delivery?<br/>- what should I do if I don't get product in that time?<br/><br/>So the story is like this: I bought a PDF for an indie designer and talked it up so much not only did the group decide to play, but in mid-August three of us all all decided to get books at the same time direct from the designer. Because I was going away one of the other guys dropped the order in. The parcel came quickly, but with only one book inside (not colour like the PDF, but that is probably my fault for missing some details on the site). A query to the designer netted a quick response that it was a mix-up and the other two books would be sent that same day. But they didn't arrive and a couple of emails since haven't even been responded to. The worst bit is its affecting our interest in the game: we're sure to be sitting at the table and someone will say "what's the relevant rule" to which the response will likely be "I would look it up if I had a book".<br/><br/>If this was a big corporation I'd be on the phone long before now giving someone a piece of my mind. But we'd like to be supporters of indie designers, and I can think of heaps of reasons a lone designer is being tardy (illness, overload, life getting in the way, etc). What is reasonable here and what do I do? I don't have phone number to call, just a single email address that we're trying again. The only other option I can think of is to hit some forum in a half assed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo&amp;noredirect=1" rel="nofollow">United breaks guitars</a> way to try and get some action or at least warn others not to waste their money.<br/><br/>(I'd rather not disclose the designer if possible, because they've made some damn good games and could have missed this for a legitimate reason and this thread is about getting advice. Whisper me if you think you need to know in order to give me advice and I'll think about it.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346639/#Comment_346639" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-22T03:25:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2011  3:25AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've written to him several times, at an address you know is working (at least it was), so I suggest for you to consider the money lost.

Tell him that you don't mind the money, and want him to keep them. <br/><br/>In my experience people will go out of their way to make amends, if someone is showing a truly generous attitude.

Does anyone know what's up or how best to get in contact with him?"  Because somebody will know how to check in on the designer, see what's going on, and offer help if needed.  Sometimes indie designers drop off the face of the planet for a while because they're dealing with serious life stuff, but it's usually okay to raise an issue publicly after a couple of good-faith efforts to resolve the problem. What else can you do, right?  And if you do it in a civil fashion and not in an angry way -- less "WTF Jason why did you steal my money?" and more "Does anybody know what's going on?" -- you're more likely to end up with a positive resolution, even if it comes a bit late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346665/#Comment_346665" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-22T15:28:43+00:00" title="October 22, 2011  3:28PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My vote's with Tomas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346667/#Comment_346667" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-22T16:12:11+00:00" title="October 22, 2011  4:12PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2011 6:22PM by lumpley.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always appreciate it when someone follows up again promptly if I've lost track of something.

My example is not really the point of the thread, but I will report further progress.<br/><br/>The thing that was really getting to me was that I have other positive experiences, but this is the first experience for the person who put in the order. I thought about it overnight and I wanted to redress the balance a bit by talking about some positive experiences and hopefully getting people to pitch in their own. Ironically the first two I thought of were for Bully Pulpit and Lumpley, which I guess is Jason, Steve and Vincent's comments above showing through.<br/><br/>So two positive experiences I've had:<br/>- I found the international package order option for Fiasco Companion a little unclear (because of the limited characters in the drop-down list). After placing it I emailed to check my order was OK and Steve got back to me within a couple of hours confirming that I'd ordered what I wanted, that they had fixed the text to make it clearer and checking whether there was anything else I needed. He even emailed me later to check I downloaded the PDF OK. In other words: great customer service.<br/>- I've always had a great experience with Lumpley. Their international shipping costs are low and I'm always surprised how fast I get my books. I swear Meg is using her Maestro D "Finger's in every pie" power in reverse, because my books show up as if by magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346735/#Comment_346735" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T01:11:10+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  1:11AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good news today: two replacement books showed up that the designer sent out a couple of months ago!<br/><br/>Still a little disappointed that we had emails not replied to along the way, and I can't believe how long the postal system took, but the relief of getting home washes away most of the pain of the journey.

They may be ingenious designers all the same, and good people, trying their best (most people do).<br/><br/>I believe it will be better, for both parties, to have a great deal of patience. I'm not saying you should not expect delivery within reasonable time (1-3 weeks), but if it drags out you should try to be polite and positive in reminding the designer about your order. Try again and again, reminding him. Asking about your order 2 weeks into waiting is ok. It gives the designer the opportunity to tell you the game is underway. And if it fails to materialize, asking a second and a third time is ok too. <br/><br/>And if that fails; be generous. Tell him you'll let the claim be, and donate the money, no hard feelings. Most indie-games is so cheap it's next to robbery anyway, buying them.<br/><br/>Leave that game be, and go on to other designers and games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346739/#Comment_346739" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T03:38:23+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  3:38AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you got your books!<br/><br/>But I have to disagree, Tomas - if you take money for your work you are, at least in part, a businessman, however unsavory that is.
