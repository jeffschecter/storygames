The special edge-cases and trimmings that make your Monster of the Week verse different from any other MC. I'll start the fun off with a special Move that I pulled out after my group's Archeresque Professional "accidentally" let a mighty soul-devouring demon out of the tome it had been imprisoned in since the fall of Atlantis, bringing forth a gate directly to hell and a horde of minor demons loose to plague the world of man in addition to unleashing one bad mother fucker of a fiend.<br/><br/>In short, he and Alucard, the grim and dutiful Half-Vampire Monstrous decided that the best course of action in the face of massive destruction and chaos was to warn the vampire's lover via text message and use an Atlantean artifact they had stolen from a secret society to travel back in time to the day before Atlantis was cast into the depths by the force of horrific Lovecraftian entities unleashed by the magi's hubris.<br/><br/>That was when I pulled out this gem, which I'm quite proud of:<br/><br/><b>When you do something crazy in the past that might fuck about with the future roll</b> +Weird<br/><br/>On a 10+ it's all good. What changes occur in the present or the timeline will be largely positive or minor (your choice).<br/><br/>On a 7-9 it's a problem. Something significant and problematic is changed in the present or the timeline, but it's possible to fix it or mitigate it's effects.<br/><br/>On a 6- it's a big freaking deal. The repercussions will probably be ugly.<br/><br/>Here's another one, after the Dhampir returned home to his lover, horribly wounded and trembling with barely repressed bloodthirst (incurred on a 7-9 result to hold back from chewing on the professional)<br/><br/>Alucard,<br/><br/>Ah. Elena is delicious is she not? Perhaps a little bit too delicious, especially with you as hungry and savage as you are right now. We know it's going to be bad, but let's see how bad. Roll +Cool for me pretty please.<br/><br/>On a 10+ you stop yourself before you go over the brink and irrevocably harm the woman you love. She'll be weak and need help doing even basic things for several months, but she'll recover with time and care. You're rich, so you can afford the physical therapy and such...but do you really want to leave her alone in the state she's in?<br/><br/>On a 7-9 it's as the above, and you feel yourself taken by an entirely different type of hunger. She gives herself to you in the midst of the Kiss as she has so many times before. But she's never done so while you've carried so much of her blood inside her. Expect the arrival of a little stranger...sooner rather than later. (The player himself suggested this after he established that Half-Vampires in this setting are infertile and are unknown to produce viable offspring).<br/><br/>On a 6- you come to covered in her blood, her life ebbing away as she lies at your feet. You have but a few minutes before she passes on...far too little time for conventional medicine to save her this far from a hospital. But I hear that demon you know...Bathsheba was it? Yeah, she's always willing to help out. Or you know, perhaps you have a different idea. Whatever it is though, you better act on it quickly. She doesn't have much time left.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your Keeper<br/><br/>And finally, here's a move I busted out when the Professional (on suspension for an investigation into his potentially negligent behavior) snuck into his Agency's facilities and tried to steal back his weapons (and more) for an unauthorized dragon hunt.<br/><br/><b>When you try to steal equipment from the Agency name a few things that you want and roll</b> +Sharp<br/><br/>On a 10+ you've got them, and get out without anyone noticing anything untoward.<br/><br/>On a 7-9 you've got them, but there's a problem. You're followed by Agency officers, or else you just so happened to take the supplies or weapons with tracking chips imbedded in them.<br/><br/>On a 6- you're caught red handed. Hope you have an explanation.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing all of the crazy custom moves you've used in your games to give your MOTW verse it's special flair!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
