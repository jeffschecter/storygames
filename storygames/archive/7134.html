In fact, it's often the smaller warts and bumps that make a person <i>actually interesting </i>(to be with and to play with). Advice which relies on the beautiful, perfect people playing, is flawed. Beautiful, perfect people are boring. Also, with a little humility, I realise I have warts and bumps. I would not fit in a group of beutiful, perfect people. I would actually disrupt their oh so perfectness. Advice which relies on me grouping with people I in no way would fit with, is utterly flawed.<br/><br/>On the other hand the e-mail might have been from one of the many thousands of gamers who play with people who are really beyond their acceptance threshold. In which case, yeah, why are you playing with them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158714/#Comment_158714" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T19:17:49+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  7:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 7:18PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, would you actually regularly play with anyone you'd describe as a "bad player?"

I'm proposing a constructive reason why he might say that. I did say it as if it were just my own position, but I suppose I was being careful not to put words in the e-mailers mouth. He might be playing regularly with 'bad players' for roughly the reason I gave. Sorry to phrase it as my own position only - I really meant to address the e-mailers problem and highlight that it's more complex than 'play with good people'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158723/#Comment_158723" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T20:51:13+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  8:51PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hahaha!

They are his scriptures of the most ancient date and therefore of the highest revelation.<br/><br/>"Well," I answered, "the dating of the Vedas has lately been reduced and is being assigned, I believe, to something like, say, 1500 to 1000B.C. As you probably know," I added, "there have been found in India itself the remains of an earlier civilization than the Vedic."<br/><br/>"Yes," said the Indian gentleman, not testily but firmly, with an air of untroubled assurance, "I know; but as an orthodox Hindu I cannot believe that there is anything in the universe earlier than the Vedas."

However: destructive behavior is often based in dysfunctional social frames, and those may spring from a bad game too. If you play with players that are destructive only in the game, then you need to think the game through: is it right for your group?<br/><br/>And as ever in such processes you may end up with answers you don't like. Your friend may be destructive in other situations too, and then you may need to rethink your "friendship": is his/her destructive behaviour really worth putting up with?

He might be expecting this player to do things that the player doesn't find fun.  He might be expecting skilled and experienced behavior from a new player and isn't providing any guidance or support in gaining those skills and experience.  Whatever he is doing, he should probably stop.

Those who enjoy being loud and argumentative, those who pout or act in a childish manner when things go against them, those who use the books as a defense when you rule them out of line should be excluded from the campaign.

However, I and many others have played with tons of total newcomers to gaming-in-general, and have found indie games to be far easier for them to get into than "traditional" games.
