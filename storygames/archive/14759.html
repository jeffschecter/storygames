It's OK if there are exceptions and outliers, but these are things that, if a woman did them, it would be like, WHOA.<br/><br/>I've got:<br/><br/><i>Serve in the Army<br/>Fight Duels<br/>Pursue a suit<br/>Decide the suit of marriagable daughters<br/>Make decisions for the family<br/>Travel freely<br/>Seize political power<br/>Watch their spouse for infidelity<br/>Instruct their spouse</i><br/><br/>What else?<br/><br/>And similarly, I need a list of <b>Things Women Do</b>. These are things that would be unmanful and scandalous if a man did them, or that they simply wouldn't think to do.<br/><br/>I've got:<br/><br/><i>Guard their chastity<br/>Offer comfort and sympathy<br/>Raise children<br/>Tend to the injured<br/>Perform domestic duties<br/>Protest an offered suit<br/>Give advice to a spouse</i><br/><br/>What else?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS It's ok if some of these are contentious; in fact they should be!

That last one is on my list in a different wording. (It's worth noting--and central to my design--that Beatrice orders Claudio's death BECASE as a woman, she can't do it herself.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/><i>Cast spells.<br/>Conduct high-level political negotiations.<br/>Be bawdy.</i></blockquote>\nThese, yes, though I don't they're reserved PARTICULARLY for women. Prospero casts spells, of course, and men are wuite present in politics when politics exists in a play. In fact I'd guess offhand that women negotiating politically would be pretty rare. What examples do you know of women negotiators in Shakespeare?<br/><br/>And <i>everyone</i> is bawdy in Shakespeare, all the time, which is great, and someone like Miss Quickly only stands out as being <i>even more</i> bawdy.<br/><br/>It might do to list out things that both men and women do pretty much equally in Shakespeare.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>Seize political power.<br/>Instruct their spouse.</blockquote>\nThese look pretty dubious to me. When does a woman seize power <i>for herself</i> in Shakespeare? Lady MacBeth seeks power by goading <i>her husband</i> to seize it. Which leads into the other item: I'm trying to differentiate between <i>instructing </i>and <i>advising</i> in the men's and women's lists respectively. There are some domineering women in Shakespeare, sure, but the pattern I see is: Men <i>instruct</i>, because it's their right to call the shots and tell you what's what. Women <i>advise</i>, because the only avenue of influence available is cajoling or pestering. One is authoritative, the other subordinate. A woman breaks free of the subordinate by sheer force of personality, not by any grantyed authority.<br/><br/>Maybe <i>command </i>vs <i>entreat</i>?

Juliet even has a secret midnight wedding so she can bang Romeo.</blockquote>\nAu contraire, women guard their chastity all the time--they're not trying to have sex, they're trying to <i>get married.</i> As noted above, Shakespeare's women are bawdy in the extreme, and many of them seem to approach sex joyfully...but they're always pursuing sex <i>in wedlock.</i><br/><br/>The whole plot of Much Ado About Nothing revolves around hero's virginity. Not only is she shamed at the altar when it looks like she might've slept around, but her dad is ready to disown her when he first hears, and people are only willing to stick up for her if it's not true.<br/><br/>This is not a worry for men in Shakespeare. Being cuckolded is. Which is again, about the promiscuity of the woman.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite><br/>- I don't see a lot of child-raising in Shakespeare mostly because there are not a lot of children in the plays.  I guess it happens off-stage, but you don't see a lot of it being done.  Even when there are children (young princes in Richard III), they're generally not being mothered or nursed all the time.</blockquote>\nYou're right, I was more extrapolating from the general culture than thinking of any particular events in Shakespeare's plays. It does seem to be an implicit thing whenever children DO come up, though: women are caretakers, not men. It's always a mother or a nursemaid who watches over (or worries over) a child. Men, even when they're devoted fathers, have weightier matters to attend. MacDuff's family in MacBeth is a great example. He's away doing political stuff, his wife's watching the kids, and his whole family gets slaughtered.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I think it's mainly the comedies that concern me, since that's where the convention of reverting to status quo is strongest. In a tragedy, the act of subversion or rebellion IS carried to a catastrophic conclusion. I'm looking more at the plays that go like "oh, you're a woman dressed as a man, how cute, let's get you back into a dress so you can marry the Duke, shall we? Great, now everybody's happy!" I want to turn that on its head.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are some compelling characters in the Tragedies, like the Lady MacBeth as Roger points out.
