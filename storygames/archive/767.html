                    So, I was thinking about the "What is your Go-To-Game (for design reference)" game, which I added to.<br/><br/>Currently, I've written a single joke RPG that is approx 1 page long. <br/>I've participated in Game Chef and have a 40-page currently-unplayable game (which I intend to fix up in the next two years).<br/>I'm translating a game from Japanese into English, but I'm certainly not designing it. I'm adding to it, and editing it, but certainly not designing.<br/><br/>Other than that, I've got some ideas for games that will take up a couple dozen pages, that are more-or-less in the works now (that is, I throw a little bit more words at the document every few days or so). <br/><br/>I don't really feel like a designer, though I think a lot about the process of designng games. And if you look online or to RPG creation groups, you'll see a lot of people who introduce themselves as "game designers" even though they have never released anything, and are perpetually working on/talking about a game that is probably unwritten...<br/><br/>So what is that dividing line for you?  For you, what does a person have to do/accomplish/publish/etc to be an "RPG designer"?<br/><br/>Do they have to have published their games for money? Does for free count? <br/>Do they have to work for an RPG company?<br/>Are you a designer if you cranked out a 24 Hour RPG, Ronnie or Game Chef game?<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>For me, I've got kind of a blend, or "range" of "How much I think someone is an RPG Designer".<br/><br/>If someone has themselves put together a game, no matter how shitty it was, and sold it either in hard or soft copy, and sold, say, like 50 copies, then I consider them a "True RPG Designer". Exceptions are sometimes made for folks who publish free a fuckload of their work, like Simon Washborne or Marco Chacon.<br/><br/>If someone has only published stuff online from their website/wiki/blog/etc and the like for free, they kinda fall into a second category for me, like an "enthusiastic hobbyist". But that's at the same level to me as someone who publishes some excellent house rules for D&amp;D online.<br/><br/>If someone hasn't released anything complete of their own (ie folks who call themselves "RPG Designers" who haven't actually published yet, and haven't done any side-works and the like), I don't consider them an RPG Designer. This includes folks who have done the Game Chef, 24 Hour RPG or Ronnie or whatever, but haven't gone back to finish and publish their title. Like Me!<br/><br/>If someone writes for a 'large' or 'established' RPG company and have their name in the credits to a large release, then I'm mixed: If someone can say, "This system here, I designed with my own hands and playtested it", then I consider them an "RPG Designer". Otherwise, they mostly fall into the "RPG Writer" category (writing world fiction, etc: A noble and difficult craft, don't get me wrong, but it's not designing).<br/><br/>You?                </div>

                            Hey, :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a very black-and-white kind of guy. So, I give myself two very black-and-white answers for this, depending on what you mean by "label".<br/>
<br/>
If you mean it as something you do, then the minute you consider the idea of tweaking a rule, you are "designing" in some way, and you immediately get to call yourself a game deisgner.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean it as something you are, then you need to have something with your name on it published, whether for free or for sale. House rules or hacks don't count, but full-fledged expansions do.* Also, game design documents don't count either, which is why I'm not there yet... :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<p><code>So what is that dividing line for you? For you, what does a person have to do/accomplish/publish/etc to be an "RPG designer"?</code></p>
<p>Well, if someone else wants to say "I am a game designer," that's cool with me.  I'll go along with it.  Also if they want to say  "I am a man," or "I am a feminist," or "I am a superhero," all of those are totally cool with me.</p>
<p>I know this'll sound like a diatribe of some sort, but it's genuinely just confusion:  I've never quite understood the desire to 'defend the categories' by telling people "No, you <em>aren't</em> a man/feminist/superhero because of X, Y and Z."</p>
<p>I suspect that it's like in some roleplaying games, if somebody declares "Man, that scene <em>totally</em> rocked my world!  My character no longer has his fear of spiders now!" and the scene was, like, he got up and ate a hot dog ... that's cool.  He's not telling me something about reality, he's telling me something about himself  Same thing.  He's never designed or even played a game, but he's a game designer?  Cool.  That's an interesting insight into the person.</p>
<p>To give you an insight into me, I think that the moment I went from not being a game designer to being one was a Forge-moment.  I'd come in looking for advice on Amber, and on how to refine my craft, and a whole bunch of people pointed out that my craft was influenced by the system I was operating under, and showed me a whole lot of different rules and how they influenced things ... and somewhere in there I realized "Oh!  You can <em>make a system</em> in a way that's not just the same-old-same-old, but which is designed to do something entirely different."  For me, realizing the purpose of the exercise changed my perception of everything from that point forward, so even before I started designing a game I was looking at it from the point of view of a game designer.</p>
<p>But there are people who have not had that epihpany and who define themselves as game designers, and they're right too, for their own reasons.</p>

<p>Game designer? No. Yes. I mean, to the extent that anyone who "runs" these games fiddles, adjusts, and ultimately <em>implements</em> them as necessary, sure. It's by that definition I'll say that Forge theory is only of interest to game designers, and nobody else should worry about it.</p>
<p>But going around calling myself a game designer? Man, that seems to me rather like people you run into at parties or wherever who identify themselves with "I'm an artist," which translates to "I wait tables until my hobby produces something somebody else is actually interested in, but really, I'm very hip." Yuck.</p>
<p>Having something you've released which you can honestly pass off as your own, and not a mere ripoff/tweak of someone else's work is probably a good benchmark. The corollary being, if you release a little one-sheet on the internet, but everyone goes "Wow! That's brilliant! I'll totally steal those ideas for my game!" (I'm thinking of The Pool here) I think you gotta get props as a game designer as well.</p>

<br/>
BUT<br/>
<br/>
For me, personally, I need the definition of game designer is simply "someone who designs games."  Specifically, it isn't someone who "thinks about maybe designing a game someday."  I'm drawing this out of writing, where lots of people want to be writers, but don't actually write.  For instance, a month ago I was a writer, because I was regularly writing and finishing stories.  Today, I am not, 'cause I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
This definition is really easy for me because designing and finishing is hard, and it would be very easy to stop doing the hard part and just grab to the identity label.<br/>

  I think you need to gain at least 1 XP from using your Design Game skill in order to get your Game Design legend... But you need to gain 6 lvls before you get the Game Designer Prestige Class!<br/>

                            I was a game designer long befor I designed a game, in the same way that I declared myself a linguistics Major on the sign in sheet for my first linguistics class.<br/><br/>My modus operendi is to decide I want to do something do it badley then go back and hate myself for doing it badly now that I know how to do it right. <br/><br/>I am trying, slowly to break this habit. I have actually been playing games and think that I have answers to some of the things I know are bad about my games.<br/><br/>I am a game designer and I will be a better game designer but I don't think I will ever be a really good game designer.                        </div>

<blockquote>You are a game designer when you design a game. Period.</blockquote>
That's not a useful... anything. That's just a tautology and it's complicated by the necessary semantic argument and definition of terms. Is that thing you created a "game"? Did you "design" it?<br/><br/>I think there are two acceptable answers.<br/><br/>One, you're a game designer when you think you are. Fine. But we don't have to agree with you.<br/><br/>Two, you're a game designer when people generally think you are. Social categorization is done by general consensus, sorta. When people start treating you like a game designer, then you are one, because the definition is based on public opinion.  <br/><br/>When is that?  When does the public seem to consider someone a game designer? I think that's what Andy's asking.                        </div>

                            I beat my head on this one some, but I have settled on accepting that I'm _just barely_ a game designer, so I guess I don't consider the cusp to be too far past "free PDF" in terms of publishing limits if only because there's a lot of potential range within that.<br/>
<br/>
When Spirt of the Century gets out of editing and onto the page, I'll probably feel a lot less tenuous.<br/>
<br/>
So bottom line, I'm all for a pretty generous interpretation that depends on two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) You create a game<br/>
2) Someone plays it (and ideally, would be willing to play it again)<br/>
<br/>
I guess #2 is the only tricky part, since it probably rules out some 24-hour/gamechef/intellectual exercise games which may be quite good.  Of course, I can't feel it's too exclusionary, because if the guy who wrote it wants to run it, that's good enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, I think Mike Gentry's Timecube RPG is brilliantly funny, but if it were the only thing he'd ever written, I wouldn't consider him a game designer because it's really not for playing (of course, he has written other things, and I do consider him one, but there it is).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the rub of this is that having said that, I want a better word for Andy.  I mean, hell, I am content calling Andy a Game Designer, a Game Poobah, or even a Most Excellent Game Dude because, frankly, what do you call someone who has made his level of pure _contribution_?  I'm a little edgy about the whole terminology thing because, man, being a GD is interesting, but it ain't no badge of honor, and I worry about it being treated as such.<br/>
<br/>
But hell, maybe I worry too much.<br/>

You're just saying them from the opposite side and working towards the middle. <br/><br/>Oh, and Tony is saying something that's towards the middle from the inside out, rather than the outside in, perspective. Interesting how that happens, isn't it? How community, individual, and self definition all slide down a slope into a common pool?<br/><br/>And I, btw, pretty much agree with all of you.

At least in my opinion.<br/><br/>A designer is someone who makes a living designing games. This implies that you may have designed several.

                            No, I think that Robin Laws is a designer, as are Sandy Petersen, Steve Long, Steve Jackson, and a lot of others. <br/><br/>My point, and I guess it was lost in my attempt to be circumspect, is that any meaningful discussion has to break down to empirical evidence. Any empirical evidence leaves very few of us as game designers. Following that, I will never feel like a game designer unless I make a living designing games.                        </div>

                            Uncertain what you mean by empirical evidence.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the data is reasonably accessable, and the question is one of definitions.  I mean, I don't agree with the "make a living at it" line, but it is, at the very least, quite clear.  And given that rule, it's not too hard to say who's in and who's out.  Similarly clear rules are equally workable, save only that they create disagreement.  Hell, Vincent's rule's pretty clear too. :)<br/>

                            Tautology my pasty white behind. You didn't ask me to define a game, you asked me to define a "game designer". I figured you already knew what a game was. Why would you ask me what a game designer was if you were still wandering about out in left field talking to the clouds and thinking about what a game is?<br/>
<br/>
Members of teams that design games are also game designers. What are they doing if they're not designing games?<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to make a living at designing games to be a game designer. I am a book collector but it's not my living.                        </div>

<p>I think Ross' definition is nonsense. Am I a painter only if I make a living painting? Cuz I know a lot of people who paint all the time but aren't painters, by that  principle.</p>
<p>Me, I think identity is a stupid place to put this. I prefer verbs to nouns, myself. I design games. I play games. I design books. I build airplanes. I play with kittens. See? It's a statement of empirical fact. You could come to my house and see the games, books, wreckage, and cat shit everywhere.</p>
<p>"I am a feminist" is a way to identify yourself to others in shorthand, but it doesn't say much about what you do. And what you do is much more important than the "Hello my name is" tags you can slap on your unthreatening sweater. "I teach business classes to women" is a much more powerful statement than "I'm a Feminist". "I love my partner Bill" is much more telling than "I'm gay." "I fight crime in a costume using my powers of psoriasis," is more truthful than "I'm a superhero".</p>
<p>If I meet someone who says "I want to be called a picklecobbler, I'll call them what they want. But I'm much less interested in that than I am in their picklecobbling skills.</p>
<p>I don't care if I'm referred to as a game designer. But if you say I don't design games, you'll have some explaining to do.</p>
<p>Postscript: there are a lot of folks I hang around with where it's important to me on a visceral level that I be seen as "one of us" because I love them so much. That doesn't make it any less lame to say that I'm a game designer to hang out with them.</p>

                            Hey all, no need to state claims on others' definitions. I was just probing what, personally, people's definition of X was. We're not going to hit an empirical definiton, so there's no use debating over which definitions are right or not, any more than asking people what their favorite food is.<br/><br/>It's just a thread of people stating: "I believe that X is Y for Z reasons", and the rest nodding sagely and saying, "Hmmm, it's interesting that that person thinks so". Nothing really deeper than that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I don't really feel the need to argue with other people's definitions, because I think y'all are saying smart, reasonable things, even if you're coming from a few different points of view.<br/><br/>For me, personally, I make a distinction between being a game designer and being a professional game designer.  You can totally be a game designer even if you've never formally published anything or worked on a publication-oriented project (which caveat I add because of all the great designers I know in the computer game industry who've had their projects killed), and for what it takes to "be a game designer" I'd agree with the consensus that seems to be emerging. <br/><br/>To be a professional game designer, though, I think is a bit harder.  Either you have to make money off your work, or you have to be doing your work with an expectation of making money (either now or someday), or you have to in some other way treat it professionally - otherwise it's not your profession.  A lawyer who volunteers as a paramedic is still a lawyer, professionally, and I think the same argument goes with game design.  Of course, most of us can't afford to make our whole living off of making games, but it's an attitude/expectation thing.<br/><br/>To bring this back to specifics, I am a professional game designer.  I used to support myself full-time making and consulting about mostly-non-roleplaying games, and even now that I'm back in grad school I still do a fair bit of paid, professional work.  While I don't intend to make a living directly off my role-playing games (because, well, ha!), I do expect that it will contribute materially to my game design skills, and to helping me better understand and perform the research that will make me an academic success and therefore lead to my becoming a professor, etc. etc.  This may sound cynical, but I have to think about how I want to be working in this field in five years, and that means taking my design practice very, very seriously, and thinking about how it can help me professionally in the long term.  I <i>also</i> love designing role-playing games - but when I think about it in a professional context, loving it is not the point.<br/><br/>I'm <i>also</i> a game design volunteer, with the various work I do with kids and women and all that.  That's not something I have an expectation of helping me professionally; I do it because it matters to me.  I suspect for many people, the design they do falls into this category - avocation, not vocation - not because the work is less professional, but because there's no real expectation about the outcome.<br/><br/>So, on to the sage head-nodding, or the ritual kicking of the ritual butt.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

How about I call myself a game bricoleur at the moment?  I'm gathering all these nifty bits and pieces and seeing how I can cobble them together...it feels very much like I have this room in the back where I go and tinker.  It's got all these bits and pieces laying around, maybe a few broken down clocks or motors, more or less disparate, from which I make little mechanical gizmos.  Every once in a while, I pull one out, stick it in my sack, go visit some friends, and show them off.  Nothing grand, but it gives me a nice parallel track for my thoughts.                        </div>

                            I'll throw my weight behind Joshua's statements as well. Actions better define what a person is. I prefer to tell people I compose music, I'm writing short stories, I'm designing a game. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you do need the noun though, if only because people expect it. I compose music but have business cards that say "composer." It's a weaker statement, but in some contexts, that's all you're allowed.<br/>
<br/>
For me the question is "do I feel comfortable calling myself a game designer?" Certainly not. But since music is my first love, one day I may call myself "A Composer."                        </div>

<p>Here's some sage headnodding:</p>
<p>I think Jess is right about the specificity of "professionalism". It's another fact: do you make money doing something? Enough that you'd miss it if it wasn't there? You're professional. That's where I'm at.</p>
<p>Mearls is obviously a professional game designer (and a decent person, to boot), as is Jared. Where the question gets interesting is in cases like Ben's and Vincent's, where they both make a significant percentage of their incomes from games, but do other things, too.</p>
<p>I think I draw the line at effectiveness. If you've made a game all the way: from conception to public acceptance, dealing with playtesting, printing issues, getting a PDF workflow that functions, and so one, then you've designed a game. (Of course, you don't have to do all these things yourself; you just have to confront the issues)</p>
<p>You can't say you're biking if you're just pumping up your tires. You could say that you're biking over to Northampton while you're on your bike, but unless you know what's involved from experience,  that's an optimistic appraisal. It could turn out to be much harder than you thought.</p>
