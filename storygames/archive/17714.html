Always ask questions!" when thinking about the readers of my game. I took a step back and realised that what I really meant was that I wanted to make them think. Examples can block the mind. What you want to show is perfectly clear as long as it's within the example itself. We can take the <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=119" rel="nofollow">blog entry about fruitful void</a>. Everybody gets it, but as soon as they step outside the example (Dogs in the Vineyard) it's hard to grasp, because the whole explanation in that entry is based on Dogs in the Vineyard. Think about it for a while. What other example can you give of the fruitful void? Examples does almost the same thing as writing a definition about what it's not. OK, it's not an apple but can it than be an orange? A pear? A car?<br/><br/>Games that are played with a group are strange to write, because you need to explain how to explain the game. It's possible to handle any possible situation if you create a really focused game - "This game is about catching a monkey in a scrapyard." - but when your game can create several stories it's more about giving general guidelines that the reader can use for different situations. Something I realized when I read "Always ask questions" is that it's a guideline I use all the time when I'm leading a game. A guideline to create creative players. A guideline to make them think.<br/><br/>But asking questions can't surely be the only solution to make my players think. I've playing roleplaying games for 25 years and asking questions was something I picked up during the last years. So I started to think about how I could make my players think. This is what I've come up with so far. Before you read on, think of some of the tricks that you do and be sure to write them in this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Ask questions.<br/>- Create a problem.<br/>- Build on established facts. For example, making the players connect two things.<br/>- Give guidelines.<br/>- Draw from their experiences. Make them mix their experience with yours.<br/><br/>If we now go back to writing a game, you can do the same thing to make the reader think. I wonder what else I can use.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401247/#Comment_401247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-19T13:04:28+00:00" title="December 19, 2012  1:04PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2012 1:05PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd state it more like "Create a problem... <i>but NOT a solution</i>" just for the sake of keeping future GMs with the idea that it's up to the players to come up with those solutions.<br/><br/>Most of the tricks I use fall between those three.

Did you have anything else in mind when you wrote that? I'm editing my original post.<br/><br/>It was an interesting read to read about The Six Thinking Hats. I started to think about roleplaying sessions while reading that. How you make, in an investigator scenario, make the players to first put on a white (facts) hat and then a black (criticizing) hat. How you in a horror game make the players to put on red (emotional) hats. It's interesting to read that the hats should just be put on for a minute (half a minute with a red one). Especially when it comes to the red hat; if you're watching a sitcom with great jokes for 23 minutes, you wont laugh all the time. Instead, you will equalize and bring the bar up. It's important to have a rollercoaster of emotions, otherwise you get used to the it and the effect will largely decrease.<br/><br/>So your suggestion is to make the players/readers put on different hats?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hannah" title="Hannah"><img alt="Hannah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hannah">Hannah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401312/#Comment_401312" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T10:13:50+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 10:13AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems like an interesting line of thought, but I'm not sure I fully understand where you're going with it yet. Are you arguing against ever using examples, in game texts or at the table? If so, I'd have to disagree. Examples are an application of "show, don't tell." And there's a reason we like to follow that principle: it's because our brains are better at understanding stories and images than abstract ideas. I agree that overly heavy-handed or misapplied examples have the potential to get in the way of creativity, but by and large I think it's the opposite. I think simple, well-placed examples are key to getting people past their confusion and on with being creative. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401316/#Comment_401316" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T10:35:34+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 10:35AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 7:04AM by Rickard.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Lets say that you really need to come up with a name to a character in a fantasy RPG.

Guidelines don't make you think, but they will steer you in the right direction when you need to think. It's just not short sentences that can work as guidelines, but the setting itself (read: the genre) can make you think in a certain way. You will probably describe the environment different if the setting is Sci-Fi or post-apocalypse.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When I read the GM chapter in The Spirit of Yesterday, it didn't seem like anything special. It wasn't until I read the chapter again and during that time compared everything I read to my own experience from gaming sessions. It wasn't until then I realised that whoever wrote that chapter, that person (those persons) have really thought about what roleplaying games are. So nowadays, when I really want to learn something, I always try to compare it to my own experience. It helps me remember what I just read as well as pointing out how I can use the information. Writing in this way - to get the reader to compare to it's own experiences - is really tricky. I don't have any idea on how to do that. Can you recall a moment when you started to compare the text with your experience?

I'm saying that the writer/reader dependence is the same thing as the GM/player dependence.<br/><br/>When it comes to examples, I do think it's OK to use examples in text to, as you say, make the abstract to be concrete. But I think it's totally destructive at the table. Perhaps we're thinking about different situations. When I say that you should ask questions rather than give examples, I think of situations where the player is put into a problem that need to be solved with a declared number of tools. Like, breaking into a house, using different skills, or making the guard eat the poison, using the player's verbal ability.<br/><br/>To give an example of how to achieve the character's goal is taking away that option. "Are you really that lame that you have to use another person's idea?". So instead of giving an example of how to solve the situation - "Put the poison into a biscuit" - you may instead ask "How can you make the guard eat the poison?". Or in some cases even ask a really leading question: "Can you use a biscuit?". Even if you actually told with your question how to solve the situation, you still leave it up to the player to decide what to do.<br/><br/>And like I said: in written text, examples can be of good use.

I think we were talking about different kinds of games. I was thinking of very open-ended, GM-less story games like Fiasco, Polaris, Dog Eat Dog, etc. where players can always do anything simply by stating that they do it. From what you wrote above, it sounds like you're thinking of games where players' options are more restricted.<br/><br/>I find that in the kinds of games I'm referring to, new players coming from "traditional" RPG backgrounds in particular can sometimes be overwhelmed by the infinite possibility. For these players, having a handful of wide-ranging and simple examples of "the types of things that you might do in this game" can be really helpful and anxiety-reducing, as long as they understand that those examples are only a starting point. <br/><br/>In open-ended games, examples are also useful for introducing the themes and flavor of a given game. This is an important part of what the Tilt tables do in Fiasco: they give examples of "the kinds of things that happen in this game," which helps players understand the genre of the story they will be telling. Is this the kind of story where there are frantic chases (hard Tilt), or the kind where there are magical moments in soft focus (soft Tilt)? That's one reason why we need more Tilt tables, so that Fiasco can be used to tell stories in a wider genre range.... but that's another post for later. <br/><br/>These kinds of examples are probably best introduced while pitching the game, or while introducing a specific rule or mechanic, rather than in response to a creative block during a scene. I often see examples/suggestions used to help with creative blocks in GM-less games, but there's a specific social contract around it. If someone feels stuck for an idea, everyone is  usually free to jump in with various suggestions, but everyone understands that these can be taken, left, or modified with no judgement or hard feelings, and that the player making the decision has the final say. I generally think this is fun and keeps the game moving, and I haven't seen it create social difficulty or make someone feel stupid. I think it's just the best when I'm floundering, and a new player trying her first RPG ever comes up with a brilliant new direction for me. <br/><br/>Maybe examples take on a different tone when playing a more open-ended game where everyone at the table has equal narrative authority?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401367/#Comment_401367" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T19:01:22+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  7:01PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2012 7:04PM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ah, this makes more sense now.

(not sure that's the right term, maybe give a bonus) if they solve the scene in that way. <br/>Your quote below uses questions to get the players thinking. Examples as you have pointed out reduce the options and take ownership away from the player.\n<blockquote>I wrote in another thread "Never give examples. Always ask questions!" .</blockquote>\nSo if a player was stuck for a solution and all other methods were exhausted (Questions etc).

In a world where only royalty may wear purple, the fact that our goblin wears a purple tunic is going to shape the fiction that will follow. Perhaps you will not be so eager to reduce his hit points for fear of retaliation. Perhaps you feel obligated to show him your trousers. Maybe you think him an imposter. Maybe you will remain ignorant of the importance of the purple tunic at the moment of your meeting, and will pay the price later in the game.

It all started when I was writing on a roleplaying game that made the characters succeed all the time.

It's just a piece of plastic that they throw.<br/>Over the years, these methods had come to form a theory about how to engage the players.

I read that post back then and tuned right in, thinking this is new and different, it might not be for some? but its new for me.<br/>Your idea is personal and engages player to GM by asking questions. <br/>These <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17740/itras-by-chance-cards-as-gm#Item_6" rel="nofollow">cards</a> in this post engage the players to think through a medium which are very clever by the way.<br/>AW has moves which engage the player depending on dice outcome.<br/>Lateral thinking? I think is a personal endeavor more a self improvement method.
