And I've been meaning to blog more, but for the moment I'm working around 50+ hours a week, and no one pays me to blog (or to do Master Plan).<br/><br/>I wouldn't say I'm aggressively playtesting Mythender anymore. But I have decided that all games are in development up until you submit it to the printer. And I do occasionally bring it out, partly to remind myself how it works. (I let it sit since January, and played two games of it last month at GPNW and Origins. That turns out to be awesome, because the last of the "unsolvable" problems were solve by reexamining the game from a distance.)<br/><br/>Christian St. Pierre and I have been talking off and on. We're both *very* interested in working together, but we haven't committed yet because I need the text more or less done so I know what I need art for. I like him, we have a rapport, and I like his line art style. He does good horror fantasy, and I think he can bring what I want to Mythender. And I'll be working with Daniel Solis for layout. Wait, I'm sorry, I mean Daniel Fucking Solis.<br/><br/>What's left to do? Writing the damned thing. Butt-in-chair. Then first round editing, then beta playtesting. I want to make sure the text is usable by others. I have had 70 people play Mythender is various states, which has helped me refine the math, the conceit, the language choices, the way I explain things at the table, etc. but that's useless if I fuck it up in the book.<br/><br/>How can you help? I'll be mouthy about getting beta playtesters, when the time comes. And it seems that harassment is working to remind me people want it. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The usual? In the morning, a vanilla latte with no foam. In the evening, a Manhattan.<br/><br/>Wait, you didn't mean that.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give a release date, because it's not done enough to where I can see the future. Working with others means meshing schedules, so I can't just declare when I'm going to have it ready. I'd *like* to have it out by next con season. We'll see. But I totally am keen to finish it. I want to show the world my little epic fantasy story game that uses more dice than your mother.<br/><br/>I'll answer more later, but I'm swamped with work right now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks! \\m/<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280126/#Comment_280126" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T12:11:27+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 12:11PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kobayashi</cite>Ok, sorry about the bad pun</blockquote>\nWRONG.<br/><br/>You have forged the best pun on all of the internets.<br/><br/>Ryan: i have a hilarious (different) word-play deviation of Mythender to make up, as soon as you have a playable version of the game.<br/>Likely it won't be as sweet by half as ME is, but that has never stopped me.<br/><br/>C'mon, killers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280173/#Comment_280173" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T14:44:52+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  2:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2010 2:45PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>Ryan: i have a hilarious (different) word-play deviation of Mythender to make up, as soon as you have a playable version of the game.</blockquote>\nIf it's playing as the Build Team from Mythbusters, Carl Rigney came up with that idea many moons ago. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>And Sophie's misreading of "My Thender" has left me figuring out what a Thender is, to stat it up for the game.

So, you have an army of \xdcbermenschen who have conquered the world. You're part of a ragtag underground who has realized that the way to return freedom to the world isn't to build a *safe* serum like the Axis has, but one that can overpower.<br/><br/>Or, it's about how the line between being Captain America (hero of a people) and being the Hulk (a source of fear and justification for the conquering Axis that has sworn to purge you). I have a few notes down about how the game changes as this scale, but that's as far as I'm allowing myself before Mythender itself is done. Still, just saying that to say "yes, we're all about the wordplay on Team Mythender!"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 14thWarrior</cite>Would kidnapping you and holding you prisoner in a remote cabin, Misery style, help you get Mythender done any sooner?</blockquote>\nNope, but doing that to others and signing over their paychecks to me would!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cathrak</cite>What kind of art will you use?</blockquote>\nThat's something that Team Mythender needs to talk about in depth. I have a vision right now, but I don't want to get into detail because I assume the vision will only get better as the Team talks.<br/><br/>That, and there are some financial logistics involved in what we're likely planning, so I don't want to get hopes up if it turns out non-feasible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Will the boxed set include lightning tokens made of Zocchi plastic, sharp enough to shave mighty Achilles?</blockquote>\nMany of is keep joking that we need to do a box set edition that has the 150 or so dice you need, the lighting tokens, the might tokens, and all that. Because if there's one thing gamers totally want, it's to pay a crapton for shipping of stuff they already own. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Can I run it with GURPS? I really like GURPS.</blockquote>\nIf you asked me earlier, yes. But someone already Ended the concept of GURPS. Sorry.<br/>(Also, man, you don't even want to get me started on GURPS. I loved the hell of out my GURPS 3/e &amp; 4/e stuff.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>Will it help me find the woman of my dreams? I buried her in this one place, but I lost the map.....</blockquote>\nSadly, no. But don't despair! Instead, you can:<br/>* End the concept of dream women<br/>* End the concept of being buried<br/>* End the concept of needing maps<br/>etc.<br/>So, it's like the whole "give a man a fish/teach a man to End the fuck out of concepts that inconvenience him" sort of thing.<br/><br/>This has been fun!

F*** yeah!!!<br/><br/>I have to say I have been craving to play it for a long while, since I first heard about it (an AP at Story-Games, if I recall correctly). Come on! I even have my very own project heavily influenced by Mythender by now!<br/><br/>So, yeah. It's not even final and the game already has fans in Mexico.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
