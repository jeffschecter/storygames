Whether the two are related or not - I'm not talking about if you play a fighter you should be able to swing a longsword around though. <br/><br/>For example: making a thief solve a jigsaw puzzle or rubix cube in order to pick a lock, have a wizard say a tongue twister in order to cast a spell beyond his level, etc. <br/><br/>There are some games that do have that other element I assume, though I can only really think of Dread at the moment. Mostly because I'm making an RPG designed for language learning and is, at its core, designed to run on player skill for all resolution mechanics, I was wondering how people would respond to such a thing. Obviously playing jenga doesn't require a particularly high level of skill, but the idea of tying useful player skills (learned out of game) with resolution mechanics or benefits in-game is really interesting to me.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381840/#Comment_381840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T05:47:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  5:47AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I'm playing D&amp;D at the moment is pretty much all about player skill, or more accurately it's about the players' mastery of a specific set of D&amp;D-related skills, most of which are about careful interaction with the fictional world. <br/><br/>Sometimes there's more direct challenges, like straight-up puzzles for the players to solve, but I'm kind of leery of that style of play.

Naturally, this is a <i>big</i> issue in larp: whether a player's affordances match up with their abilities, and whether or not the affective substitute (a tense side puzzle) breaks engagement with the original (the devious trap).<br/><br/>In Ville Vuorela's totally diceless RPG <i><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/ville-vuorela/stalker-rpg/paperback/product-20046636.html" rel="nofollow">Stalker</a></i>, the player's <i>idea</i> for "solving" a situation is qualitatively evaluated by the GM: they just decide if what you came up with was clever enough to take on the challenge. I don't know how this system would measure up (in terms of tension) against a system like <i>Dread</i>, but it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does</span> represent what I do in real life for a job \u2013 namely, evaluate folks' success based on their ideas and their rhetorical defense of them...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381893/#Comment_381893" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T12:58:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 12:58PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When it comes to players needing to do things that relate <i>abstractly</i> to what their characters are doing, I think it's kind to provide some kind of "hint" mechanics. For instance, I recently played a D&amp;D game where the PCs had to solve a puzzle to unlock a door before they were overwhelmed by zombies. The DM gave us a literal puzzle, bought from a toys &amp; games store. Fortunately, the puzzle was designed to have several difficulty levels, so every time we succeeded on a relevant skill check (Arcana, Thievery, Dungeoneering), the DM took away a piece of the puzzle and let us solve it for a lower difficulty level. There are specifics I'd do differently in retrospect if I were running such a thing itself (like telling players the <i>rules</i> for the puzzle for their first successful skill check), but overall I thought it was an extremely clever approach.<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to players needing to do things that relate <i>directly and literally</i> to what their characters are doing, I think that's only really fair if you're talking about (a) skills you can reasonably exercise at the table, and (b) skills <i>players</i> wouldn't mind learning themselves. This is why I don't feel guilty requiring players to verbally role-play the details of social skills, like bluffing and trying to persuade NPCs. Some players aren't as good at this as their PCs are, so you sometimes get the group's master diplomat stammering something awkwardly instead of using that silver tongue of his. There's a moment of narrative dissonance, sure, but it can be worth it in the long run \u2013\xa0both for the players themselves and the rest of the group \u2013\xa0to suffer through this early on. Public speaking, improvisational thinking, and creative storytelling are all excellent skills to have in general, and giving players a chance to practice these skills at the table makes our games better. <br/><br/>I think the OP's game for building language skills is a good example: Anybody can safely practice a new language at the table (unlike, say, learning to swing a broadsword), and that's actually a skill plenty of players would probably find desirable to practice. I think it might also be kind to have a "hint" mechanic here, too, like allowing players to spend an extra "character point" or "mana point" (or whatever) to look up something in their dictionary every now and then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381897/#Comment_381897" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T13:19:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  1:19PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you checked out Mansions of madness <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83330/mansions-of-madness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83330/mansions-of-madness</a> <br/>I have played this game, it uses just what your talking about, Puzzles for sure.

In my system the ONLY reason "rolls" exist is for GMs, not players--so that GMs can have a particular style of challenge without having to physically build one or without putting players at risk.<br/><br/>So, actually, my examples would be the OPPOSITE of some of the above:<br/>* Have an "Int check" when the GMs don't have the time or money to make an actual puzzle.<br/>* Have a "Dex check" to cross a tightrope which is actually just laying on the ground, because of falling concerns.<br/>* Have a "Con check" to simulate disgusting or poisonous odors (the former is not desired by many hosts, the latter is obviously dangerous).<br/><br/>And, from time to time:<br/>* Have a "Courage check" to go into a 'scary place' (when, let's be honest, it's VERY hard to make a set actually scary, due to budget and disbelief suspension limitations).<br/><br/>Does this tend to mean that you can't be a "smart guy" if you aren't actually smart? Yep. You can't be a "good fighter" if you can't handle a weapon worth a damn? Nope.<br/><br/>TL; DR: Everything is done with actual player skill, when not dangerous, impossible, or too expensive to simulate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381908/#Comment_381908" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T15:00:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  3:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Plus, since it's introduced in an abstract game, it's hardcore railroading at it's finest.

Personally, though, I'm generally in favor of trying out ANYTHING that encourages players to creatively engage with a game in ways other than just rolling dice over and over.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381909/#Comment_381909" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T15:14:50+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  3:14PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some things are essentially based off player skill in most tabletops, too. Persuasion, puzzle-solving, tactics - they're rarely rolled for (and even in games where these things can be rolled, the GM will usually let the player succeed if they make a persuasive argument, solve the puzzle or come up with a cunning plan OOC). So in a way it seems odd that exceptions are made for things like swinging a sword. Why? Basically, because your average geek can't swing a sword, I guess.<br/><br/>But take a game like Apocalypse World, now the above things are mostly mechanised. Persuasion requires a roll, and cannot be done at all without one.<br/><br/>But anyway, to answer the question I'm not a big fan of making players complete challenges to pick locks or whatever, outside of LRP. It's not why I roleplay, it gives an unfair advantage to smarter people and unless it is exactly mirroring what the character is doing it breaks, rather than enhances suspension if disbelief.<br/><br/>LRP is different; you need to stretch a small GM team over numerous players scattered through a large site. Using mechanics for this is impractical, and breaks an otherwise immersive game down into a mini-tabletop. But I'd still prefer the task to be as close a copy to the one the character is completing as possible, for reasons of belief suspension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381914/#Comment_381914" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T15:30:55+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  3:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Seriously?

I wrote what I wrote because all of those examples were forced onto the players without a hint they were going to do that sort of stuff. I've used many props for puzzles in my game sessions that don't detract from the style of game and I at least hint to the players they are going to be trying some actual puzzles instead of rolling for success against a puzzle.<br/><br/>My favorite was using a 'Where's Waldo?' book as a test to catch their person of interest. The first player to spot him narrated the scene and the longer it took, the farther away he would get in the chase chart (it's called something like that for Warhammer Fantasy 3rd Edition). Not against puzzles in general, as long as people are aware those kinds of puzzles will be in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381961/#Comment_381961" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T19:47:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  7:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2012 8:24PM by kksimons.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Noofy">@Noofy</a>: Very cool!

It's not a surprise challenge or something, it's what they'll be doing the entire game. I keep flip-flopping in regards to social situations in games. On one hand, it's one of the best skills you can learn but, on the other, the player chose to be this character for a reason - we usually handle it in the same way you do. In D&amp;D I actually had them roll such skills first so that they could roleplay the result - how well it turned out. A couple lines relating to the result usually takes place and we go on from there. As for language learning there are a couple approaches I'm thinking of. The teacher in me wants to have dictionaries and resources available to the players at all times - after all, the game is about language learning so why limit that, right? But there's the matter of it being a game as well, and imposing limitations inspire creativity as well.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul88">@Paul88</a>: I think a mix of the two is definitely a sweet spot along with, as Jason T said, knowing what kind of challenges you want to impose and, like Alex Swingle said, being up front with the players, knowing what they game for and what is fun for them.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a> Artman: I can see that working for a LARP but I can also see that being a real ton of work.

Low level spells only require a verb and a noun which the player chooses to best suit the context and intent of the spell whereas high level spells require a complete sentence and depending on what kind of spell it is different grammar patterns are used.

If you're telling me, "This is a straight boffer larp, and your skill is your character's skill", I'm fine with that. It's not my thing, but that's okay.<br/><br/>However, there was one larp which had several issues. One of these had to do with the gun battle system. All of the PCs had a stat for that, ranging from 1-5. 5 was best, and these stats were visible on the badges on the grounds that this was a Wild West-related genre, and people could tell from how one moved how good one was with a gun. So far, so good.<br/><br/>My character's skill was 4, really good, but not the best. But, the rule for the gun battles was: "Shoot with the nerf gun. If you hit with the nerf gun, you hit. If you miss with the nerf gun, you miss."<br/><br/>So, my personal skill, not my character's? That's a 1. There was a gun battle my character was supposed to be in, and (for reasons that made no sense at the time, but did make some sense afterwards), the player running it decided to have a qualifying round. There was a large block on the ground. There was a line some distance away. Would-be competitors had to stand behind the line and hit the large block. They had three chances, and it wasn't a hard shot.<br/><br/>And I missed each time.<br/><br/>Now, this did not ruin my game. It shaped my game in some interesting ways, and I had a fun time despite the bumps. But, please, do not say, "Okay, here is your gun stat, and it means you're really really good" and then tell me "You use your own skill in gun battles." These are contradictory.<br/><br/>If you want an element of chance, have players do good old Rock-Paper-Scissors, and have the winner add one or two to the gun score. But once you tell me it's my skill, then the stat is meaningless and shouldn't be in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382437/#Comment_382437" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T11:14:39+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 11:14AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya, Lisa--but there IS a case where you get both: special attacks.

In particular, the types of things that are generally removed for safety reasons, like disarming techniques or knocking someone backward. So you could have a Disarm attack, maybe once per fight, that would force your opponent to drop their weapon before continuing.<br/><br/>In a wild west game like that, wearing a 4 might mean that you have 4 special moves per fight (which is usually pretty badass). And by extension, you could assume that someone with a 0 or 1 probably had other things that were special about them, like special abilities for "cheating" at cards or influence with the mining consortium. (Which are examples of ways that me+ design can be used outside of combat.

Often strategies specific to the game are not transferable (like Go and Chess) to other actions, though general language, memory, and logic skills usually are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
