This is what happens to the souls of heroes and heroines in the word of <i>Fabula</i> (my frpg game)<br/><br/>It happened some weeks ago. We play once a week.<br/><br/>In the session this week another player mentioned "The Star of Xandras", and I looked at Gabriel just then; he beamed! His face shone with pride over his former character; the knight Xandras, and what he had done; his sacrifice. It was beautiful!<br/><br/>We try to play death as a significant and holy thing in my game. To see Gabriel shine with pride, confirms for me how meaningful such a praxis are. Burial, eulogies, and reminiscence gives something extra to the death of a character. They are important facets of the life a character live in the mind of the player.<br/><br/><i>Do you have positive experiences with death in role-playing games?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373954/#Comment_373954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T11:54:55+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 11:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Hitmen for the Snake God</i> the priest Nargem who was the one to recieve the holy command and their hit list from Kaa did a suicidal attack versus a general of a siege.

When the assassination succeeded and the generals bodyguards cut Nargem down everyone was relieved, including Nargem's players, that the obnoxious, crippled and insane priest had passed on to the sunny and rodent filled paradise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373956/#Comment_373956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T12:02:40+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 12:02PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Last Judgment</i> the wealthy and hypochondriac mold smuggler Jafaar had rejected his personal doctor and adopted son.

It may have been fueled by vengeance, but it was still a very positive experience with death.  I think being able to narrate your own end makes it much more enjoyable than "the kobold hits you for 12 points of damage.  You die."  Anything that makes it seem more like an event in a story than a random accident helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_373965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373965/#Comment_373965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T13:54:13+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  1:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BlazmoIntoWowee</cite>I think being able to narrate your own end makes it much more enjoyable than "the kobold hits you for 12 points of damage.

Missed opportunities are never good for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
