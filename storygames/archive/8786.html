(Yes, I know, it's a startling observation. Bear with me, I'm trying to figure something out - basically thinking while writing).<br/><br/>One of the viewpoints that gets bandied around is that indie games aren't like other products. They're not published with the same intention as large-scale commercial products (i. e. to be addictive and easily consumed by the customer, and to make the publisher a lot of money). They're based on a different kind of relationship between the author/publisher and the customer. <br/><br/>It's in the nature of indie publishing, which is often about the individual auteur's vision of... design, publishing, the whole process, you name it... that the expected relationship will vary from publisher to publisher. Some want to just "fire and forget", as seen in the recent thread on promotion of Swedish games: I write it, I put it up on Lulu, I'm done. Others want to get feedback from their customers - they put up forums, sell ashcans, whatever. Some write little personal notes in the games they send out. Others don't really care who buys their game. Some design for their friends. Others design for the whole world. Etc.<br/><br/>Now, here's my point: To find out exactly what a given indie author/publisher/auteur intends with their product, you actually have to ask them. Most of them/us don't communicate the expected relationship - our personal "indie contract" - to the customer. <br/><br/>I buy game X, and the author happily answers my questions and wants to know how my game went. I buy game Y, and the author gets sort of cranky when I offer him feedback. I buy game Z, and the author mails me out of the blue. I buy game A, and it's semi-comprehensible, and the author says it's an art experiment and wonders why I tried to play it. I buy game B, and it's smooth and well-explained and playable right out of the box. I buy game C, and it's the best game ever if I play it the way the author intended, which requires that I google and read threads for an hour or two. (These are all real-life examples).<br/><br/>I'm coming to the realization that many members of the indie scene/community will do whatever they bloody well want - and nobody can stop them. However, it's not always fun to be an indie customer if you have no idea what to expect when buying a game. It doesn't exactly make our games and our scene accessible, friendly, welcoming. It's chaotic, unpredictable, weird. Is that good? Depends on who you ask.<br/><br/>What it boils down to is this: <i>If you're not designing for everyone</i> - for the People Out There who aren't on SG or The Forge or whatever - <i>it might be a good idea to tell them that.</i> "This game was written because my friends wanted to buy a printed copy, so I put it on Lulu". "This game was written to see if I was able to finish a game, and I was, hooray! Let me know if you're able to play it straight from the book." "This game was written for people who are into socket-wrenching breakfast narrativism, and if you don't know what that means, perhaps you shouldn't buy this game." "This game is part of an ongoing design project where I investigate the relationship between reader and text - expect the unexpected".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194344/#Comment_194344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:19:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:19AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/><br/>What it boils down to is this:<i>If you're not designing for everyone</i>- for the People Out There who aren't on SG or The Forge or whatever -<i>it might be a good idea to tell them that.</i>"This game was written because my friends wanted to buy a printed copy, so I put it on Lulu".

I have had some trouble getting into this storygames thing because its such an ENORMOUS incrowd thing. At least the games could be a little more clear in communicating what group they're targeting, veterans of the community or  outsiders like myself? <br/><br/>thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194348/#Comment_194348" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:25:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, that's the best description of the community that I've ever seen.

Its not such a big deal for me Because I dont have an issue with pirating before I buy and thus can inspect the contents per say.<br/><br/>Myself I am not concerned at all with what the author has or was trying to do with their book (making intent statements and actual plays rather useless for me). I'm really concerned with whats in the book. I do find that the indie authors at times have a horrible time talking about whats in your book ( spirit of the century, and universalis I find fairly bad for this) and that should be fixed, not by embracing this indie distinction they have (by allowing them to further address their already addressed audience) but by the firm reminder that hey, if you sell a book, lots of people are going to read it, and most of them wont be your target audience so don't shut them out in the cold. <br/><br/>and no for the record, an unaccessible, unfriendly, unwelcoming, chaotic, unpredictible, wierd, scene is bad for a segment of publishers. (that was a period for those of you in the grammatical know). I really agree with everything your saying, I just really think everyone should stop indulging the indie darling, and tell them that A&gt; You gotta thrive to survive B&gt; that involves winning over people who weren't in the choir to start with. <br/><br/>If that involves people leaving the 'scene' per say, thats great. Less people pushing for unorthodoxy for the sake of other obscure subgroup politics is a plus in my books. They can even still be involved, I can't stop them. (althought honestly I think they would be better served with a notepad, stapler, and a soap box than with a rpg book.) <br/><br/>Anyway, I hope I'm not shitting to much in your thread, I agree with you, I just wish you to say what you know to be true (as in be perscriptive), rather than saying I can't do anything about it anyway, but here's a suggestion. Because honestly if you can't do anything about it besides suggestion, then this place is so not function as to not even be a community ( A community being a place where people are affected by others, or in other words where you can do something about stuff)<br/><br/>Wowrantastic. <br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194374/#Comment_194374" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:17:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:17AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 8:17AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think L7 is right, and anyway, why did anyone ever think that indie games would do any better or even any <i>different</i> even from "commercial" games on this point of communicating what the expectations are?  The original post sounds to me like it has identified the wrong mistake.  "We thought it would be so different from commercial games, which are a giant jumble, but look, we have a giant jumble!"  The solution to this dilemma is not to struggle and say "oh god how can I get all these cats to pull in the same direction and resolve the jumble", but to say "Christ, why did we ever think it would be different from commercial games?" and enjoy the crashing expectations, flailing uncertainty, angry flamewars and prolific fansites with bizarre hacks, just like the rest of RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194401/#Comment_194401" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T09:07:21+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  9:07AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on the fence on this issue. <br/><br/>On one hand, I agree with L7 in that I think indie publishers in general should be a little more concerned about writing games that are accessible to potential customers outside the community. But I also think it would be nice for an author to be upfront about the intended audience, assuming that the author is aware of where his/her game stands.<br/><br/>Not that one excuses the other. But I know there are a number of games I would've not purchased had the intended audience thing been more explicit. And that list would probably cause a flamewar.<br/><br/>I also think this has hurt indie game authors on the whole. Previously, I would snap up pretty much any indie-darling that came along. Now, I buy (maybe) three indie games a year. My initial reaction now is to Pass, not click PayPal.<br/><br/>Part of that is because of the "Buyer Beware" attitude I've developed towards indie games. I've become fatigued with buying half-baked rulesets that require me to research AP threads or contact the author directly for clarifications. Whereas before I wasn't as averse to giving something a spin and filling in the blanks. <br/><br/>I also wonder how much of my sentiment has leaked outside the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194403/#Comment_194403" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T09:11:15+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  9:11AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Part of that is because of the "Buyer Beware" attitude I've developed towards indie games.

But for me, at this point, its games I'm paying money for, and so I'm going to treat them more or less the same as the other games I pay money for.</blockquote>\nAmen.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>It's actually quite hard to make a game that's not playable in some way "out of the box", because every act of play is creative and individual to the player and the group and the moment, so in order to fail to be playable you not only have to have some devastating hole, but you have to block the creativity of the players, probably explicitly.  I can't even think of a game that has ever done that.</blockquote>\nThis is a pretty weak, enabling statement. Yeah, I can fuck around with some dice and a trust mechanic and figure some of an authors bullshit out, but that's not (often) the point. If I went to a restaurant ordered a steak then the chef came out with a cow and a torch and pneumatic bold gun I would not be happy with my purchase.  Also, i've been in the devastating hole. It's devastating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194948/#Comment_194948" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T10:54:02+00:00" title="March  1, 2009 10:54AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>This is a pretty weak, enabling statement.</blockquote>\nSo it is, yet it remains true and to the truth I must remain loyal, weak and enabling though I may be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194950/#Comment_194950" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T11:02:21+00:00" title="March  1, 2009 11:02AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also worth noting who JD's statements "enable" vis a vis where they land the authority of the game. <br/><br/>If you're thinking of games from the perspective of the designer, and of games as something that are primarily designed (as you probably should do if you are, say, designing a game) then sure, it's letting the designer off the hook for the work they ought to be doing. No one likes a lazy designer. <br/><br/>OTOH, if you're thinking of games from the perspective of the player, and of games as something that are primarily played, then its actually not enabling anything but player control.

However, I have noticed a defining theme about so-called "mainstream" games versus "indie games" (and many of you may disagree with me; this is merely my own observation through my own experience).  In mainstream games, with mainstream gamers (if there are such a thing), I have noticed that the whole thing seems very achievement and possession-oriented.  This was very true in the boffer LARPs I played in as well as the few times I played D n' D.  And perhaps it was a greedy set of people, I don't know.  On the other hand, with the indie games, the theme seems to be making the best story possible, which usually means periodically (or frequently) failing.  And failing again.  Failing or not getting what you want when you want it makes the game and thus the story more interesting.  A classic example of this is <i>Polaris</i>, where your endgame is failure and death.  It sounds like a bummer, but it can be very cool.  Or like Fate, where you get more points for playing up your flaws.  I haven't seen that dynamic as much in mainstream games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194986/#Comment_194986" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T00:37:24+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:37AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thing is, you can't trust people to explicitly turn people away from buying their game. So I'd rather say "If you ARE designing for 'everyone', make THAT explicit". That way, people won't be afraid to buy the game because it might turn out to be unplayable, and they know that if they have problems, they can count on you to clear them up, because you promised it'd be playable. And if someone makes a "mainstream indie" game and doesn't make it explicit, well, sucks to be them, since people cannot assume it's playable (for a given definition of "playable").<br/><br/>Trying to get people to say "Don't buy this game" to someone isn't gonna work. But telling people that they might get more customers by saying "DO buy this game, you'll have a good time" might. So the "default" of the indie games will be "you're gonna have to do some work to actually play this thing", and there will be exceptions, aimed at a larger market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
