It\u2019s memorable.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be a killer DM, I don\u2019t want blood. I joke around about it sometimes, but, some of these PC and NPC deaths have really been hard-hitting. <em>I am a fan.</em> I just don\u2019t let that fandom interfere with the refereeing one iota. The gloracle willed this.</p><p>Eero\u2026 dividing my answer up into two:</p><p><strong>Emotional and creative investment.</strong> Given the premise of running a game where BRD (brutal raptor death) is a possibility \u2014 and, again, that premise can <i>certainly</i> be brought into question \u2014 the option then becomes: should we just play dumb faceless meaningless redshirted disposable teens or should we invest in, feel, care about, risk, create, concern ourselves with the life and longings of these pawns?</p><p>A strength of D&amp;D is that it supports both. For every new PC you create, you can select how much you decide to care about it.</p><p>Have I been having a somber and quiet day today? With a non-zero amount of weeping? Yes. But. That\u2019s a strength of D&amp;D, the\u2026 actually <em>caring</em>.</p><p><strong>Mechanical complexity vs lethality.</strong> Level four isn\u2019t mid levels, is it?. It\u2019s still \u201clocal heroes\u201d tier. The rule in <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> (and this rule comes from the module text, i.e.\xa0it\u2019s not our house call) is that replacement PCs start at party level. We started with level 1 PCs, and they made it up to level 4 before they started dying. The lethality is\u2026 not really adjustable, given our choice of ruleset, module, and social contract. As noted, I brought both changing the ruleset, and/or changing the module, up for discussion. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I don\u2019t see how mechanical complexity inherently removes lethality. The module explicitly prehibits resurrection.</p><p>Again, the idea of \u201cdo we even want to play a jungle game with an about 4% chance of random BRD?\u201d is legit af. And I\u2019m not sure about the answer. But <strong>if</strong> we do, adding mechanical complexity is adding agency. Shield spells, teleport, these choices were <em><strong>validated</strong> [as <strong>choices</strong>] by being proven wrong</em> \u2014 they would\u2019ve been good vs the assassin vines from last week but not enough vs a hord of tiny li\u2019l hen-sized raptors. Abandoning your own friend, jumping out of the way letting 12 raptors eat him, and jumping on a horse to high tail it out of there: that choice meant that particular PC lived. But in the long run, karmically, and if the dead PC\u2019s player is going to reciprocate, it could turn out to be a bad choice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474829/#Comment_474829" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T11:08:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2018 11:08AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've seen the rise of fiction, like Claremont's X-Men or Kirkman's The Walking Dead, where heroes can die.

None of them are particularly mine and I am invested in the overall environment.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, I have one character. If that character dies, I have to stop playing \u2013 even if only a little while. I have relatively little investment in the environment as a whole because that's the GM's job.<br/><br/>Eero pointed out that systems which tie deep character back story to mechanical complexity and high lethality the don't mix. This is absolutely correct. When you make things into a time sink for a player, expect to have players be annoyed and irritated when their time is sunk.<br/><br/>But we have a ton of solutions to this sort of problem. The obvious one, the one that has been in play for literal decades at this point, and which was clearly a part of D&amp;D at the beginning is to break the idea that one player has one character. "Troupe style play" may have come into the vernacular with Ars Magica, but the idea of having multiple men-at-arms, henchmen, hangers on \u2013 all of that has been a big deal historically.<br/><br/>If you want high lethality, you have to look at games which do high lethality well \u2013 wargames. How do they do it? Well, rather than be invested in a single guy on the battlefield, one which can get destroyed at any moment with very little decision-making at the microscale which makes a difference, they get the player invested in a squad, or a platoon, or a company, or a lance, or a squadron, or some other accumulation of characters which generally start with less back story individually, but which accumulate story as gameplay occurs.<br/><br/>You might lose your squad leader and that sucks, but the entity which the player is engaged with playing goes on.<br/><br/>You created a situation in which you have a single hit point and when it goes you mourn your opportunity to play.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that doesn't end well.<br/><br/>You need to significantly change your approach to the way the game is realized if you want to have characters in a highly lethal environment which the players continue to engage with.<br/><br/>You need either or more characters per player, or/and reduce the amount of player ownership and have the players more involved with the characters as a group, or in some way play to a more ensemble cast structure. Because otherwise this is just going to go the same way over and over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474833/#Comment_474833" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T15:07:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  3:07PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things like these are the ones that make me want to use balanced encounters.

So, by chance operation something happened the Game Master doesn\xb4t like.<br/><br/>I remember an anecdote of John Cage. He composed his music by using chance operations. Once he said in an interview, at first he\xb4d differentiated the results of his chance operations between favored and unfavored outcomes. Later he learned to accept every outcome alike. "Meanwhile I love all sounds", he then said.<br/><br/>For my life this is an important story... even if I\xb4m a game master.<br/><br/>Maybe you want to become a Zen gamemaster... then you have to practice. Learn to accept all outcomes, if you use a chance operation. In the past I thought that this would be the goal to score.<br/><br/>Today I look at the problem from another viewpoint because now I know that I\xb4m no Zen gamemaster. There are some <i>sounds</i> I like more than others, I can\xb4t change it... so why should I allow an accident to decide?<br/><br/>Since I realized this, me and my players roll dice to a lesser extent... only if there really is no favored outcome. It seems to be good for our game. Most outcomes are wanted now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474840/#Comment_474840" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T16:28:46+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  4:28PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2018 4:29PM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The quality of this encounter</b><br/><br/>The same session also had an encounter I had written featuring one of the <i>Fire on the Velvet Horizon</i> monsters and it was more agential and the players navigated that one well.<br/><br/>Like, this is "my fault" or "shitty" to the extent that the module is \u2014 a module that I did bring to the table and suggest, so, sure, feeling guilty about that.<br/><br/>The encounter isn't just "3d6 raptors", it's pretty explicit about specifically what happens, what the chances for detecting them is etc etc. And, I went over it with the players afterwards as our debriefing.<br/><br/>My house rule, which was in play, allowed one of the players to divide the raptors between him and his friend. So that's already more agential than the RAW. He chose 0 on himself and 12 on the friend.<br/><br/>I asked the player if we should change ruleset, change campaign, and I also asked if I should remove that encounter. He answered "no", separately, for all three questions, and most emphatically on the last one.<br/><br/>It's not my job to come up with solutions for the players but here are some ways this could've gone differently <div class="Spoiler">have NPCs and assign some the raptor attacks to them. Have higher perception as to not get surprised. Work better together and don't abandon each other. Or, do, prioritizing SOMEONE surviving from the party than risking EVERYONE. Have more players. This is tied in to the attendance problem. The rocks get punished b/c the flakes. Or, as they did \u2014 gamble that something like this isn't going to happen. It's a risk/reward and the reward of saving hench money for the risk of something happening they deemed worth it. They stayed along the coast for a four hex trip to a level 1 dungeon in order to get some easy gold. They gambled that nothing would happen during those four days. And, over 40 days in the jungle before, they've never met the raptors before so... [otoh, they're not super familiar with the coastal encounter table].</div><br/><br/>And as far as "balanced encounters" go... I usually don't bother to calculate it out but I did retroactively and this particular encounter is considered good for four level 4s. (And they were only two.) The players doubted that, particularly they thought a raptor shouldn't be CR 1/4, compared to wolves, another pack tactics CR 1/4 creature with similar HP but with a prone condition and 7 dmg rather than two attacks 4+5. (Multiple attacks are more likely to crit and also have a higher impact on death saves.)<br/><br/>And, like... that's the play culture. The players vs the module, and I'm the referee between them. This player is a true kitchen table spike, he doesn't want any shortcuts. He wants to earn his wins.<br/><br/><b>Emotional investment, and zen</b><br/><br/>Yamada Koun once said:\n<blockquote>If you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho</blockquote>\nDoing emotional work is legit, even post-satori. (Not that the player was crying \u2014 he was upset, though.)<br/><br/>and Paul Reps relays Zengetsu's advice:\n<blockquote>Living in the world yet not forming attachments to the dust of the world is the way of a true Zen student.</blockquote>\nHaving your PC be a disposable redshirt is a way to avoid attachments. But it's not *living in the world*.<br/><br/>But to clarify: we are creating more than one PC per player to have at the ready. Since we've had a string of PC deaths these last four sessions. This was our first day doing that.<br/>This player has an extra character, a sage goliath with negative int. I was just particularly attached to this eladrin wild mage. And the unusually short time he got to live once ventured out in the jungle, compared to the joy of rolling up lifepaths, siblings, teachers etc.<br/><br/>Chiarina... you are right. But this <i>is</i> practice. It's so easy to flinch. Zen acceptance is difficult work. This isn't meant to be self-congratulatory. At all. I had a horrible session and I've had a horrible time moving on. But self-revelatory. I have struggled all day with the outcome of yesterday's session. And I'll hold it. And I'll do this work.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474841/#Comment_474841" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T16:49:13+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  4:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2018 4:49PM by SquidLord.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Having your PC be a disposable redshirt is a way to avoid attachments. But it's not *living in the world*.</blockquote>\nWho said anything about having your PC be a disposable redshirt? Nobody said that. I certainly didn't say that.<br/><br/>And I pointedly didn't say that increasing the number of characters at the disposal of a given player is a way to decrease attachment or involvement. Pointedly, and I can tell you this from long experience, it does not. There's a cogent argument to be made that it increases attachment, because it increases continuity. In a high lethality universe, if you only have a single pawn it is in your best interests not to get attached. It will be going away soon and there's no reason for you to care overly much. However, an organization, a group, a team, a squad \u2013 these things continue in the absence of any single agent. The loss of an agent becomes part of a story unto itself, because there are people left to tell it.<br/><br/>There are two elements in play here: when your character dies, if it's the only one you have, you have to stop playing. You have already defined that the universe is going to kill your character.<br/><br/>You have no room to look surprised.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the "extra character" may have considerable grounds to get more invested in the struggles, strife, and tribulations that are actually occurring at the table because it doesn't have all of the psychological baggage for the player that remembering complicated life paths, siblings, teachers, etc. bring to the table. The only experience that will shape what you do are the high point elements that you had the time to illuminate roughly and the stuff that happens at the table with other players.<br/><br/>I guarantee, the stuff that happens at the table is far more important than four pages of back story. For everybody at the table.<br/><br/>The sooner that you can internalize that, the sooner that you can get on to enjoying engaging gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474842/#Comment_474842" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T16:49:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  4:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2018 4:55PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The encounter isn't just "3d6 raptors", it's pretty explicit about specifically what happens, what the chances for detecting them is etc etc. And, I went over it with the players afterwards as our debriefing.<br/>. . . <br/>I asked the player if we should change ruleset, change campaign, and I also asked if I should remove that encounter.

Sounds like there was just a mismatch here between your group of 2 players and a module that expected 4.  I like the solution you mentioned of filling in that gap with NPCs when necessary.<br/><br/>I don't think you did anything wrong by failing to anticipate exactly how that encounter would go down.  With 4 players, the failed surprise check would not have been the end of the world at all.  And, as you said, that one check didn't remove <i>all</i> player agency.

Because the goal of play is to achieve the authentic outcomes, losing the purity of the process would be a greater loss than the creative destruction involved with a TPK is. This is why we stick to the purity in the face of loss: we can either retain our characters and lose our pride, or vice versa, and for the people who are even interested in playing hardcore that's not ultimately a difficult choice, even if it can be an emotional one. A set-back for character development, but a win in fostering the collective delusion about the "realness" of play.<br/><br/>I've had similar quick and arbitrary-seeming deaths occur to characters who have been played to mid-levels (for me 4th is clearly mid-levels, even if that might be different in 5th edition) legitimately.

I don't <i>know</i> why we return to it.<br/><br/>We're banging our heads against the door instead of just... instead of just not doing that.<br/><br/>Mark Rosewater once said that if a game designer would design a lamp, they'd make the lamp a challenge to switch on or off.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this particular player the angriest is when he believes I've dropped a hint or a spoiler.

Not necessarily because they hate you and want to see you fail (hopefully not, anyways!), but because they want to provide "the proper amount of difficulty" to make success worthwhile. Or something along those lines, anyway.<br/><br/>That's not to say that people aren't capable of stumping themselves, or that given the opportunity everyone would just be a static self-indulgent lump that never left their comfort zone, just that having something actively pushing against you makes the preconditions for that kind of dynamic push-pull appear much faster.<br/><br/>But you're right, "What have I got in my pocket?" style problems are just wildly unfair and unfun, and this sort of antagonistic creative drive definitely relies on a sometimes rather narrow sweet-spot. But too tight and you risk the loss of agency because things are either too easily gameable or too restrictively unwinnable.

This combines time, money, logistics, personal skills and emotional issues.<br/><br/>Sometimes these are adversial situations, though modern society does try to make explicit adversiality rare. Sports and other games are a typical example, as is high-stakes enterpreneurship and many aspects of politics.<br/><br/>Simulating these and practicing the type of thinking required to succeed in these situations is a reasonable use of roleplaying games. This requires some amount of unwanted, for if all outcomes are equal, the entire exercise is void.<br/><br/>(It is, of course, possible to do many other things with roleplaying games.)</p></div></blockquote>\nThat makes total sense for playing to understand the explore those kinds of situations!! <br/>The fact that that sort of stuff is realistic is actually another reason why I don't like it, because I'm explicitly not simulating reality when I roleplay; I'm simulating story logic. <br/>Thank you so much for the explanation though, because that's a line of thought I hadn't really considered at all before! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Could you possibly expand the "adversarial reckoning" thing?

Not necessarily because they hate you and want to see you fail (hopefully not, anyways!), but because they want to provide "the proper amount of difficulty" to make success worthwhile. Or something along those lines, anyway.<br/><br/>That's not to say that people aren't capable of stumping themselves, or that given the opportunity everyone would just be a static self-indulgent lump that never left their comfort zone, just that having something actively pushing against you makes the preconditions for that kind of dynamic push-pull appear much faster.<br/><br/>But you're right, "What have I got in my pocket?" style problems are just wildly unfair and unfun, and this sort of antagonistic creative drive definitely relies on a sometimes rather narrow sweet-spot. But too tight and you risk the loss of agency because things are either too easily gameable or too restrictively unwinnable. I think it's a constant problem in this style of gaming.</div></blockquote>\nThat's totally understandable!<br/>I think some of my confusion comes from the style of roleplay I'm interested in and how it conflicts with all of that as far as concepts.<br/>In the way that I play, if something was shooting down ideas, we would remove it from the table, whether it be a mechanic or some particularly grumpy person, because our primary goal in roleplay is to express our ideas and explore exactly the things we want to explore in play - nothing more, nothing less. Which requires pretty absolute agency, with everyone working together, and the rules working as our tool to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish. <br/><br/>We also though specifically strive to be challenged emotionally by our play, just like how we're all fans of fiction that challenges us emotionally, so we very much get outside of our comfort zones without anything telling us we have to, because that's just the kind of fiction we're interested in generating. <br/>I can totally understand the value of having some outside force to help with that if a group isn't good at expressing their goals or whatnot though! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(I also just actually don't get the concept of "the proper amount of difficulty to make success worthwhile, but that's another story altogether.)<br/><br/>[I'm also thinking that there's a significant level where my confusion is based in the fact that I seem to on some level just not "get" emergent narrative/play-to-find-out at all, no matter how much it's explained to me.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474859/#Comment_474859" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T20:58:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  8:58PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2018 9:00PM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            b                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474860/#Comment_474860" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:00:07+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:00PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I was actually including that as part of the category of problems someone else came up with, so emergent problems were already covered, but I realize I made that terribly unclear, because most don\u2019t categorize the system in the same category as like the other people at the table, but\u2026</p></div></blockquote><p>That\u2019s totally fair but then specifically that subcategory of that category is my fave.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[I\u2019m also thinking that there\u2019s a significant level where my confusion is based in the fact that I seem to on some level just not \u201cget\u201d emergent narrative/play-to-find-out at all, no matter how much it\u2019s explained to me.]</p></div></blockquote><p>Not sure if you don\u2019t get how it it works, or if you do get how it works but you don\u2019t get the appeal.</p><p>Like I\u2019ve got a pretty clear picture of 90s style play but, like you, I am baffled as to the appeal.</p><p>And this remind me that these raptors aren\u2019t just about the challenge.

To me, the other outcome doesn't exist, because it didn't happen, so then it's not real in the story-space. <br/>It's a vague nothingness that doesn't exist unless it appears on-screen, like everything else. <br/><br/>For me, the idea of those kinds of choices just breaks my immersion in a story unless it's a story where a major character has some sort of retcon ability (whether it be rewinding time, changing reality, etc) and those outcomes are explored on screen, or if you write a bunch of AU stories with the same characters that are effectively "This is what would happen if instead of Luke joining the Rebellion, he had joined the Empire" or whatever. <br/><br/>So that's kind of why the whole concept of "making choices" in roleplay just generally doesn't interest me a lot, and why I don't at all get the concept of possibility of failure being needed to validate success.<br/><br/>I think some of that is also maybe a thing of the fact that in the main game I play, players can always define the outcome of their own actions as far as pass-fail, with it just being a choice of which best fits the story you're telling with the situation. (With a couple of edge case exceptions where someone else has the ability to override those decisions, like the Ace's Tragic Flaw ability that allows others to declare something fails when the Ace's Complex Issue is at 1+, but like I said, those are considerable edge cases, and even then, the player playing the Ace has significant options to negate that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474863/#Comment_474863" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:12:20+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:12PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yukamichi that was a great post. but haunting                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474864/#Comment_474864" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:18:46+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:18PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The solution to the raptor jungle <div class="Spoiler">does not have to be mechanical.

Thank you for that explanation!<br/>Which like, gets into the thing I was saying about a lot of my confusion definitely being a result of radically different playstyles, because for me, consequences and world simulation are about the last thing I'm interested in in play, you know?<br/>Thank you so much for that explanation though; it really made what you're talking about (and your playstyle in general) really click for me (well, the world simulation stuff; the emergent stuff still confuses me a bit, but I don't think that's something I can understand).<br/><br/>Also, question: Would it be impossible to just rewrite the table to not include the BRD, since the BRD is an issue in this situation? And then maybe when the PCs can handle it a bit better, the original table with the BRD could be added back in? Although at that point it's more just BRF (Brutal Raptor Fight) instead of BRD (although I guess it could still theoretically be BRD at that point, if they get really unlucky in the fight).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474866/#Comment_474866" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:23:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:23PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emma, about choices... you DO make choices: when you are setting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">up</span> your arcs.

I love such games <i>too</i>, and, I've even introduced some hybrid mechanics to get <i>some</i> of those qualities in, but it's not the main draw of D&amp;D for me. The main draw is to see world logic (even though it's a weird world with zombies and dinos and fey) have precedence over story logic. In a world where you can turn a leather ribbon into a Hold Person spell... can you survive it when skeletons can stir awake and shoot arrows at you? Etc. It's not realistic but... it's a lab. It's a place for us to run experiments.

I enjoy writing my own stories and playing through them, but I would also be generally equally happy playing through someone else's story, as long as the story was good. (I mean, that's basically what the Chuubo's modules do, and I really really love the Chuubo's modules).<br/><br/>Chuubo's very much is a game made for people who really love fiction and want to keep spinning on that fiction, ye. There's a really good quote from Jenna where she describes Chuubo's as being built on the fanfic impulse, and talks about how Chuubo's is close to the media fandom like how wargames are close to the military fandom.<br/><br/>It is very very much different than what DnD does, with DnD being closer to the military fandom than the media fandom. <br/>The experimentation thing actually makes a huge amount of sense to me; thank you for explaining it that way, because that makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>I just tbh can't really get the appeal of finding out which outcome happens. I can't really even get the appeal of multiple possible outcomes. Like, I get that it's just a playstyle difference, but I guess I can't really wrap my head around the appeal of simulation of world, because that kind of simulation just seems wholly uninteresting to me, and like it would only really appeal to maybe historians? Or just generally people who don't care about characters, maybe?<br/>...I'm being a bit incomprehensible, aren't I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474870/#Comment_474870" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:50:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:50PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it's like our little ant farm or doll house<br/>except with BRD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474871/#Comment_474871" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T21:56:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  9:56PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474876/#Comment_474876" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T23:42:59+00:00" title="June 17, 2018 11:42PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the challenge-oriented gamer, there is a paradox present.

It's all "your character doesn't succeed at the thing they were trying to do". It's just the consequences that are a variable.<br/><br/>I think if you're looking for a term for the competitive stuff, "win" and "lose" might be better than "fail" and "succeed", because at way more gets at the concepts of what's being talked about, whereas "failure" implies something that can be either IC or OOC or both at once in some games, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474881/#Comment_474881" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T01:00:48+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  1:00AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/chiarina" rel="nofollow">chiarina</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>@ Eero: I agree.

I can't really even get the appeal of multiple possible outcomes. Like, I get that it's just a playstyle difference, but I guess I can't really wrap my head around the appeal of simulation of world, because that kind of simulation just seems wholly uninteresting to me, and like it would only really appeal to maybe historians? Or just generally people who don't care about characters, maybe?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThere is the historical impulse, for sure. People sometimes have discussions about would there really be castles and armies and such in a (D&amp;D) fantasy world, gives all the wizards and dragons and such. An interesting way of answering the question is to take a fantasy world with all the elements and start playing a wizard, a dragon or a queen, and see what you can make of it. Maybe the castles turn out to be useless, and maybe not. But now you understand the question a lot better, in any case, and have one answer in a particular scenario.<br/><br/>But this can also be about characters, or at least characteristics. Inquisitors are often seen as suspicious figures. So, it is interesting to start playing an inquisitor who is genuinely good, however one understands that, and seeing how that turns out. Maybe it will be a heart-rending tragedy, or maybe it turns out that the church actually is filled with good people and is a force of good. But, again, one will have a clearer vision of the pressures and dynamics in the situation, and what kind of people might manage in the position. It might also create what one thinks is a good story, if the set-up is suitable for that.<br/><br/>Having a fair dose of simulation does make it less likely that the story turns out to be unbelievable, because there are too many dramatic coincidences. If a murder goes unnoticed because there is thunder just as the gun is fired, that sounds like a suspicious coincidence. But if we estimate the chances for that being true (say 1/10) and roll dice to see if it happens, and it does, then it is much easier for me to believe. But usually that will not happen; but again, given a suitably interesting starting situation, whatever happens is still likely to be interesting. And if not, then move on to something that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474887/#Comment_474887" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T08:19:15+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:19AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes total sense, and thank you for that explanation, Thanuir! That actually helps a lot, the whole thing with the experimentation and testing and stuff. <br/><br/>I think the thing with the story being unbelievable is a stumbling block for me as far as confusion, because for me, the thunder not happening as the gun fires in the story where the murder is a secret would for me feel unrealistic, instead of the thunder feeling like a suspicious coincidence if it did happen.<br/>But that's a thing of how I think in story logic, and in a lot of ways wish that the real world were governed by story logic instead of the harsh real world logic that it's governed by, so then for me, when a story doesn't operate like a story, it feels extremely unrealistic to me and falls apart for me, because it doesn't feel like a real story if it doesn't operate like a story.<br/>Which is also a big part of why I don't "get" emergent narrative/play-to-find-out, because it doesn't feel like stories to me; it feels like simulation, since stories are things you can find out the details of and know about before you go into them (and I'm the type who even with passive media will read spoilers obsessively before consuming a piece of media, and who will be reluctant to consume a piece of media if I can't find spoilers for it), and the fact that I see roleplaying as this very authorial type of thing, and as a writer I'm the type who obsessively outlines and plans stuff before I write, so it feels not-like-writing to me for the authors to not know where the story is going, so the whole thing of roleplaying just falls apart for me when emergent narrative/play-to-find-out is a thing in it, if that makes any kind of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474888/#Comment_474888" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T08:28:45+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:28AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The word "story" has been polysemically overloaded, for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474889/#Comment_474889" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T08:32:19+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:32AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2018 8:33AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very very true!<br/>I mean story in the context of a story like a novel or a manga or a movie or something would have, with dramaturgical structures, operating on story logic, etc, etc, etc.<br/>Just to clarify what I talk about when I say it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474890/#Comment_474890" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T08:34:53+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:34AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, and, when I want those things, I know where to go to find it <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>And when I want to, like... um...

Or maybe the problem is that these are the wrong processes to generate the kind of emergent problems you want. <br/><br/>But you've said that, no, this is not what you want.   Now you need to <i>believe</i> that, because it sounds like you are very attached to the idea of some sort of ideal OSR play that says that this has to be a thing in order for your game to be "good".   Which is a problem.  It feels like you don't trust yourself. <br/><br/>I feel like you're just too "all in" on your game style here, because this game is working as intended, and you don't like it, but you're trying to convince yourself that this is the way your game should be.  It's not. It's not great. You had a bad time.  And you don't need to have bad times to have great play.  It's not a "gloracle" -- it's just dice and charts. There's nothing glorious or oracular about it.  It's not more right than you are. <br/><br/>I feel like I've said this before, but try to hold on more loosely.  I get the sense of someone who is desperately seeking amazing.  You keep trying different styles and turning them up to 11 and then they break and you are crushed because you are trying <i>so hard</i>.  Paradoxically, I feel like if you were trying less hard, you'd enjoy it more.   This isn't so kind of zen statement either - describing this as some sort of spiritual trial that you need to overcome feels like it ties back into the idea of taking it too seriously.  I know your games are super important to you, but I think it's possible to hurt them by caring too much.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not saying to get less emotionally invested in the characters, but rather, to get less emotionally invested in the idea and ideal of the game, because I feel like at least some of the pain here is the dissonance of having felt that this style of game was perfect for you when it turns out it might not be.  As you say yourself - this stuff melted your mind, and that doesn't tend to lead to the clearest assessment of what you really want.<br/><br/>Also, Eero is right, as usual.<br/><br/>Edit: Oops, there was a second page that I didn't read. =/ Hopefully it doesn't render any of this mean or irrelevant.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474898/#Comment_474898" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T17:50:07+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  5:50PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the gloracle is 100% pure sacred magic\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474904/#Comment_474904" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T23:13:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2018 11:13PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the gloracle is 100% pure sacred magic\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThat makes you sacred magic too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474906/#Comment_474906" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T23:37:26+00:00" title="June 18, 2018 11:37PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra is demonstrating a technique often called "constructive denial". It's an useful hygienic principle in GMing a certain sort of wargamey D&amp;D: by constructing a pretense that disassociates the GM from certain choices they make, they can engage what amounts to a casual form of automatic writing - making choices without making causal cognitive connections between their own desires and the outcomes they arrive at. Doing this sort of thing right is essentially mandatory for playing a game that is simultaneously emotionally engaging and impeccably fair.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D heritage is full of these disassociations because of how reliant the early game was on a neutral referee. Deconstructing this edifice by pinpointing how the players themselves are ultimately responsible for their choices - including the choice of rolling the dice when they do - is an useful and necessary step in creating something different, but it may not help one to become a better referee. Pretending that the game is objective and fair helps make it more so.<br/><br/>As a different example of the same phenomenon, I like to pretend that experience points are a really objective and sport-like measurement of player achievement, and I act as if this was the case, going so far as to detach character level from their XP count when I want to make a higher-level character, because in my little pretense it's impossible for an experience point to exist mechanically without it having been legitimately brought into existence by the process of play. Casual campaigns and monty hauls do not exist in my fantasy land, and every character with 10 000 xp has been played for what amounts to 10 000 points of legitimate achievement. My choosing this pretension is not a mental defect, but rather a little piece of play-acting that enables me to maintain the appropriate mind-set in awarding experience rewards and projecting a sense of accomplishment to the players. Essentially, by choosing to care about the points we imbue them with meaning that helps orient and define the challenge of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474907/#Comment_474907" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-19T01:14:25+00:00" title="June 19, 2018  1:14AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The D&amp;D heritage is full of these disassociations because of how reliant the early game was on a neutral referee.</p></div></blockquote><p>If by \u201cearly game\u201d you mean the quite recent game that the OSR amplified and propagated in their hunt for the early game, then yes <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20672/d-d-expert-set-dice-shenanigans/p1" rel="nofollow">But we\u2019ve talked about that before.</a></p><p>Gygax\u2019 writing is full of evidence of \u201chygiene breach\u201d.</p><p>If there are any philosophers in the audience they might remember the Lisp macro battles where the second generation was way more concerned with \u201chygiene\u201d and strictness than the first.

When I run this game, I am a referee.</p><p>Before we came to live here, there was a cobra in a bowl that always gave true answers. Storytellers would set up shop with such a cobra in the back room. In the front room, they\u2019d gather an audience. In the back room, they\u2019d have the cobra bowl. And they would excuse themselves, go back there, and then return out to the front room and continue telling their story. Some of the storytellers would rely heavily on the cobra\u2019s answers. Only disregarding it if they thought it didn\u2019t make sense for the story \u2013 perhaps never in practice, just allowing themselves the idea as a safety net. Others would rely on the cobra talk <em>most</em> of the time, to ground their story in truth, but at key moments spin their yarns freely. Another type of storyteller would be most reliant on their own tales, and only listen to the cobra for inspiration when their glass was running dry and they needed some suggestion or prompt which to disregard or follow according to their own whim. And others still would keep the cobra bowl tightly packaged up in the back room, never ever listening to it.</p><p>Such was the spectrum among the storytellers. And there were much struggle and infighting among them. For the storytellers, the question of how often they disregarded or listened to the cobra bowl was a point of pride and shame and anger. Their relationship to the cobra \u2013 the cobra helping them, they helping the cobra, the cobra being their tool, the cobra being their guide\u2026 was always personal and different. A storyteller with great knowledge on how to care for a cobra, how to listen to it, and only rarely straying from it when\u2026 when they deemed other goals more important\u2026 would take great umbrage at being compared to someone with some shriveled up snake bones in the back.</p><p>This was the tradition among the storytellers. Among the curators.</p><p>But we, who strive to be referees\u2026 the quibbles among storytellers does not concern us<br/>we take the cobra out of it\u2019s bowl. And toss into the front room.

Just as the macro philosophers eventually developed implicit renaming with explicit injection, so have we developed new games, houserules etc etc. Perhaps one day I\u2019ll play a system where the chance of BRD (Brutal Raptor Death) is lower than 4%. Or higher. I have proposed changing rules, changing campaigns, adding or removing house rules. Which particular gloracle we rely on is a matter that\u2019s up for discussion with the entire table.

If you are a slave to the dice, then you're not really necessary.  You could be cut out of the picture entirely and other people could listen to the dice.   But that's probably not true is it? Because you do more than just interpret the dice. So you're probably never reaching absolute referee status.  Indeed, I'm not actually convinced it's possible to reach "peak referee" -- it's likely a limit based function.  And what I'm still hoping I can get across is: Maybe 99.99% Referee is less fun than 99% referee, since 100% referee is a fiction anyway.

Manage hidden information. The other players may not read the module text. It's not like Pandemic Legacy or The Citadel of Chaos where the material is physically set up in a way to be gradually revealed. Instead, it supports a finely-grained random access.<br/><br/>2. Enable the 'try anything'-nature of D&amp;D. They want to try to tame a turtle they find in the jungle? I create rules for it. They want to create their own bug salve from ingredients in the jungle? I create rules for it. Bring the rule up with the table and check if there's still buy-in. It's not like ASL where there is a comprehensive but overwhelming rules set. Instead, we can grow or shrink the rules in a way that suits us.<br/><br/>3. This is the part with the most subjectivity: Play the NPCs. Sometimes there is heuristics or dice there, like the raptor attack which was fully scripted in the module text. Sometimes there is more leeway.<br/><br/>komradebob, the two teams are PCs vs module. Fiction vs fiction. And the PCs are subjected to a difficult challenge. The participants do their best to find out who wins, according to restrictions such as some information hiding, some dice rolls, some role division. The players do a good job being neutral with things like 'oh, my LAST pc learned fact X, but I haven't learned it yet' (sometimes to ridiculous degree like sending three parties to the same trap) or when a PC is possessed by a haunted cloak or w/e. I strive for learning to be similarly neutral in how I run the module.

That ideal is a cornerstone, without it there can be no fiction-based challenge play.<br/><br/>Players in this type of campaign can struggle a <i>lot</i> with their trust in the referee. They wrestle with their own ego, and the temptation of blaming the messenger for any outcomes. This is a poison to the creative process, what the players are collectively attempting to accomplish. Sometimes a player with less self-awareness or less commitment to the common ideal starts talking this way, and it ruins the game.<br/><br/>"It's the GM's fault that we encountered a too hard encounter."<br/>"It is not fair that we were not given the appropriate tools for the job."<br/>"We could choose to fudge these results and instead pick the ones we like."<br/><br/>The hygiene of play is maintained so tightly precisely because this type of sentiment is so destructive to the GM's ability to do their job: where would your moral strength for doing even the unpleasant things come from if the group doubted your neutrality? Worse, if you doubted it yourself? You would be a bully who destroys good things arbitrarily. To do the referee's job, you have to believe that you are striving to do objective simulation with fair reasoning from non-rigged precepts. If something awful happens, it is what it is, and not some sort of subtle fuck-you from the GM to this or that player.<br/><br/>At its simplest: the adventurers are walking in a hallway and a pit trap opens below them. One of them plunges to their death. The GM rolled a die to randomize which one it was, and the victim rolled a saving throw. Can you, or can you not, accept that this was a value-neutral simulative process? Did the GM choose you to die in some round-about way?<br/><br/>I don't think that a person who blames the GM can play a game like this meaningfully. For them there's always another turtle down the chain of causation: the GM was the one who chose to put that pit trap there, after all, and they were the one who chose for a pit trap to do X points of damage when you stumble in there. The fact the falling damage math is very simple, non-interpretative and over 40 years old means nothing, as the GM was the one who chose to use this rules-set over any other - and besides, they've got the golden rule anyway, so they could choose to <i>not</i> apply the rule this time. The fault lies with the GM, and they're insane if they think they are a "referee".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474923/#Comment_474923" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-19T11:38:51+00:00" title="June 19, 2018 11:38AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also looks to me like your argument depends on several layers of semantics traps.<br/><br/>I have been clear enough what <i>I mean</i> when using the seven letters "referee" in this context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474924/#Comment_474924" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-19T11:46:05+00:00" title="June 19, 2018 11:46AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Similarly, I've used the word "storyteller" in a novel way too.

Soccer, by contrast, may end with a single goal scored in 120 minutes (cf. the last worldcup finale, Germany vs. Argentina), and this may be considered luck (if there was a large difference in the number of promising attempts on the opponents' goal). This makes soccer an emotionally wrenching experience for fans -- sometimes the best team does <i>not</i> win (not talking about this particular match anymore, BTW).<br/><br/>That said, my position above is philosophical because in practice I've never seen a TPK without multiple decisions and die rolls involved.<br/><br/>MERP's Moria supplement famously has the Balrog on the encounter table (1:100, if I remember correctly). I think it wouldn't feel like Moria without this. And if the Balrog does actually turn up...<br/><br/>... he might have good day (i.e. an agenda other than killing intruders). (Reaction Roll)<br/>... the party might be able to flee. (Encounter Distance / Initiative)<br/>... a character might sacrifice himself by drawing the balrog after him, splitting from the party. (Tactics / Guts)<br/>... the whole party might scatter to the four winds, hoping one or more make it out of Moria alone. (Tactics / Luck)<br/>... the party may try diplomacy. (Roleplay / Luck, or a combination)<br/>... the party may try to surrender (e.g. by abasing themselves in worship). (see above)<br/><br/>And finally, the party may kill the balrog (with a very, very lucky critical hit in MERP).<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>I think the cobra example is fine, by the way. I think the DM's mindset matters.<br/><br/>Do I use the rules to inspire me?<br/>(Feeling proud if I manage to follow them all while weaving my story, even.)<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>Do I simulate a world, come hell or high water?<br/>(This does not obviate the need for a DM, as no set of rules can account for all possible situations or even make sense in all possible situations. Making sudden loud noises (e.g. with a horn) may drive off natural predators like raptors, but what are the chances? There are rules for dropping rations to distract monsters but should this rule apply to the lembas we've brought?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474928/#Comment_474928" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-19T14:54:19+00:00" title="June 19, 2018  2:54PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hours spent on detailed character backstory adds even more of this factor:<br/><br/><img alt="Bleed in games" src="http://pbfcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PBF134-Game_System.gif"/><br/><br/>Even for me <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474931/#Comment_474931" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-19T17:25:22+00:00" title="June 19, 2018  5:25PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assumed it was clear that all the numbers in my post were for purposes of example only.  And I disagree with you assertion, Sandra, that this represents "leaving the cobra in the back room" (I don't really like this analogy, but here we go.) -- or rather, I believe that it is impossible to throw the cobra into the front room.  Maybe you can carry him there, but you can't put him down.  Which means that even if you are willing to let him bite people, you are still making decisions about where you stand, or possible even involuntary actions like jerking back when the snake you are carrying makes a sudden, startling movement.  You can't just throw the cobra.  This seems to be contradicted by Eero's example, but it is not, because Eero's example is the sort of thing that you can completely disclaim responsibility for.  Yes, you can reach 100% "referee" in that very specific circumstance.  But you can't do it for an entire game.<br/><br/>Imagine a hypothetical counterexample wherein the party is fighting an intelligent monster in a room in that dungeon. How do you choose who the monster attacks? Sure, you could roll dice, but at that point, the monster probably ceases to behave intelligently, spreading damage around instead of trying to eliminate a threat.  So how do you choose who the monster attacks?  You can try as hard as you want, but you're still making a decision about what the monster does based on, essentially, your feelings and opinions.  You have left the role of 100% referee.   The best way to resolve these sorts of things has been the subject of argument before there was an internet.  You can TRY to be objective. It's noble. Eero sets out the reasons you might want to.<br/><br/>But you're never going to be perfectly objective. You can't "throw the cobra".  It won't let go of you. 100% referee is an illusion.  Which means you can't get there for all your striving.  Which means that you might want to focus your striving in the areas that produce the best results, and strive less in areas where you could ruin your game by striving too hard.<br/><br/>Advice given.

I've posted about her here before. It's exactly as Eero describes: She absolutely could not buy into the idea that when bad things happened to the characters, it was due to the rules and not my volition. Her accusations that I was cheating became increasingly wild, detached for reality, and outright abusive. All the while, whenever we'd actually talk about the game, she'd claim that she was fine with it being challenging and so on... which is part of why I don't trust what players say, only what they do in the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474988/#Comment_474988" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T12:49:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2018 12:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh i remember her                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474989/#Comment_474989" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T13:15:33+00:00" title="June 21, 2018  1:15PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience (and judgement) the attendance problems among my gaming circles have been about 50% due to creative issues such as whether the player likes or dislikes hardcore wargame D&amp;D, and 50% because they just don't find gaming in general that important. Significantly, I don't trust player self-reporting either - different people self-express in different ways, and only a minority even understands themselves. It's the rare gamer who has the rarefied experience to even be capable of genuinely comparing two different styles of game, not to speak of being able to analytically isolate the aspects of a game that they like.<br/><br/>In other words: when you ask, everybody loves "story", everybody loves "challenge", because both are socially accepted high virtues of the form. ("Immersion" is another one, that also polls high whenever you ask about it.) Whether they factually like these things to be present in their game, and whether they will actually engage them themselves, is an entirely different thing. That's something you will only learn by exposing the player to a clear, high-quality sample of the thing; if they don't even recognize it when it comes and goes, odds are good that they're actually more in love with the idea of being that kind of person than with the thing itself.<br/><br/>(In my experience male gamers in particular regularly maintain a self-identity as tough real-challenge types. This makes it difficult to talk about the level of actual hardcore challenge play that some of us engage in, as you can't know if they're really on board with that or if they've just never encountered it and imagine themselves to be tough guys who like adversity. You'll know once you see them in actual play, but not before.)<br/><br/>But even with players whom I <i>know</i> to grok the form and like it, about half of them are flakey fair-weather gamers who don't actually schedule the game in their calendars, and consequently will skip sessions for entirely avoidable alternate engagements. Clearly there is a demography of gamers who enjoy the game but are nevertheless flakes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474990/#Comment_474990" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T13:22:35+00:00" title="June 21, 2018  1:22PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ugh why did this thread now become about the attendance thread, that thread already was supposed to be about that                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474993/#Comment_474993" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T14:08:43+00:00" title="June 21, 2018  2:08PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you as a player could entwine your next character's background with the previous one and make the game more about legacy, so dying becomes a bit less frustrating as it adds to the game instead of feeling like a block from the system? <br/><br/>That block is probably the part that feels the worse, it's not about lethality, about challenges being watered down or not, I'd say that we can all deal with that.

Your character may not have accomplished anything but it either enabled other PCs to do it or paved the way for your next character to try on better conditions.<br/><br/>I was also thinking that the DM may need to establish from the start that game lethality here means that whatever resemblance of a plot in this playstyle doesn't guarantee character survival, and that everyone should be ready to see those stories interrupted. Characters will set their goals but may die on the first step of the adventure. The world will change, the marks of the adventure will remain (<i>there you see the corpse of an unlucky adventurer, devoured by what probably was a bunch of raptors...</i>) but that will be for other adventurers to find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474994/#Comment_474994" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T14:35:51+00:00" title="June 21, 2018  2:35PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What if you as a player could entwine your next character's background with the previous one and make the game more about legacy, so dying becomes a bit less frustrating as it adds to the game instead of feeling like a block from the system? </p></div></blockquote>\nThis is what Pendragon does really well, as I'm sure most of you know.  Even though it's not a high lethality OSR game, it is high lethality if played RAW because damage is `heroic' and healing is really slow and ineffective. Characters can be easily killed, maimed, or lose their minds (if they fail an important passion check) and out of action for the long term.<br/><br/>The game has five "work-arounds" by design. First, characters have families. It's part of the game mechanic. And, characters are expected to die or retire and pass the mantle to their offspring. Second, characters have henchmen (squires/ladies in waiting/apprentices) who can be played as characters if worst-comes-to-worst. Third, characters usually have a demense after a few sessions of play, so there is some continuity there as well. Fourth, characters usually have strong connections to their ethnic group from whence new allied characters can be drawn. And finally, characters usually have passions for other individual NPC (not necessarily cannon NPCs).  Assuming they're not cannon NPCs, these can be played as characters avenging their friends, mates and allies.<br/><br/>It's not 5E or an OSR game, but it covers this kind of unwelcome outcome well, IMHO.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475000/#Comment_475000" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-22T17:42:29+00:00" title="June 22, 2018  5:42PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another GM running Tomb of annihilation uses a stable of characters and experience from exploration, which must be divided among the characters: <a href="https://rollespil.blog/2018/06/22/tomb-of-annihilation-husregel-hexploration/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://rollespil.blog/2018/06/22/tomb-of-annihilation-husregel-hexploration/</a> (in English: <a href="https://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/750/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/750/</a> ).<br/><br/>The writer is also quite good at reporting his campaigns and the reports include both what happens in the fiction and short reflections about how it all is working.

People just think it is because they don't care about the creative priorities that a lethal, neutrally-refereed game has. Virtues like fidelity to the simulation, and legitimacy of the achievement. You are forced to abandon these creative goals/norms if you want to use things like death flags.<br/><br/>To be specific: pointless death is an essential feature if you want to survive pointless death. Pretending to do it is not the same thing as really doing it - if it was, nobody would gamble with real money. I think this is a simple thing to understand even if you don't really get why somebody would want that from their game.<br/><br/>The reverse, of course, also holds: pointless death is a poisonous, primitive gaming tradition if you're a prospective drama gamer stuck in a box with nothing but Mentzer red box and a half dozen hungry geeks for company.<br/><br/>The key to contentment is to pick the right tools for the job, whatever it may be. My in-coming 4th edition campaign does not have pointless death, for instance, because it does not serve the purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475008/#Comment_475008" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-23T18:21:28+00:00" title="June 23, 2018  6:21PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2018 6:23PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has been a really interesting discussion, with lots of excellent points made. I don't have time for a long post, so I'll just leave my initial observation (even though the conversation has long moved on from that point):<br/><br/>I think that D&amp;D5E is very, very poorly calibrated for a "let the dice fall where they may", high lethality game. Character creation is time-consuming, hard work, uninspiring (in the sense that you have to come with a new character concept each time, instead of the game giving you prompts), and designed to build high investment in the character.<br/><br/>In my experience, for most people, that leads to the gaming experience being described here: it just *doesn't feel good* to spend two hours making a character who is presented as a colourful, involved heroic adventurer with lots of exciting powers, carefully-chosen or constructed skill and power sets, and a layered personality, and then lose them in an unlucky series of decisions or die rolls.<br/><br/>Some people could accept that as the cost of the game, and get used to it, but I think for most people it's a terrible match (just based on basic, human preferences for such things). Lengthy, detailed character creation and a gamestyle which occasionally produces character death as an "unwelcome outcome" do NOT play well together.<br/><br/>My experience of D&amp;D tables almost always sees people consciously or unconsciously flinching away from a more "hardcore" playstyle because of the cost of a TPK in actual, human time and emotional investment. This thread is a good example of that: Sandra is doing a remarkable job of not letting all that pressure affect her chosen methods of playing the game, but you can see how heavy that pressure is!<br/><br/>The way character creation sets you up for the game is a really important detail here. How does it orient the players to the game itself? What kind of pressure does it place on the referee?<br/><br/>Part of the fun, I think, in OSR play is the near-infinite possibilities for character concepts (which, in the designs I like, either get thrown at you by random character creation procedures, or can be explored by creative individuals due to gaps in the rules, as Eero likes to encourage - c.f. his <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19959/d-d-5th-the-adventures-of-iron-thomas-the-loco-motif-finished" rel="nofollow">Iron Thomas</a> adventures, where we discuss this very issue).<br/><br/>Some versions of OSR rulesets make character creation fun and easy, and an engaging process to explore. That changes the group's relationship to this kind of outcome dramatically - simply knowing that the game night doesn't need to end, for instance, but can continue in 15 minutes once you make new characters - makes this kind of "tragedy" a very different experience. You have a fun procedure to look forward to, and then you're right back to play.<br/><br/>I've been working on a version of "house ruled" D&amp;D for my own table, and I'm quite happy with the balance I've struck: making a new character is really fun (and most fun when you roll poor stats!), creates unique and unusual character concepts, and tends to inspire unique ideas while being very quick. I like how you basically end up with either a mechanically effective/safe character, or a <i>really interesting</i> one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475012/#Comment_475012" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-23T23:52:13+00:00" title="June 23, 2018 11:52PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Eero, we are using some drama house rules, but they have a minor impact.
