I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E28W_bMBVhg" rel="nofollow">finally found something</a> to add. Sorry I'm not doing necromancy on that old thread tonight, but my mind and body is kinda sore from a full-weekend con I've just came back from.<br/><br/>Ok, probably not all rules pointed here are actually applicable to RPGs but I think that at least the positions 2-10 actually have a great impact on changing our perception on how good a session of our favorites RPGs went. For those who don't want to lose 49 minutes of their lives watching the video (the best stuff begins about minute 10 of the video), basically some of the rules mentioned are:<br/><br/>-Mechanics that allow players with more resources keep gaining even more/better resources<br/>-The reset button (or the mechanic that resets the whole game making everything go back to its starting point)<br/>-Losing a turn<br/>-Drawing tiles from a pouch (after spending time and other resources prepairing, to discover all your efforts come to nothing at all)<br/>-The doom card (or overpowereded unbalancing mechanics that change the whole situation withouth letting it develope into something)<br/>-Mechanics that give players a different number of actions<br/>-Huge and complicated blocks of rules that you have to learn but that will rarely come into play<br/><br/>ok, I'm getting a migrain here so I'm going to bed. Watch the video, you may find a lot more of useful stuff than me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413057/#Comment_413057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T10:10:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 10:10AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game Design Challenge: design a game with four or more of these rules, that is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413058/#Comment_413058" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T10:18:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 10:18AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, Ben.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CitizenKeen" title="CitizenKeen"><img alt="CitizenKeen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CitizenKeen">CitizenKeen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413059/#Comment_413059" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T10:33:05+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 10:33AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a board game standpoint, I would argue <i>Eclipse</i> actually hits three or four of those (depending on how "huge and complicated" the blocks of rules are.<br/><br/>I would agree there is some benefit to realizing that board game experience can influence us in the role playing game design experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413062/#Comment_413062" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T10:40:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 10:40AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>-Mechanics that allow players with more resources keep gaining even more/better resources<br/></blockquote>\nThis is just a <a href="http://tech-lib.net/Rules%20Of%20Play%20Game%20Design%20Fundamentals%20Ebook/Elements%20of%20a%20Cybernetic%20System/2" rel="nofollow">positive cybernetic feedback loop</a>, and it's a game design tool like any other game design tool.

We'd play for a while, and invariably someone would shout, "Okay, THIS round is for Champion of the Universe," or something. It would negate everything that came before it, but it made the game exciting: it's all on the line, now! If you were losing, you have a chance, and if you were winning, well, prove it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a stellar tool, but it has its uses. Maybe it gets used in those party games because they were poorly designed party games and people could find themselves out of the game before the end. Maybe there's a better fix that a designer with knowledge and experience could bring to bear, but don't discount the "non-gamer's" intuitive use of game design tools.<br/><br/>This might be a good tool to use in games with low investment, where, paradoxically, you are designing the game to work in a space where otherwise paying attention to the rules of the game is not a high priority (i.e., it doesn't really matter who wins, we're just playing Charades and getting drunk, but we reset towards the end to create an exciting finish).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413071/#Comment_413071" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T11:26:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 11:26AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is (1) a very bad mechanic, and (2) one that a lot of (non-gamer) people want to inject into all party games.

It limits the effect of tactics and gives everyone a chance to win in the last phase, which is something that a lot of people (gamers or not) want out of games.  This can be a problem if you want the game to be a pure test of skill, but many people don't want that.  <br/><br/>A lot of people are dissatisfied with, say, playing on for many turns in a board game after it becomes clear that it is impossible for them to win.  The reset is one approach that keeps things interesting.  <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, resting to heal up and recharge has a similar function.  This means that players can set their own pace relative to their skill.  If the players are skilled and confident, they can take on more each day - while if they are struggling, they can take less each day.  If you take this away, then you may end up with a lot more situations where the players can see in advance that they are doomed because they are too low on everything, and they are all killed off or have to abandon the adventure.  This might be more tactically rigorous, but it isn't necessarily more fun as a social activity.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413079/#Comment_413079" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T12:33:25+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 12:33PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 12:33PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans-co nailed it with the positive cybernetic feedback loop and added the part missing to make it an awful rule, which otherwise is valid. \n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>-Drawing tiles from a pouch (after spending time and other resources prepairing, to discover all your efforts come to nothing at all)</blockquote>\nI may watch the video, but can you expand on this?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nIt's more like "preparing a complicate move or putting special effort at introducing something in the fiction and have absolutely no reaction because of stupid rules"<br/><br/>I'd say the reset button rule becomes really annoying when, let's say, you've been fighting the final boss for a whole session only to find out it comes equipped with an special power that brings it back to life and restores all his HP and other resources. And it does such in a way that ostensibly makes it look like all those hours of tactical planing and heroic sacrifices didn't meant absolutely nothing in the fiction. One thing is to play with a douchebag GM and another to find a rule that makes an otherwise good GM into a douchebag.

"We just spent two hours playing charades and having fun! And now all bets are off! Yay!"<br/><br/>Because in the Party Game Reset situation, the types of rewards players were seeking from playing the game were different from the types of rewards that the Boss Reset players are looking for. Party Gamers just want to bullshit with their friends, and the game structures that. Boss Fighters want to engage deeply with a game system which will provide satisfaction in itself.<br/><br/>So, actually, the real question is: Would a Reset interfere with the primary reward players are looking for from this game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413094/#Comment_413094" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T13:51:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  1:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 1:52PM by timonkey.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, maybe there's space for only-last-round counts mechanics.  I'll discount kids sports as being a totally separate type of thing, though.<br/><br/>I could have some transference issues, as in my experience playing party games like charades or pictionary with large groups is a waste of everyone's time and I loathe them.  Also, when I've seen it used in that case, it was a bad use of the rule for two reasons: (1) it created disengagement during early rounds because everyone knows it doesn't count, and (2) the number of people involved in what counts is very small (one person drawing per team).  Also, I understand just playing charades for fun.  I'd be much happier in these situations if we just played a bunch and didn't keep score.  If we're going to have a winner, I want robust scoring mechanics.  <br/><br/>Also, thanks Hans for framing more for those with more as a positive feedback loop.  Feedback loops are an incredibly powerful way to look at games, especially if you've already studies them in other contexts.  \n<blockquote>A lot of people are dissatisfied with, say, playing on for many turns in a board game after it becomes clear that it is impossible for them to win.  The reset is one approach that keeps things interesting.</blockquote>\nI don't think trading one bad mechanic for another is good design.  I think better solutions include: player elimination, positive feedback loops that trigger the end of the game, and escalating stakes (e.g. Jeopardy!).\n<blockquote><br/>In the Boss Reset situation, it certainly does. "We just two hours working on this dragon, and it was all for shit! Our choices didn't matter!"<br/></blockquote>\nActually, I think this is kind of legit.

For some reason, the more drawn out a basic die roll is, the more likely the game will have you make dozens of rolls to see if anything happens.

Also, when I've seen it used in that case, it was a bad use of the rule for two reasons: (1) it created disengagement during early rounds because everyone knows it doesn't count, and (2) the number of people involved in what counts is very small (one person drawing per team).  Also, I understand just playing charades for fun.  I'd be much happier in these situations if we just played a bunch and didn't keep score.  If we're going to have a winner, I want robust scoring mechanics.</blockquote>\nI think this is a totally legitimate preference, and my preference is similar.  However, not everyone sees it this way.  Some people genuinely prefer to reset rather than either of just playing for fun or a continuous scoring mechanic.  I don't think it is helpful to say that they are objectively wrong.  Instead, it should be seen as <br/><br/>I think a lot of this has to do with expectations.  For example, I will often play ping-pong by playing a series of unscored matches for a while - then towards the end we would play one scored game.  This has the same feature that none of the earlier victories mattered for the final victory, but the earlier games were still viewed as significant.  If I knew that a reset was going to happen, then objectively the games before the reset are equivalent to these practice games.  However, that doesn't mean I will feel that way.  <br/><br/>Likewise, there is a potential difference in play between fighting a 50 hit point enemy who resets a single time when he hits zero hit points, compared to fighting a 100 hit point enemy.  These are mathematically equivalent. Still, depending on the circumstances, some people may see the fight before the reset as negating their input.  <br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote>A lot of people are dissatisfied with, say, playing on for many turns in a board game after it becomes clear that it is impossible for them to win.  The reset is one approach that keeps things interesting.</blockquote>\nI don't think trading one bad mechanic for another is good design.  I think better solutions include: player elimination, positive feedback loops that trigger the end of the game, and escalating stakes (e.g. Jeopardy!).</blockquote>\nI think all of these are good, but I still think that even offered these options, some people will prefer a reset.  For example, player elimination strongly affects the social circumstances of play which may not be desired.  Similarly, escalating stakes are more complicated.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413178/#Comment_413178" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T06:50:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  6:50AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Game Design Challenge: design a game with four or more of these rules, that is fun.</blockquote>\nHMMMM.<br/><br/>My own hat into the ring: the idea of "save or die" effects, where a simple random roll lies between you and disaster, absent other context.
