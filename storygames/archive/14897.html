Basically, you play a science fiction author in the 1970s (like Philip K. Dick) who's also a character in a novel being written by your friends - and your friend is screwing up your already difficult creative and family life by introducing weird plot twists to make their novel more exciting.<br/><br/>(Here's <a href="1km1kt.net/rpg/left-coast" rel="nofollow">the latest version of Left Coast</a>. I wrote an intro to the game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14472&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>It was the first time I've run the new version of the game, and a few people have been circling around playtesting it, wondering if it works or if it's broken. The playtest was cool and I was happy with the results: Within about 30 minutes, Mike and I had created our two science fiction authors (J. Oberon Eldritch and Robert M. Curtis) and surrounded them with a cast of characters that very naturally led into two very different types of story: <br/><br/><hr/><br/><i>J. Oberon Eldritch</i><br/>Oberon\u2019s story was caught in the middle of kitchen-sink realism meets <br/>LSD-induced enlightenment. He was simultaneously a bum who was <br/>crashing at his brother's house, while also leading a group of occultists <br/>and university professors in the consumption of drugs. Oberon was trying <br/>to open his mind up to a higher plane of reality and (hopefully) understand<br/>what the Psychic Voice in his head was telling him. <br/><br/>For me, the highlight of Oberon\u2019s story was seeing him arguing with his <br/>straight-arrow banker brother, trying to scam $5 off him to afford postage <br/>to send off his manuscript. The amount of venom and resentment that <br/>came out of that simple conversation was pretty amazing.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><i>Robert M. Curtis</i><br/>Bob Curtis becoming enmeshed in a paranoid noir where his parole officer <br/>was blackmailing him for money and Bob's doppleganger seemed to be <br/>planning a crime to frame Bob and put him put back behind bars.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>We played through three rounds of scenes:<br/><br/>- Bob meets Patricia Pennington, his new neighbour who seems to be spying on him.<br/>- Oberon tries to scam five bucks off his brother.<br/>- Bob\u2019s parole officer, Michael Gleisner, confronts him at the diner where Bob works.<br/>- Oberon invites his friends and associates around to his brother\u2019s house to take drugs, while his brother invites his boss from the bank home for dinner.<br/>- Oberon writes a story about the Vietnam war spreading across the planet. The story is set in Southern California, and one of the characters is heavily based on Oberon\u2019s brother<br/>- Bob and Oberon meet up for a drink at a science-fiction convention, and learn more about each other\u2019s frustrating lives.<br/><br/>In terms of the rules, that was three Widescreen scenes, a Family scene, a Money scene, and an Ensemble scene.<br/><br/>(Mike's take on the session is <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=337404" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/><br/><b>So here\u2019s what I thought worked:</b><br/><br/>Making up non-player characters (NPCs) really worked for me. It asks just enough questions to give the NPCs an attitude and an initial spark of life. As a result I found them easy to play in scenes. I\u2019d be interested in how Mike found it. I also found it really satisfying to get to know the NPCs through conversation. I enjoyed the process of slowly figuring out what they really wanted and what they were willing to resist or insist on.<br/><br/>The process for introducing \u2018Weird\u2019 elements into the game (at least in the first few scenes we played out) seemed to work really well.<br/><br/>And best of all, I just enjoyed exploring the setting and the characters. Through play, I became interested in the characters who were being talked about but who hadn\u2019t been seen yet. For instance, I started the game being afraid of my parole officer and then realised I absolutely needed to have a scene with him.<br/><br/>I also ended up being really curious about what was going on with all the other NPCs in both stories: Oberon\u2019s father; the university professor using Oberon\u2019s drugs; Bob\u2019s ex-cellmate Kenny; my ex-wife new husband (the insurance investigator).<br/><br/><br/><b>What needed work?</b><br/><br/>I think there\u2019s lots of stuff I need to tweak and lots of procedures I need to simplify or cull, but the game's basic structure seems sound. Now I\u2019m getting ready for a second, more extensive playtest, and trying to figure out how to present the rules more effectively, in a way that inspires people to want to play it (I've got a thread about that and the tweaks I think I need to make over at the Forge: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31832.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>During this next playtest I want to play through one or two chapters and take the game out for a real road test to see:<br/><br/>- what happens when you hit 7 on the Story rating and end a chapter?<br/>- whether all the types of reset scenes work?<br/>- what the game's like when you get into lots and lots of conflicts?<br/><br/>The goal is to get a new draft together that's massively simplified: more focused on the bare-bones of the procedures you need to play. (At the moment, there\u2019s lots of editorial direction, and I\u2019ve tried to cram EVERYTHING in the rules.)<br/><br/>(Here's <a href="1km1kt.net/rpg/left-coast" rel="nofollow">the latest version of Left Coast</a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338558/#Comment_338558" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T02:25:18+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  2:25AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the NPCs, I agree. You've got just enough there to play the character with a bit of spark. It's nice to be able to defer some of the decisions until after the first scene or two if nothing comes to mind as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
