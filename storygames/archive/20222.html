There are some pre-scripted moments but there's also a huge sandbox to explore as you wish.<br/>The two players who were most requesting a prewritten story-line and pre-set goals have been the most disruptive. Go figure. One immediately said "I want to make an evil character" and I answered "that would've been great in the LAST campaign, but here... I'm fine with it, but I don't think you'll get the most out of it." The other... PotA starts out with a list of side-quests that players can choose from or roll randomly. This other player, who had been the MOST advocating for clear goals and a clear pre-written story, started seeking out the easiest and the most "on-the-way" sidequest, which took a while to find, and then he immediately forgot about it anyway (I could've written it down, but...).<br/><br/>That said, PotA has been sandboxy enough to handle this and both their shenanigans.<br/>I've been running pretty easy on the faction stuff and mostly doing pure exploration.<br/>The biggest problem with the campaign so far has been my own lack of preparation. The book is just so complex and so hard to use. It's written to be a great READ, but it's not good to use at the table. I've read it three or four times but I still have a hard time finding what I want.<br/>It's really poorly referenced, things are described briefly in one chapter, in more detail in further chapters but no page reference between them. A tiny bit of information can be really hard to find since it can be in one of like six or seven places in the book.<br/>The book is organized "temporally" (like, in what order it could happen in "an ideal" campaign) while the contents seem to make more sense had they been organized "spatially". And written more briefly, more like an outline or graph than a prose text document.<br/>That's my wish.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445816/#Comment_445816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-27T13:13:25+00:00" title="June 27, 2015  1:13PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The take-away for me is that I should be running very sandboxy sandboxes where I can let the players run loose, for that is what they want to do even when they say they want more goals!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445817/#Comment_445817" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-27T17:20:54+00:00" title="June 27, 2015  5:20PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2015 5:21PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's really poorly referenced, things are described briefly in one chapter, in more detail in further chapters but no page reference between them.

It's called The Dead Forest, and has an encounter with a black knight that I talked about a lot in another thread. The text in this specific encounter says that the knight is a servant of Sathmog, and that Sathmog is the god of ill will, darkness, death, and the eternal fire. It turns out he's mentioned more in the second supplement and a lot more in the third, but when I ran the encounter I hadn't read that far ahead.<br/><br/>What I'll do now, and what may be helpful for you if you like to have things organized the same way I do, is to start a Google doc with headings like "Sathmog" or "Black Knight" where I put the most important stuff about them. Now that you mention it, I should put page references to the modules in there as well for more information.<br/><br/>I don't like to do this kind of prep, as I don't want to spend too much time with the game away from the table. I want for this campaign for the players to show up and roll some dice and for me to read off dungeon keys. But I realize that these three modules require me to do some organizing of my own for them to run smoothly at the table. I think a couple of words under each heading will be enough for me to quickly refresh stuff as we encounter them during play.<br/><br/>Will you create your own outline or graph, or is it something you're not interested in doing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445818/#Comment_445818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-27T17:27:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2015  5:27PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D\xf6da Skogen ftw.

It would've been easier if PotA had been digital, I could cut and paste stuff.<br/>But I've been spoiled with easy-to-run stuff from the OSR.\n<blockquote>I want for this campaign for the players to show up and roll some dice and for me to read off dungeon keys.</blockquote>\nYeah, I love that. I don't want to read boxed text, I want to see what's in the room and find my own way to say it. But I've seen some one-page dungeons that have been like that -- and of course, any dungeons I make myself.<br/>Truly, making your own dungeons is usually faster than using a big book like Princes of the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>That said, I love Aerisi, Vanifer, Thurl and the rest of the gang. It's a very cozy setting and set of characters and places. It's just hard to use right, it's still good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445836/#Comment_445836" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T03:03:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  3:03AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible to take some of the elements from a module like that and translate them into a barebones-module, like some of the things we've seen on S-G lately (or Ghost/Echo)?

The adventure's setup is good enough (you can go to a bunch of locations in any order etc). Sort of a compromise between a sandbox and an anti-sandbox.<br/>But it's pretty hard to extract the information you need from the text.<br/>I'm learning a lot by attempting to run it. I know how I'm gonna need to prep for the next campaign.
