It uses a relationship-map as its board, whereon players move node to node, starting wars, building trade, becoming the leaders or reviled enemies of factions, and writing vignette stories as they go. It's played in rounds, where players influence nodes and move between them, and then a maintenance phase takes place for the nodes to take some actions (run by a moderator [me] in our game). So far, it's pretty fun - you can read the game so far <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=113" rel="nofollow">over on Snail's Pace</a>. There's a <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=114" rel="nofollow">rules thread too</a>, in case you have questions or suggestions. Ideally this'll develop into an easily-playable, adaptable play-by-forum system for handling a variety of stories, like:<br/><br/>- An LA crime game where players manipulate the various ethnic gangs, the police, the feds, etc.<br/>- Europe 1912, the lead up to the Great War, where factions are countries<br/>- Star Wars: Knights of the Republic era, where factions are worlds<br/>- A planescape campaign using all those factions in Sigil. Yes, Judd, there will be githyanki.<br/>- Probably lots of other places and times. It plays best in environments that would otherwise be hard for everyone to keep track of all the people and players.<br/><br/><br/><b>Background</b>: While living an ocean away from them, I started running a D&amp;D4E campaign via Skype and Maptool for my old crew. We weren't going to be able to game regularly for a couple of months, but I wanted a way for the characters and stories to develop. We had already agreed it would be a change of setting and that some in-game time would pass. We were nominally set in the Forgotten Realms, and decided the Jungles of Chult would be where the game picked up. I started researching all the literature I could find in various editions of supplements on the place, and began to make a relationship map of who all the factions and political powers were on Chult in order to come up with stuff for the game. I turned to an <a href="http://www.roleplayingtips.com/readissue.php?number=272#R1" rel="nofollow">old method of mine</a> to assign some random values to how well the factions were doing and how much or little they liked each other. It looked something like the map shown in the next post.<br/><br/><br/>The more I looked at it, the more I wanted to play a political game with it as the board instead of just feebly applying it to the tactical combat game that is 4E D&amp;D. So I made up some rules and so far they seem to be working pretty well. The characters were preexisting and much of the lore about the factions started with what was already written in supplements. I don't know how it would do if you populated a map where all you gave was <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Secret_Society_Name" rel="nofollow">interesting faction names</a> with no background information, but it'd be interesting to try.<br/><br/>I know there are some unadressed issues/holes in the rules that'll need to be dealt with. But so far it's pretty fun, and I thought maybe I'd throw it out there in case anyone else needs a game like that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223464/#Comment_223464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T15:58:19+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  3:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2009 3:58PM by Dave Younce.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My original faction map:<br/><a href="http://s968.photobucket.com/albums/ae162/foucalt/?action=view&amp;current=chult_original.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="chult_original_map" src="http://i968.photobucket.com/albums/ae162/foucalt/chult_original.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>The current map:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1766237/M.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223466/#Comment_223466" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T16:26:28+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  4:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very cool, Dave.

I have been working feverishly on a play-by-forum/wiki world-building design for about a month that has factions and such.  Most of the other game design ideas I've had over the last few years, I've thought, "that's cool, but is it really necessary? I could do that with FATE, or X or Y and I'd rather just hack those to get what I want."  But I've been really enthusiastic about the idea of a "story game" style game that takes advantage of some of the things a forum/wiki could provide because I've never seen a game yet that attempts that.  But maybe I'm just not aware of them yet\u2026<br/><br/>This looks very cool, Dave.  I don't know if I have the courage to go look at your rules though.  I was working on something very like Universalis for over a year and then read Universalis\u2026<br/><br/>My current direction is heavily influenced by Universalis along with all the play-by-mail games I was participating in in the early/mid-eighties.  Where you have "orders" and get outputs and all the objects you interact with have stuff attached to them that looks like string code.  The fun world-building parts of games like Shock and Mortal Coil and How To Host a Dungeon are my other main influences along with Sid Meier's Civilization, Dictionary of Mu, Aria, Puerto Rico, Ursuppe, and some "fractal" Fate stuff that's been floating around out there for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223670/#Comment_223670" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T10:31:23+00:00" title="August 10, 2009 10:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite> It plays best in environments that would otherwise be hard for everyone to keep track of all the people and players.</blockquote>\nThis was my main catalyst for moving forward with this too - to really take advantage of a format where people could see the states of different objects in the game, however complicated, reflect on them, and then act to change the states of those objects using resources they'd garnered from previous conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223701/#Comment_223701" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T12:54:35+00:00" title="August 10, 2009 12:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I like how your map is vaguely geographical.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's intentional both because factions near each other relate to each other and to give the players a chance to incorporate physical travel right along with node travel. You could even name paths, like "Caverns of Moria" or "Khyber Pass" where appropriate.  After SG-Boston's awesome 40K adaptation of 1001 Nights, I'd be interested in seeing a version of something like this steeped in 40K lore (which I know relatively little about but still find fascinating).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Does this also serve to sort of raise player flags about what interests them, or is it a strictly tactical exercise?  Did anybody see the map and say "The Wild Dwarves must be mine!" or did they approach it more like a board game?</blockquote>\nWe've seen both. I think all players immediately saw nodes that interested them - Rich wanted to identify with the Chultans and free them from colonial powers, Wam wants to raise a pirate army, and Clinton identified with the Batiri Goblins and wants to rid the land of the influence of the Lich King. Once they all had those rough first goals in mind, they set about working it like a board game with varying degrees of success. Rich has always been a system-exploiter: in D&amp;D he immediately sees how to make rules work for his benefit, and so strategies have very easily popped out at him (the rules don't always back him up, but that confusion will pass). Rich sees the control of nodes as a definite means to his ends, and so he immediately set about towards putting the most powerful nodes under his control. Clinton and Wam have so-far been more about making their turns accomplish what they want to see in the fiction than in investing in power on the gameboard. Those two things are linked, but loosely depending on how much power you need on the gameboard to accomplish what you want storywise.  I think it can accomodate both styles, but in the long run the other players may find themselves at a disadvantage if they want to accomplish something Rich and his power-nodes don't want to let happen. <br/><br/>As for flags beyond this game, one of my goals was to give the players a reason to care about and an ability to affect the factions that we'll have available to us after this game when we switch back to D&amp;D4E. The characters are currently 10th level in that game (we cheat and level up every session no matter what because nobody likes tracking experience and we only play ~1/month). I remember keenly from early D&amp;D games that 10th level characters were a big deal with castles and followers and such, but whenever I would play a 10th level dude he was just another sword-swinger fighting slightly tougher monsters, not usually playing at any kind of political level. So I wanted to take a break at 10th level and establish some stories about who the characters were in the world beyond pre-1st-level backstories, but at a quicker and more interesting pace than is usually possible in D&amp;D's mechanics. After this we'll switch back to D&amp;D and each player will name some 1-2 session arcs they're interested in from the game. Perhaps the Lich King will escape into the Underdark and the players, led by Clinton/Moro's thirst for his destruction, will pursue him. That can be played at the D&amp;D level. Perhaps a final peace between the Batiri Goblins and the Chultan tribesmen will elude the game, and the players will want to ''zoom in' and roleplay that out over Skype. We'll rotate around hitting flags established in this game for a few levels in our drifted D&amp;D, and then when players reach level 20 in D&amp;D maybe we'll have another round of Webwinding where they'll play with larger groups in more powerful parts of Faerun, pitting kingdoms and empires against elder evils - because that's how cool 20th level characters ought to be. Then we'll 'zoom in' on some of those conflicts and play them out with tactical D&amp;D battles. At least, that's the current thinking. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I was working on something very like Universalis for over a year and then read Universalis\u2026</blockquote>\nParts of this do resemble Universalis (which I read a few years ago but have never actually played), but I think this system is simpler and will play better on forums. Less things are tracked with currency than in Universalis - it depends instead in this case on preexisting lore than on defining traits with currency and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223715/#Comment_223715" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T13:43:22+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  1:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>As for flags beyond this game, one of my goals was to give the players a reason to care about and an ability to affect the factions that we'll have available to us after this game when we switch back to D&amp;D4E.

At first blush, I think you could use most of Webwinding as a basis for City by the Sea, you'd just have to have more of it take place by email/whispers and keep the numbers on the map GM-only, and do the players' rolls for them. I'm not personally a fan of player-obfuscation, but I do see that it would enforce intrigue and mystery that my player-transparent game might lack.  It sounds rather GM-work-heavy, but I think it could be done and I agree with Bill that you don't need very much of the extra weight of the various attributes; instead you can do the kinds of Particular Strengths that he's talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223757/#Comment_223757" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T15:32:42+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  3:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Brian, I'll check that thread out.  Hopefully I'll have something to share not too far in the future, as Dave has done (and is playing!).  My design, like my writing process, requires me to make a grossly bloated and over-complicated game and then cut and cut and cut until I'm not too filled with shame to expose it to the light of day.  Even though the core mechanics I'm playing with are relatively simple I think I need a lot of forum protocol and some examples written down to be able to start the testing I want to do (I may also need Google Wave to be further developed before my game can exist as I'm envisioning it, but that's not going to slow me for now).<br/><br/>I'm going to hold off at least a week before checking out webwinding but I have two questions on this topic, either for Dave or for others who've played around with this kind of game.<br/><br/>1) What's your preferred online die roller and what ones, if any, offer useful integration features with wiki or forum mediums?<br/><br/>2) How do/might you tackle the design challenge of wanting people to be able to push "their part" of the story forward as far as they can go without stepping on the toes of other participants while also preventing the game from moving too slowly and/or the fiction from being too fragmentary?  All the pbp games I've been in have often been in two alternate modes: mechanic-free open roleplaying where conflict is either explicitly or socially off limits, and then fighty-mode conflicts (sometimes with maps), a mode that brings the narrative to an absolute crawl.  <br/><br/>But to integrate conflict resolution into human scale scenes during pbp?  I know it's done all the time.  I just don't think any of the solutions I've seen to this point are satisfactory.  I don't know that I can do better but I intend to try.  Ideally I want the person that's eager to create objects and crash them into each other to get what they want and I want the person who goes on vacation for a week to not have their agency repeatedly stabbed.  They'd both have a pretty different experience of the game, but they should both be able to have fun.<br/><br/>I may need to end up abandoning the human scale narrative part of my game and just go forward with a world-builder-toy-for-demi-gods-mode, and that would be fine too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223772/#Comment_223772" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T16:14:18+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  4:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Simon has installed <a href="http://vanillaforums.org/addon/155/DiceRoller" rel="nofollow">the DiceRoller add-on</a> for Vanilla, and that works fine. You roll your dice in one post and then can see them, and editing of the rolling post is disabled. It's handy and works in-line nicely.<br/><br/>2) In our game player-player conflict is neither off-limits nor handled at a map-fighty-mode level. Player characters themselves do not (presently) have their own lives on the line, but the mechanics decide just how much damage they can do both to factions other characters care about and to the players' relationships to those factions. Maybe that won't fit what you're looking for, but I didn't find it all that tricky to come up with a mechanic that encourages players towards eventual conflict in a way that I wanted. Hopefully you'll be able to do the same in your game. To avoid anyone getting too much say, we play in rounds where everyone gets a single turn, in whatever order, and then some maintenance happens by me and a new round is declared. We've decided that anyone who doesn't post for 3 days, the game moves on without their turn. But that would obviously have to vary by group and circumstance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich" title="Rich"><img alt="Rich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.escapecodes.info/images/162.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich">Rich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223846/#Comment_223846" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T20:59:17+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  8:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2009 8:38AM by Rich.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite> Rich has always been a system-exploiter: in D&amp;D he immediately sees how to make rules work for his benefit, and so strategies have very easily popped out at him</blockquote>\nIt's a gift.<br/><br/>To answer Jason's question, though, I think for me it started heavily on the story side (to where I was making terrible tactical decisions).  Once I realized what I wanted to do with the story, my instinct to rapidly consolidate enough power (in business we call it "generating team buy-in", but it works pretty much the same as controlling nodes and relationships) to successfully execute that plan kicked in, then it became a more even mix of story and gameplay.  <br/><br/>Dave will also tell you I'm a heavy defense player, so it's definitely not my nature to play a risky game with my goals when there are ways to accomplish them that are heavily skewed in my favor.  Tactical alliances and the extra die that node-control provides definitely bring that advantage, which I think is the point of the game (perhaps not to the extent I took it).  <br/><br/>In 20 years of D&amp;D I've carted around I-can't-begin-to-tell-you numbers of potions I've never used, just because I might need them.  This type of game, for me as a player, represents the same type of thing, where I could toe-dip in relationships all over Chult and build an array of options for later.  When we kick back into micro-level play, that will provide the DM with abundant story options as well.<br/><br/>I think that answers the question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224298/#Comment_224298" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T13:03:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  1:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton is getting pwnd by the Lich King.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224306/#Comment_224306" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T13:14:33+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  1:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>Clinton is getting pwnd by the Lich King.</blockquote>\nWebwinding was cool until they totally made it like WoW...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224324/#Comment_224324" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T14:00:07+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  2:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am getting pwned all ways.
