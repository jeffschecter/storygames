GUMSHOE is going to be the engine for Ken Hite's newest version of Call of Cthulhu.  I like what Robin does here but I see a lot of companies going in the same direction.  My impression is that many companies are going in the direction of "give GMs tools to run games and lead their players through THEIR plots."  I think it's a great step in a traditional framework and I admit I am a solid convert to hippy games but I do wonder if the direction even further AWAY from player input is a pointed decision to distance themselves from many of the games I play (tMW, PTA, even BW/BE) or a move closer to the "GM is god" model.  I know Mr. Laws is familiar with player driven games and more spontaneous storytelling.  I have considered making a comment on his livejournal to find out his take on it all.<br/><br/>Has anyone else read Esoterrorists or GUMSHOE.  After putting myself into a traditional mindset I decided that I really did like the approach and the system (and Esoterrorists is a interesting and direct setting).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65041/#Comment_65041" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T12:39:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 12:39PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            did you read the "page XX." columns RDL wrote about adventure design for Esoterrorists/GUMSHOE?

It does help the percpetion and it shows that Robin is very aware of the ideas presented by this and other communities.  I have always designed scenarios around player skills.  Many of my players accused me of being overly controlling because I collected character sheets between games.  This was because I would find ways to push character buttons and it's harder to do without looking at the characters.<br/><br/>So the question becomes "Is this a rough enough story structure to be more akin to something like town development in DitV?"<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Laws isn't the only one going in this direction.

Inspectres typifies this approach.  That's fine, but for many folk looking to play mysteries fundamentally misses the point as they want an actual mystery with a real solution capable of unravelling.<br/><br/>The second approach is to have an actual mystery with a real solution capable of unravelling.  CoC traditionally typifies this approach.<br/><br/>That second approach necessitates a clear GM/Player split.  It's integral to the existence of a mystery which is unravelled in play that someone creates and knows the truth to that mystery and others discover it.  I'm not saying that's better or worse, but it is what this play is about.  Co-creation is directly incompatible with discovery of the mystery.<br/><br/>Historically however, techniques for facilitating this play have not been good.  One common problem, particularly in published CoC scenarios, is the one roll blocks the investigation issue.  PCs have to discover a single clue and if they don't the investigation stalls, the mystery is not solved, the players do not find out what was happening through their own efforts.<br/><br/>There are a number of ways round that, but one way is the method used in Gumshoe.  Gumshoe is about structuring a system explicitly enabling GMs to successfully run games in which there is an actual mystery with a real solution capable of unravelling while avoiding the possibility of a sudden blockage destroying the game.<br/><br/>It's not really about GM as god or about new ways of doing gaming, it's about providing tools to faciliate a particular type of rpg experience.  It is quite explicitly not about railroading, the fact the GM creates the underlying truth of the mystery in no way requires that the GM tell the players a story in which they are along for the ride and Esoterrorists tries to provide tools to prevent that occurring, though the example scenario in the book I think fails in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65191/#Comment_65191" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T02:09:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  2:09AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>On the other hand Mr. Laws isn't the only one going in this direction.

The White Wolf thing is different, and IMO sounds deeply problematic.<br/><br/>It may not actually be problematic, but all kinds of alarm bells go off in my head when I hear people talking about making GMs better storytellers, the job of the GM is not storytelling, the players are not the audience.  Gumshoe does not make that mistake though, White Wolf may but Gumshoe is doing something different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65202/#Comment_65202" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T05:05:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  5:05AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

The first is to basically do something like the game Clue does (I believe that they call it Cluedo on your side of the pond?). Where the solution is determined randomly, and some mechanical method for determining it exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn an entirely different tangent, I think that there's a problem with the dichotomy that you're setting up, in that there are probably a lot of other ways to approach mysteries. That is, the COC/Essoterrorist method is not only to have a mystery with a solution to it pre-existing. But, and I think this is very important, the path to the solution of the mystery is pre-determined. One can also imagine, for instance, having the mystery's solution pre-determined... we know whodunnit... but not how the players are going to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "problem" being solved by Essoterrorists (I've read it), is the one you identify - not being able to get to the end of the mystery without throwing out most of the mechanics anyhow. I think it's found a way to succeed at that, largely. But even there, and to me quite ironically, it allows the "quest" to fail on combat. That is, for some reason it's OK to allow automatic success on getting from scene to scene... unless you get killed in the process. I'm pretty sure that's an accurate reading of the rules. In fact, it goes so far to explain that this is neccessary in order to have some sort of tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is fascinating. Apparently figuring out how to get from scene to scene can be done with automatic success, and is still interesting, but getting through a combat with automatic success is not. It seems that some traditions are inviolate...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, again, there's another model that would work here, which would be to allow the players to indicate the path in collaboration with the GM. That is, they come up with what the scenes are, but the narrator figures out how to ensure that some clue shows up that leads to the solution of the mystery. I think Laws even mentions this as a possibility for super-GMs. I think, with the right mechanical rules, it would be possible for any GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, do I see this method as superior? Well, the "problem" with COC scenarios, as I see it, is not only that they tend to not get to the end of the mystery. That's one problem, certainly. But the other issue is that in stringing the players along from scene to scene, the players tend to have very little input. They are not solving the mystery, they are just following the script already set for the characters to solve the mystey. In Gumshoe this is, if anything, more true. With COC, at least you had those occasions where the players would fail, and the intrepid GM would take some cue from the players on where to go next, and figure out how to bring them back on track. Yeah that's a lot of work without support, and you get illusionism problems, perhaps. But at least the players get to actually participate in creating the plot through the declared actions of their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I'm fond of saying, in looking at what makes a game fun for the players, determine what decisions it is that they have to make. In almost all RPGs it's going to be possible for them to at least create "window dressing" in terms of their narrations, and such. But what Steve is calling structure can, for some players, tends to not be enough. They want to have an effect on whet he's calling the framework. If, in fact, they're being lead by the nose from scene to scene, then they feel that they aren't really controlling anything important. Certainly not their character's destinies in any appreciable fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least in D&amp;D; you could decide to go left or right at the T-shaped intersection.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe this is my own proclivities speaking. I'm sure that some people will be delighted by the solutions that Gumshoe provides. It won't, for me however, solve all the problems of COC. I think that Don's concern is quite a valid one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65226/#Comment_65226" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T06:46:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  6:46AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gumshoe is not supposed to have a predetermined path, the idea is that there are clues in existence but that the PCs can determine how they approach things and which avenues they follow.  The example adventure is railroady, but that's the example adventure, the game is pretty clear that the path is not laid down in advance.<br><br>Personally I think the problem it seeks to address is a non-problem anyway, or more accurately a problem of shitty GMing and scenario design, in that I routinely run mystery/investigation games in which I in no way prejudge what the PCs will do and in which there is never a single roll that blocks the game.  I see game blocking rolls all the time in published CoC scenarios, but not in my own actual play.<br><br>The combat bit, sure, but the game isn't seeking to avoid failure, the game is seeking to address precisely one issue - an investigation stalling because a clue is necessary to progress and is dependent on a single roll.  That's it, the game is addressing that point and no other.  I don't think it's a point that needs a mechanical fix, but that's why it doesn't avoid possible failure via combat or by some other means (running out of time for example).  Guaranteed success is not a goal of the game.<br><br>But led by the nose from scene to scene?  That's not something necessarily present in Esoterrorists, I believe the text (I'm selling my copy so it's in a box right now and I can't check) explicitly speaks to that point and does not recommend forcing players down one path, and there is absolutely nothing in an investigation game that requires that kind of channelling.<br><br>Anyway, that's the key point here, Esoterrorists and Gumshoe do not in fact assume a predetermined investigation path, that's not actually correct. They only assume a predetermined answer, how you get there is open.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65231/#Comment_65231" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T06:55:32+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  6:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>That aside, again, there's another model that would work here, which would be to allow the players to indicate the path in collaboration with the GM.

Certainly when I play games like this I don't want the clue to move about for me to find it whatever I choose to do, because that renders my choices essentially meaningless.<br><br>The freedom to fail is integral to this kind of game, take that out and I think you have a very different animal.  Possibly an animal you might prefer, but I think it's important not to fall into the cats suck because they're not dogs fallacy.<br><br>Games with GMs as determinants of truth within the world need not fall into either the GM moving clues in front of the players or the GM channelling their players down predetermined routes.  There are other, far more player empowering, options out there that a lot of people routinely use.<br><br>My problem with Esoterrorists is that I think it tries to apply a mechanical solution to a narrow issue caused by poor GM advice and some dreadful published CoC scenarios and that it has a peculiar dichotomy between skill use and combat that I'm not sure (like you here) is remotely necessary.  I'm keen to see Ken's version, because I don't really see Esoterrorists as a success, but the game is not intended to make the rails on the road smoother.  It has faults, but that's not one of them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65233/#Comment_65233" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T07:03:14+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  7:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another point on Esoterrorists which is interesting, the players must have between them all the skills in the game.<br><br>I thought that interesting, but again disempowering.  It means that we will always discover the clues, but as Mike notes that means we can only fail if we proceed too slowly or if we get killed.  That seems a bit odd and in a way means my choices as a player matter less, because I can't for example make poor skill choices.  Of course, it's because the game is only addressing that one failed skill roll blockage issue and is otherwise fine with failure, but it leads to an odd outcome.<br><br>Nor can I be made to improvise to cope with a situation because I lack relevant skills, I may but the party always has all relevant skills.  As such, we always have the apposite skill to hand.<br/><br/>I think that's a shame, I think there's a lot of fun in realising that you have an obstacle and lack the appropriate skills, so need to get creative.  That's an area players can really bring their creativity to a scene, but here it's less an issue of the players getting creative than seeing which of them has a relevant skill.  I also think it's very gamey, when I tried to create some pregens for it to run a trial game with my group (we often have a first run with pregens to get a feel for the game then create characters afterwards if people take to it) I struggled with making them credible as the game required them to have all the game's skills between them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65242/#Comment_65242" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T07:25:33+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  7:25AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Max, you're incorrect. I'll read again tonight, but the section on preparing the adventures speaks specifically to having a chain of scenes, and having the clues link them to each other. When reading the sample adventure it seemed to me that it was a perfect example of precisely what the text said to do in terms of preparing an adventure. Yes, the text does say that the players should be allowed to use any ability to find the clues in question. There's some leeway there as to how the scene goes. But it's very clear about linking from scene to scene, and scene types, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn't expecting to find that in the game, note. I was suprised to find that this was what was chosen. I could have read it incorrectly I suppose - as I say, I'll go reread my copy (that travelled with me to Forge Con last weekend). But I don't think I'm wrong about this. I think Don, too, is seeing what I'm seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I'm having trouble figuring out precisely what you're advocating. In the one case you say that you play does not pre-determine what the players will do at all. Well, that's what I'm advocating. Yet you then say that my solution sounds like a "moving clue" solution. I think I'm advocating playing precisely like you do. Which is not what Gumshoe advocates by your own admission, fixing a problem that you think has a better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I think that the tension can still be there without any chance of not getting to the endgame (just as I believe there can be fear of character death without rules that require it at random). But that's a slightly different issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nLargely I think we agree. I'd have to check to be sure, too, but I think that the players aren't required to take every ability, just strongly recommended to do so (there are sections about what to do if a player doesn't show, which means that they accept that not every skill will be present in every session). But I agree with you on what it means. It means that any published railroady adventure, or any adventure the GM makes, doesn't have to worry about the actual abilities of the characters... they will have what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yeah, allowing players to be "Creative" in solving the problem is exactly what I'm advocating, and saying that Essoterrorists does not allow. To a greater extent than you're saying it blocks them. But we agree that it does it on some level.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65257/#Comment_65257" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T08:06:39+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  8:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, <br><br>If I'm incorrect (which is of course possible) about the predetermined path issue then yes, we are in agreement, advocating the same thing in different words.<br><br>I also agree you can maintain the tension without the possibility of failure, and fear of character death without random death, but as you say that's another discussion.<br><br>Assuming that I have misremembered how it works, that makes it a  game which provides for a better means for moving players through predetermined hoops.

As noted above Esoterrorist takes a step forward in giving a "better means for moving players through predetermined hoops."  It IS a better way to handle it in that games like CoC don't address it at all. The Basic Roleplay system is about task resolution and going crazy and says little to nothing about scenes and the ongoing plot.  Esoterrorists/GUMSHOE gives players many paths to move the story along by fixing a common problem in other task resolution systems - the game stops because the players don't learn what they need to to move forward.  Is GUMSHOE the end-all-and-be-all to mystery games?  No, but I found it a refreshing step and something I'd be willing to run, especially with those extra design notes mentioned earlier.<br><br>2.  That being said, it still seems to further one goal - "making better GMs (among GM-centric games)."  The focus is really on "how do you run a game and give the players the illusion that they have free will."  His design notes even mention that often the best way to do this is to show the players openly that you're making decisions on the fly (all the while you really have a plan).  This was the main thesis/query of my original post (hopefully laid out better here).  I see this a lot.  While many of us are thinking about "how do I empower us all to work together to tell a good story equally" I see the big dogs handing out (read: selling) GMing advice I had been using for literally decades.  The shame of it is that the core constituent either finds validation in such products, showing them that they "have it right" or the material comes off as being fresh and new to people tired of comparing their cocks at the game table.  In my indie-game myopia it seems to me that the companies ARE trying to adapt and progress but simply widen the differences between the mainstream hobby and the independant games (as was discussed in the Delancy thread a short while back).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65498/#Comment_65498" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T11:07:09+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 11:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still with you on this, yep.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Still haven't re-read the pertinent sections... re-reading Martian Chronicles at the moment, and forgot).<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65500/#Comment_65500" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T11:13:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 11:13AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pardon me for asking this, but does anyone ever play a mystery style game for anything other than a challenge?

I often run mysteries, telling the players the solution from the start, in order that we discover things about the players through the course of the investigation.

Solving mysteries are like other challenges.  It's possible to have a game with a bunch of combat that isn't focused on the players trying to win the combats.  So mysteries can in principle support things like personal horror as the PCs descend into madness on the basis of what they find as they solve the mystery.  However, I agree that typically mysteries are focused on the challenge of solving them.  <br><br>The thing about the GUMSHOE ad line is that it's not actually an innovation to have a clue that you don't have to roll dice to find.  There are lots of mystery scenarios written over decades which have these.  There is a basic set of information that is automatically available and which is sufficient to move ahead -- but there are extra details that the players can roll to find.  <br><br>I often enjoy mysteries, but I did not like GUMSHOE's style of jumping through hoops.  I think good mystery scenarios can be done without a predetermined path or tree of scenes.  Instead, the GM knows the backstory and evidence, and the players try to solve it by coming up with their own plan for investigation -- which allows a lot of room for flexibility.

I think the gamism comes in where the players compare what they accomplished truly on their own, versus what ended up being GM-Gimmes.

Assuming the goal is to see at least a portion of the party get to the final encounter, killing everyone off seems absurd. Instead, blown rolls of any kind are more likely interpretted as a failure to succeed well rather than total failure.

That is, the idea is that you're trying to find the bad-guys, and destroy them, and your abilities as a player are being tested in the process. It's a Lovecraftian Dungeon Crawl, because that's all anybody knew back then. Note that COC is a massive failure at this, as well, because your odds of succeeding are nil. Worse, there's usually no player tactics allowed in the vast majority of the situations. If the GM calls for a climbing roll, and you fail, fall, and die, that's hardly something that the player could have prevented through good tactical play (which leads to the rope-climbing problem, which I can address elsewhere).</blockquote>\nUm, I've successfully run CoC by the book for many years, as have many others.  My actual play does not remotely recognise this description, which is sort of a parody of how the game actually plays.<br/><br/>Hell, even at 14 when I first encountered it we ran it by the book and didn't encounter these problems.  This strikes me as a classic theory critique, based on perceptions of play without asking those who play and enjoy the game if they actually encounter these issues.<br/><br/>Komeradbob makes some good points, but the bit quoted above just bears so little relation to the actual game that I don't even recognise it.

It only renders your choices irrelevant if "choosing where to look for the clue" is the choice we're interested in. More concretely, suppose some wealthy guy has two homes - a city flat and a country mansion. A book or letter that it would handy for the players to find could plausibly be in either one. If it's convenient for it to simply turn up in the first one that the players go to, what's lost? They may still be very different places. The costs and consequences of going to one rather than the other may be strikingly different. And the choice to visit the second place still remains. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm with you on most of the rest of this. There's no need for CoC to resemble a Lovecraftian dungeon crawl, valid choice though it may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike, you seem to me to be saying that because BRP has no specific allowance for player tactics, that most CoC games won't include them. I don't think that's a fair equation, either logically or in my experience. A CoC GM who kills PCs by calling for a roll where either you succeed and the game continues, or else you fail and die, isn't my idea of a good CoC GM. When I run CoC, success and failure both need to be interesting, if at all possible. If only one is interesting, why are we rolling? I appreciate not everyone runs it that way, but I doubt I'm alone, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nkomradebob, when CoC is run as "there's one thing you have to do to solve the scenario correctly, the GM knows what it is, and you have to guess it", I agree there's an element of gamism about that. But it doesn't have to be that way. How about: there's a complicated back-story, known only the GM, with some interesting characters. The GM understands what the problem is, but doesn't have a particular solution in mind. Instead, the players and GM will play together to achieve some kind of resolution, which could include many kinds of success or failure, including dazzling success, TPK, pyrhhic victory, etc. Does that still sound gamist to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65648/#Comment_65648" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T05:52:02+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  5:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I get the impression that the "Yeah, but with a good GM..." argument only serves to reinforce what Mike is saying.<br/><br/>FWIW, my experience with CoC back in college wasn't Gamist.

CoC is an old school game, is my point. We can't judge it entirely by the provided mechanics. In trad games of this type, it's up to the GM when to call for a roll. Should we judge the game by what it can do used with a modicum of sense, or badly it's possible to mess it up by running it like it was D&amp;D;? (I don't mean that perjoratively, but in the sense of expecting Gamist play)<br/>\n<br/>\nMax, I would only do the shifting clue as a form of illusionism, but one that I think is harmless. I think of it as not knowing myself exactly where the clue is, until play says to me: this would be a cool place for it to turn up. Which might not be any of the places I had anticipated, and might even have major consequences for my back story. That's fine, so long as I can accommodate them.

Many. When I say "games" here, I mean entire "campaigns" - however those tend to be really short IME, since the entire party often dies in the first scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOT A PARODY. ACTUAL PLAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun by the rules, I can show you scenarii that make this quite likely. You have to bend the rules significantly in these scenarios to allow for players to get anywhere near the end of the scenario. I'm talking about published stuff like Masks of Nyarlathotep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also played many games of COC where, yeah, the GM did use GM force and illusionism to ensure that you got further into the scenario. That's probably just as common. But I consider it a fix of an otherwise broken paradigm (unless you like gamism where the challenge is to see what percentage of the adventure you can complete).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've run COC... and come to the entirely same conclusion... I can run the game by the rules, or I can fudge, and have the adventure come to completion. This was all way before the Forge even existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen examples of COC play across a plethora of gaming cultures (for instance three entire sizable clubs all dedicated to playing nothing but COC). In all cases there's this ethic where the GMs who are playing by the rules are considered "Killer GMs" and the "Good GMs" are the ones who somehow manage to make the game work. This is classic "System Doesn't Matter" talk that comes from the fact that the system is terribly flawed. That's not to say that this must have been your experience. But even if your experience with the game is somehow "typical" I don't see how, given lots of other data, that means that it isn't flawed for at least a substantial percentage of folks who attempt to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for links to the essays, sorry, but the Forge is currently glitchy... else I would have posted them the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the previous subject - I re-read the salient portions of Essoterrorists. And I agree with you, Max, that there's nothing that absolutely mandates a railroad. As you (or somebody mentions), Robin does talk about how to give players some freedom. But concludes that the illusion of freedom (he uses the word "appearance") is more important than actual freedom. Moreover, the one thing that is mandated for scenario design is the "Chain of clues." These are to be thought up before play, and followed scene to scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat appears to be the case is that he's allowing for various play styles, in theory, by not specifying how those scenes are established. In this way, you're right... the sample scenario is just an indication of one possible way to play. The problem is that, given the chain of clues, I'm not really seeing a lot of flexibility. That is, I could use the style that I mention above, with getting clues to players no matter where they go. Except that, with a chain of clues, I think that's going to be difficult to not have that lead to some specific scene. I mean, if the clue is a name of a limo service... you're going to go investigate the limo service, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nActual play would be required to see whether or not it would work. I suspect this is Robin putting his usual egalitarianism into the game: he wants it to be capable of supporting all styles of play. As such, I'm sure it's "bendable" into the form of play for which I'd use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, like you, I'd rather allow for the characters to fail (noting that, in my case success or failure is irrellevant, and the play will be about the character developement).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my general objection still stands. Essoterrorists (Gumshoe, more generically), solves for one particular problem that doesn't happen to plague me, nor has to plague anybody else. There will be some this will benefit. Those playing COC and having trouble with the rules as written may well find this a solution to many of their problems, and have fun with it. It's not fatally flawed. I just think that there are better solutions. So I'm not seeing it as a step forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just in the name of disclosure of my biases, I don't resent Robin for the recent reassignment of Quest Worlds to him from myself and others. I resent the people who made the assignment. I think Robin is an excellent designer. This is just not one of his best efforts, IMO.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65699/#Comment_65699" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T08:15:46+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  8:15AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, lots of points there so I'll come back as I think them through, but just to clarify one point.  When I talk about running CoC as written, I mean in accordance with the text of the core book, I do not mean running published scenarios or in line with the internet culture that has grown up around it.  Both those latter things are FUBARed IMO.<br><br>Now, I do accept that lots of folk playing by the rules got subpar results, it doesn't work for everyone, but I also have a fair whack of experience with people playing by the rules as written who did get the results I speak of.  I think the problem lies more in modes of play established by published scenarios than the text in the actual game itself leading to the text in the core book being glossed by later material, but I'll talk more about that when I have more time.  In particular, I want to get a copy in front of me so I can explain better why I don't think the original rules support the default play that later evolved and that doesn't IMO work well but actually support something much more successful.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65713/#Comment_65713" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T09:05:16+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  9:05AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the COC debate is heading towards it's own thread - let's not derail this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, much of the play that I'm talking about predates the Internet (well general public access to it, at least). Played in in the 80s a lot. As for playing it without the scenarii... yeah, that would sure help. But scenarii are what most people at the time used to understand how to play these games. As kids, I'm pretty sure we couldn't have run a game without a published scenario. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of the COC thing is that there is a mystery gamism style that's common (whether or not COC can do this well or not). A goal of play is to see if you can solve the mystery. More common is drift to "apparent gamism" where the GM is actually assuring progress to some extent. Both of these sorts of play often have issues. Gumshoe fixes some of the problems with the latter sort. But it's certainly no fix for the gamism - it explicitly eliminates the gamism portion of solving the mystery. You're going to get to the end. The only question is whether or not the combats go in your favor (not much gamism support there, either, in this system).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think, generally, that the game is supposed to support gamism well. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65719/#Comment_65719" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T09:50:02+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  9:50AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting back to the original post comments (sorry aout the CoC excursion)\n<blockquote>My impression is that many companies are going in the direction of "give GMs tools to run games and lead their players through THEIR plots."

It may help railroady GMs railroad that much better, IMO.  However, I think one thing that people don't always think about in these debates, is that often folks who play these games are playing, y'know, other games too, with other styles. Sometimes railroady play (even a straight railroad game where the PCs are there to act out things along the way) is awesome and refreshing.<br><br>The thing that I love about Esoterrorists is this:  I ran two scenarios from the Delta Green/DG Countdown books a few years back (the "x-files"ish one with the alien parasite, and the longer campaign that begins with the crystal cult and the dude who has an explosion in his house and people are half-teleported through the houses' walls, chairs, etc).  IIRC, one was using BRP, the other using Fudge.  In both games, I used about 1/3 or so of the written adventure. The rest of that material was awesome stuff: But it was all for the GMs eyes only, unless the PCs specifically roll high enough or had those skills to find out that info (like the reasons and motives behind everyone, the secret info for why the aliens are doing what they're doing, or the ties between the bank ledger and the cult, etc).  Running pre-gen CoC scenarios tends to be a grand affair, since they tend to be written extremely well, have cool plot elements, awesome NPCs, are usually really well thought out, lots of hand-out material, etc.  But I realize that from The Corbett House (THE first CoC adventure everyone plays) all the way to the Hastaur Adventures in DG: Countdown, they all fall prey to this "Only the GM gets to know all the really awesome stuff most of the time, unless the dice are on fire and the players are having their characters 'click everywhere' " syndrome.<br><br>With Esoterrorists, I can run through any of those awesome Delta Green adventures, and actually in the course of the adventure have a chance to present all this cool information to the players.  <br><br>That alone made the purchase worthwhile. Note, though, I only planned to run through the Nazi Zombies DG adventure in the next few months (plus an "Esoterrorists of Waterdeep" game set in forgotten realms), I haven't actually had a play experience with it yet.

Sure, in Esoterrorists, you can guarantee that the players will get 100% of the information by making all of the clues automatic.  However, you can do exactly the same thing in a traditional system.  Just don't bother rolling and always give the player the clue.  As I've explained before, automatic information that you don't have to roll dice for has been built into virtually every system.  <br><br>On the other hand, if you put a lot of optional clues in which players have to spend points for, then they'll miss some of the clues.  i.e. If you have 10 clues but players only have 5 points to spend on them, then that's equivalent to rolling against a 50% skill.  The basic case is that the players will only get half the clues.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65814/#Comment_65814" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T13:39:22+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  1:39PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the scenario say, "Players should roll their Library Use to find out about the demise of Poor Mr. Richards" seems pretty clear instructions to have the players roll. Nowhere in CoC does it say, "Just give the players what they need to know if they're searching for the info in a library" or anything more general like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it's certainly possible to do this. But it's a breach in the social contract that's made by agreeing to play the rules of COC. That doesn't make it a bad idea. But it doesn't mean that COC is enabling this sort of information transfer in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncoding it as a rule is new, if not remarkably so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65816/#Comment_65816" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T13:48:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  1:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the main thing about Library Use was that it takes time?

Yes, you <b><i>can</i></b> have a scenario which clearly calls for a skill roll to get a given piece of information.  However, this does <b><i>not</i></b> mean that it is in violation of the basic Call of Cthulhu rules for there to be information available without a skill roll.  <br/><br/>Automatic information is built into virtually all scenarios.  In fact, I am mystified as to how you can argue otherwise.  Can you cite me the Call of Cthulhu rule which says that a skill roll is always required for the players to learn anything?  For example, suppose I have a scenario which has the following bit: \n<blockquote><i>Inside the study the players find a pool of blood on the floor below the chair by the desk, but no other blood anywhere on the room.  On the desk there is a large volume open to a marked page.  (Give the players handout <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> at this point.)  With a successful Spot Hidden roll, the players will notice that there is a book missing from the small, dusty shelf on the desk -- removed recently.</i></blockquote>\nOK, so here we have some automatic information -- given in player handout <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  Is this a violation of the social contract or written rules?

I think it IS good GMing just not great playing (as a GM and a player).  I did this all the time - I was seen as extemporainious boy.  I had a general plot.  I knew who the bd guys were.  I knew what some of the gotcha's were going to be and I wrote out an adventure in a means that I knew my players would buy in.  There was almost no conflict between what I wanted to run and what they wanted to play.  However, there was plenty of "20 minutes of fun in four hours."  Okay so maybe my games were closer to "two hours of fun in four hours" but as I went I became more and more disastisfied with the process.<br/><br/>No that I've drank the SG Kool-Aid it's hard to go back but after reading Esoterrorists I realized that I'm still a good traditional GM and I don't quite mind being the monkey to my scenario's organ-grinder for my players enjoyment on occasion.  This is an interesting method to do this.  Esoterrorists system is simple and fairly player driven (in the spend points of a skill to add to a roll or just take your chances).  I am confident in my ability to write a sceanrio that makes this engaging for my players and in the meantime I can insert some SG goodness dragging the late bloomers further away from traditional gaming <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I guess I am surprised to some degree until I actually look at the phenomena.  And I wondered if my assertions of the situation were off base:  I would think that story-games design would be a natural direction for companies that taught narrative games.  I would not have been surprised to see more stakes driven play (like Falkenstein) and player created situations (a natural transition from Vampire preludes to kickers).  These are not obscure ideas anymore.  Many games get a lot of airtime - BW, SotC, and Dogs - while others have been around for quite a while and are at least in many game designer's radar - HeroQuest and Sorcerer.  So I can only think that maybe there is a perceived sense that <b><i>GM directed play will sell more books.</i></b> <br/><br/>Do we think that may be the reason for the mainstream narrativists designers to shy away from SG techniques?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65910/#Comment_65910" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T11:34:56+00:00" title="April 28, 2007 11:34AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm late to the thread, but holy shit you guys have tied yourself in knots over some really simple stuff. Balbinus did yeoman's work in this thread, kudos to him. I'm here to straighten everything out. Just relax, it won't hurt a bit.<br/><br/>Starting at the bottom and working our way to the top:<br/><br/>There's no question that "there's tons of cool stuff here but only the person who bought the book knows it" is popular and common, but it's not limited to mysteries and railroaded games. <i>This is the worldbuilding question again.</i>  Yes, god dammit, it's the same god damn question! If the players never find out that King Ralph is secretly a demon lich monstar, it's the same thing as not rolling high enough on their Find Player Handout roll and not getting the cool blueprint handout of the secret base.  And my reason for liking all that stuff is the same reason that I like the worldbuilding: because it adds to the tone I sometimes like to use, the tone of nonfiction. If players don't see it all, or only see it in glimpses, that's okay with me. They're not meant to see it all. But if it's not prepared, and I'm sitting down with a nonfiction-style mystery game, it's like sitting down to play a $10,000 poker game with only $100 in your pocket. You can't  ante up.<br/><br/>How the hell did we get to the second page of a thread about mysteries without anyone talking about either mystery stories or real-world investigations?<br/><br/>Seriously, sit your ass down in the <a href="http://foia.fbi.gov/room.htm" rel="nofollow">FBI FOIA reading room</a> and read some actual case files. Even the simplest case has so much detail that you'll see a completely non-story-related, non-fun-related reason why the one-roll-stopgap is problematic: because it destroys verisimilitude. There is always another witness, another document, another avenue, always, always, always. <br/><br/>This topic (mysteries and investigations) and everything I have to say about it is way too big for this thread, so I'll start a new one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65934/#Comment_65934" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T19:44:35+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  7:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>How the hell did we get to the second page of a thread about mysteries without anyone talking about either mystery stories or real-world investigations?</blockquote>\nI don't think we did. Mystery story - it's generally considered that a mystery story in which relevant facts are <i>never</i> revealed to the reader is a poor one. <i>Detective</i> stories do that all the time, because the actual crime isn't the point, but a mystery in which the reader does not have all the puzzle pieces so that they at least <i>feel as though</i> they have a fair shake at figuring it out feels like a cheat on the part of the author. Real-world investigations - (almost) nobody has the time or patience to actually play out a real investigation. Real investigations are like accounting audits or debugging code: painful. It's not a bit like it is on <i>CSI</i> except in very rare cases.<br/><br/>What GUMSHOE and other illusion-y approaches to mystery stories are trying to deliver, generally, are <i>CSI</i>. Where there's a neat sequence of clues that lead inexorably one-to-the-next, with maybe an appropriately dramatic blind alley that delays the denoument until after the last commercial break.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65943/#Comment_65943" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T21:10:11+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  9:10PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course that's what they are trying to deliver (and I was trying to steer the discussion a little away from mystery games specifically and more toward mainstream design trends).  And I mentioned that I agree there is some fun to be had in these sorts of games on occasion (for me and I suspect others here).<br/><br/>But I have also seen mystery games that fail and stall and the players are just not on the same page as the GM.  I mean are folks here saying that the punchline is more important than the process in that trail of clues?  Wouldn't it be more satisfying to have the group developing clues-gathering scenes working their way toward a common end?  Heck, players could even come up with their own clues to "spring" on the group, steering the story in unsuspecting directions.  I often have scenes of the main villain having discussions with minions only to lure the protagonists in with a silver tongue or a lofty intention - offering the group the tension and suspense of character's having to make difficult decisions laster when they find the truth.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any confusion as to the type and intention of the games we speak of.  Rather, I think some question the fun factor of wading through clues which the players have little real input and the GM must struggle against what really interests the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65968/#Comment_65968" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T05:18:05+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  5:18AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The adventure supplied with Esoterrorists gives one way you can structure a GUMSHOE adventure. However, you can structure adventures in anyway you can with any game where you make rolls to find clues. In Fear Itself we offer other ways to use the GUMSHOE system in a much less structured way appropriate for other genres, for example the floating core clue and loose adventure spine.<br/><br/>GUMSHOE does not stop you doing anything you already do in actual play in the other similar games. Specifically, if PCs find (or think of)  a another way of progressing, that's absolutely fine. We've found that it makes play run much more smoothly than with certain other games - the mechanic doesn't impinge on the roleplaying experience. Basically, it's what the PCs do with the clues that is important, not the clues themselves. Steve Dempsey set up a game where one way to get ahead quickly was to torture a suspect, but the PCs didn't do this, and had to discover a more convoluted way to get ahead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66157/#Comment_66157" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T09:58:01+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  9:58AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Straw man, John.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I'm saying is that the way that I and many other people played COC, which was dysfunctional, can be seen to be indicated from the rules.

That is, we thought we were doing it correctly from our reading. Which was heavily influenced by playing D&amp;D, and using the COC modules and adventures (including the one from the book).<br/><br/>Nobody is saying that "automatic information" isn't available in all RPGs.</blockquote>\nSorry -- it wasn't an intentional straw man.  If you're agreeing that it's not a social contract violation to have automatic information, then we're in agreement.  <br/><br/>Your statement here is quite generic.  If you just say that "We had some problems with CoC that were indicated from the rules" -- then I of course must agree with you.  I had a laundry list of complaints with the rules myself.  For example, I would completely agree with saying that Call of Cthulhu in general (and especially the original design) does not provide good direction on how to create good scenarios, and many of the examples it gives are bad.  <br/><br/>This should probably be continued on a Call of Cthulhu thread, but the real question is what problems were indicated from the rules.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pelgrane</cite>The adventure supplied with Esoterrorists gives one way you can structure a GUMSHOE adventure. However, you can structure adventures in anyway you can with any game where you make rolls to find clues. In Fear Itself we offer other ways to use the GUMSHOE system in a much less structured way appropriate for other genres, for example the floating core clue and loose adventure spine.<br/><br/>GUMSHOE does not stop you doing anything you already do in actual play in the other similar games. Specifically, if PCs find (or think of)  a another way of progressing, that's absolutely fine. We've found that it makes play run much more smoothly than with certain other games - the mechanic doesn't impinge on the roleplaying experience. Basically, it's what the PCs do with the clues that is important, not the clues themselves. Steve Dempsey set up a game where one way to get ahead quickly was to torture a suspect, but the PCs didn't do this, and had to discover a more convoluted way to get ahead.</blockquote>\nI'd mostly agree with this -- though I think there can be arguments made either way as far as the mechanic not impinging on the role-playing experience.  I think some people will find it less impinging to spend points from the investigative skill pools.  Other people will find it less impinging to just roll dice rather than make a meta-game choice.  <br/><br/>I don't have a good sense offhand of who prefers one versus the other, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66267/#Comment_66267" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T01:13:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  1:13AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Heya,<br/>I think it may be helpful to note that Robin said on his blog once that he has never read or played InSpectres.

So?"<br/></blockquote>\nOne of the first things we discussed when deciding how this game should go is whether the PCs would be co-authors in inventing a non-existent mystery (the twenty questions approach) or whether we should use a pre-defined mystery. We are both well aware of the techniques used in InSpectres; they go back a long way. I remember talking with James Wallis about his game Youdunnit where a similar mechanic is used. GUMSHOE uses a traditional power structure, with the GM creating a mystery with a pre-determined cause. This makes it a different game to InSpectres, but it succeeds in what it is trying to do.<br/><br/>It is not the indie game you are looking for. The interesting thing is that GUMSHOE is extremely easy to adapt to the other model; in fact, on of the earliest proposals we came up with was a player-powered mystery generator. You would spend your points not to uncover clues, but to invent them. That version is still on the cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66272/#Comment_66272" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T02:34:07+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  2:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2007 2:34AM by Troy_Costisick.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pelgrane</cite><br/>The interesting thing is that GUMSHOE is extremely easy to adapt to the other model; in fact, on of the earliest proposals we came up with was a player-powered mystery generator.
