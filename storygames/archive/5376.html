Somehow it didn't occur to me that there'd be a rockin' amout of indie game shit going down and that I'd be seriously in the mood for that scene come the end of January.</p>\n<p>So, to those of you that have been to Dreamation before, what am I missing?  Should I make plans for going next year?  Is it really that awesome?  Tell me all about it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120738/#Comment_120738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T11:06:29+00:00" title="January 20, 2008 11:06AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dreamation is, bar none, the best place to play indie games (that I've experienced).  It's positioned at a good time in the year for a ton of east coast small-press designers to make it, so there's a lot of direct access between fans and designers going on.  The IPR booth is usually positioned right outside the play area, so it ends up being a focusing, social hub for a lot of that interest-segment.  The convention staff are WILDLY supportive of the indie games scene.<br/><br/>DexCon, its twin-cousin, comes later in the year, sandwiched right between Origins and GenCon.  This makes it less ideal for a lot of people, so the designer-attendance tends to be lower, but it's still a good second option to pursue.<br/><br/>There are four conventions I won't miss in a year if I can help it: Dreamation, Origins, DexCon, and GenCon.  So take that for what you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120739/#Comment_120739" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T11:11:23+00:00" title="January 20, 2008 11:11AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a combination of who goes (most of the game designers between Boston and North Carolina), and the extreme accommodation that Vinny et al. make for the IGE crew.

But since the investment is <em>so</em> much smaller than GC, the selling doesn't need to take such center stage.</p>\n<p>What <em>does</em> take center stage is the frenzy of play. The Indie Games Explosion run by Kat Miller in the past and Emily Care Boss and Robert Bohl this year is an ever-increasing thing. Vinny et al. have made us extremely welcome, offering food and lodging and scheduling us as pretty much the central event of the con. Last year we were seriously overbooked and judging from my own registration numbers this year, that might happen again despite our best efforts. IGE was second only to a D&amp;D event last year, if I recall (though that was a bit of a weird thing of Vinny to say \u2014 we've got dozens of games and D&amp;D is only one...). We wound up taking extra rooms outside of the normal RPG spaces to fit everyone.</p>\n<p>And really, it's the "everyone" that's the best part. I've never been around such an enthusiastic, friendly, and odd cast of characters anywhere else in RPGdom. That's where I met Judd, Rob Bohl, Clinton, Mike and Kat Miller, Tony LB, Keith Senflowski, Jenn Rodgers, Luke Crane, and a bunch of other people central to my publishing universe <em>all the first year I was there</em>. I don't know who else is going to be central to my publishing universe by next year, but I think there's a good chance they'll be at Dreamation.</p>\n<p>I also had one of the best games I've ever played there, a late-beta of The Mountain Witch that hooked me up with Tim Kleinert and eventually had us producing two books together. How could I have forgotten that? I'm probably forgetting lots of other interesting people and thrilling events. It's just a big deal in a little place, you know?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
