But you could have other components come out as regular intervals (weekly columns, every other week a Youtube tutorial on an existing game and on Thursdays some recorded actual play sessions and such).  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, have access to a backlog of finished games and hacks and things be part of the subscription.New stuff is added to this backlog, at irregular intervals, as it is finished.  When I subscribed to Pyramid online and to D&amp;D Insider, the new stuff each week was nice but the access to a backlog of old stuff was much nicer. <br/> <br/>So basically, a few regular features that can be reliably produced on a schedule, plus several sporadic projects that are published as they are finished.  (Make sure that a few of the bigger projects are available right from day one, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381047/#Comment_381047" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T13:34:58+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  1:34PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not well established because the service isn't known by many.

Plus kickstarting it each time helps build your community.<br/><br/>The "how to tutorials" could be done simply by recording a Google Hangouts game demo.

In addition the service would also assist facilitate the purchase of physical product from producers.<br/><br/>The service provider would make the bulk of the subscription (netflix pays out 20-25% in royalties) but then only pick up say 10% on the physical and full digital purchases.
