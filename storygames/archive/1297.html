                    So I'm splitting off this topic from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1285&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>Discussing Once You Go Indie ... </b></a>   because it seems like a sidestep.  So it seems like there's a certain amount of agreement that mainstream <i>publishers</i> are largely neutral or positive about indie work.  However, there's some questions about freelance writers.  Joshua said that it's a split, so I'm taking it to it's own thread.  <br/><br/>So, here are statements about this from that thread :
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Judging by mainstream publishers' reactions to indie publishing -- from the harsh disdain to the attempts to subsume indie games -- I think they may be seeing the same thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I don't talk to many pure publishers, but most of the major industry folk whom I talk to are extremely positive about indie games.  I'm thinking here of Mike Mearls, Ken Hite, Jonathan Tweet, and Robin Laws, for example.  So, there are a few like Malcolm Sheppard who are disdainful of indie games, but it's not like he's a major industry figure or anything, just a minor White Wolf freelance writer.</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite> I'm seeing, over and over again, mainstream publishers (their hardcore fans are sometimes a different story) being really excited about indie games.  Kenneth Hite, Robin Laws, Steve Kenson, and a TON of other notables have said nice things about specific games or the indie gaming community in general.  White Wolf hired Jared Sorenson to write and publish what is basically an indie game INSIDE THE NEW VAMPIRE GAME MASTER'S GUIDE.  This fact still blows my mind. It didn't make a big splash in the indie community because none of us were willing to buy the book to get Jared's 20 pages.  We're also partially responsible for inspiring more than a handful of former mainstream freelancers to publish their own indie games (and not just d20 stuff too).  I'm totally not seeing the hate from mainstream publishers and game designers.  Some hardcore mainstream RPG fans, yes, but usually not people actually involved in making and publishing games.</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Edwards</cite>Joshua's observation about non-independent publisher reaction makes more sense to me with a little charitable reading-in on my part - if he's talking about<em>freelancers</em>, then yeah: the general reaction seems to be horror and fear, along with a lot of bizarre non-logical or non-factual claims, at least among a vocal subset (Malcolm Sheppard as mentioned, Bruce Baugh, et cetera). Mearls is a clear exception. I also agree with the objections to the non-charitable reading of hte statement listed already, and I'd like to add the names Ryan Dancey and Peter Adkison to those who've consistently and enthusiastically supported the Forge effort, at least.</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>  And now to the tricky part. Those "hostile" freelancers like Bruce and Malcom. I'm friends with Malcom IRL, and he and Mo went to school together. I know him a lot better, I feel, than those who only encounter him on line. I don't know Bruce that way, but I've talked with him online for years and have some sense of the man. And my general impression of both of them is not that they're against independent press games (both, in fact, have done work on such things) or that they're against expirementation and progress in RPG design. I think both of them are very much for those things. I just think they don't like the way we do it, and possibly more to the point, I think that at this point they just don't like us. We have a community that has a lot of joiner and clubby elements, and those who don't espouse the party line often have a rough go of it. So, as in any academy/archeology of knowledge situation, it is inevitable that we'll get fractures along personality and idealogical lines. It isn't as simple as "Malcom and Bruce are scared of change" because that's bullshit.</blockquote>
So, first of all, I'm not sure that there is really a trend here of freelance writers, given the two cited examples of Bruce Baugh and Malcolm Sheppard.  On the other hand, Ken Hite is also a freelance writer, for example -- just a higher-profile one.  As far as I know, Robin Laws is as well.  <br/><br/>So I'm inclined to think that this is more of variation rather than a trend.  I roomed with John Snead at GenCon Indy this year, who is also a professional freelance writer.  He's not pro-indie, and has had mixed statements -- but for the most part I think his clash has nothing to do with the indie publishing but rather about the point of immersion.  <br/><br/>So, some theorizing here:  I suspect that fans and less established freelance writers are more likely to take personally insults which are thrown at mainstream games which they are involved in.  Whereas publishers and well-established freelance writers are more able to ignore them, perhaps having developed harder skins or simply more solid positions to put insults beneath them.  But that's an open point which I'm still pondering.  Thoughts?                </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>I also think a lot of it has to do with where the things the given individual likes and deals with fit with the dominant voices of the Forge and other communities. Anyone, like John Snead, who is an immersionist who deals with the concepts of it seriously in his gaming and writing, is probably going to have some issues with the way immersion gets smacked about when we talk about it. Lord knows its a sticky wicket, and if it is something you are passionate about and get responses from folks with whom you are trying to talk seriously that run the range from "you are just wrong" to "what you are talking about doesn't even exist"... well, one can probably see where some clashes of personality and ideology might start to arise. <br/><br/>I mean seriously, as someone who is often in the middle, I've heard members of our extended community say things just as negative as those things said by (most) freelancers in the other direction ::cough::braindamage:cough::. It really isn't a matter of "why can't/won't they talk to us" so much as "why can't/won't we talk to each other."                        </div>

                            John, as the guy responsible for starting that sidestep, I think it's totally a red herring.<br/><br/>First of all, the distinction between Freelancers and Publishers is really fuzzy.  Sure, in any given instance of writing/designing/publishing, you're either one or the other, but when we're talking about <em>people</em>, it gets weird.  Is Ken Hite "just a freelancer"?  Was John Wick a freelancer or a publisher before he struck out into indie territory?  Loads and loads of folks who we'd recognize as "the big guys" now started off as freelancers.  Some folks -- like Brand who forgot to mention it -- are both freelancers for others and self-publishers at the same time.<br/><br/>Then the distinction between Mainstream and Indie <em>when talking about people</em> is also fuzzy.  Again I point at Brand.  Look at any of the "mainstream publishers" who started off as just them and maybe a couple friends -- definitely indie -- and are now recognized as part of the "industry."  Or look at it the other way around: <em>Shock:</em> is Joshua's book but it's got some Ben Lehman fiction in it.  Matt Snyder has done layout for how many "indie" titles, most recently <em>Mutual Decision</em>?  Were Ben and Matt freelancers?  Were Joshua and Ron "mainstream"?  With the notable exceptions of Wizards and White Wolf, most "mainstream" game companies do not have a central office, do not have more than a handful of fulltimers (and the fulltimers are usually the founders/owners), and look a whole lot like indie publishers.<br/><br/>Lastly, we're not really talking about a lot of people.  "Freelancers for Mainstream Games" is, assuming we mean folks who feed themselves and their families off of their earnings, is... probably less than 100 people total?  I'll be generous and say it's 250.  And that number includes Ken Hite and Robin D Laws.  It includes people who are also self-publishing as well.  With such a small population that overlaps with other populations so much, it's hard to extract any clean data or make any meaningful conclusion about the body as a whole.<br/><br/>I'd really rather consider everybody involved in publishing RPGs to be in the same boat.  The products that we make are different, sure, and can be categorized and scrutinized, but the people... I find it easier to deal with them as people, one at a time.                        </div>

                            My two cents.<br/><br/>I am a former freelance for White Wolf.  I still would be had I not decided that spending time with my children was more important than writing to deadline.<br/><br/>I'm very much in favor of indie games.<br/><br/>HOWEVER.  As Brand was quoted above, this community and the Forge community (I realize they overlap) can be hard on those who are not fully in the 'in-crowd'.  I have experienced a bit of that myself.  It's largely why I am more or less active here and more or less not active over at Forge.  <br/><br/>It's the curse of humans in groups.  We tend to cluster and exclude, without meaning to do so.                        </div>

                            John Snead's issues are nothing to do with indie versus Forge and everything to do with him preferring immersion which he sees as a distinct CA and him running into some occasionally very poorly worded resistance to that as an argument.  It's a red herring here.<br/><br/>Bruce Baugh I have no idea, Malcolm is scathing about many things, it's part of his charm.<br/><br/>Not sure it's a trend, just individuals who for quite different reasons have an issue.  I don't think there's any overall analysis to be made, just some people not getting on with some other people and sometimes that's linked to these games and sometimes it's not.                        </div>

From a partly-outsider perspective it's something like: "Okay, these guys have a clear focus and are excited about it. It's good stuff, but it's not my focus. They overlap, though. I'd like to exchange notes, learn something and return the favour, but I can't snap them out of their focus. I feel dumb."                        </div>

                            John: including Law/Stafford/etc. when I think the term "indie" is just part of my personal fight (with myself mostly) against silly exclusionary elitism.  Yes, the Forge is fundamentally a site about publishing, but it's become a lot more than that, something that has a lot of implications about design and game culture too.  And, in my mind, we share a lot of similarities with other folks in the design and culture areas, if not in the publishing realm.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think, as much as we fight for it, we can really restrict the term "indie" to mean creator-ownership (and why should we?  we have the term "creator-ownership").  There's already WAY too much drift going on.                        </div>

                            I hope this doesn't sound out of line...<br/><br/>The only trend I've really noticed is a big crossover between people who diss the Forge and people who happen to work for White Wolf (or are big WW fans), as Malcom and Bruce are not the only ones I've seen. I always kind of assumed this was because White Wolf gets lot of flak even in the core GNS/Big Model essays, ergo, I can see someone who values the work they do for WW get kinda honked off at the Forge.<br/><br/>I also see this in varying degrees among anyone who has vested themselves in a methodology or body of theory that the Forge contradicts or critiques.<br/><br/>Of course, it speaks volumes to me when people can disagree rationally, rather than spew vitriol. My daily blog stops have been colored quite a bit by the nature of the writer's agreement/disagreement with the Forge.                        </div>

                            I had a similar experience when I first started here - the idea that since I hadn't spent X amount of years at the Forge and didn't (and don't) buy into the whole philosophy thereof - that I wasn't <i>not welcome</i>, but that I wouldn't be able to find a place here, either.  Andy convinced me otherwise, and I plowed through.<br/><br/>I think that Story Games has evolved into its own thing since then, but that doesn't mean that the same phenomenon doesn't apply to people finding it now.  Much more vigorous <i>welcoming</i> versus passivity is always a good idea in community.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As for 'freelancers'?  It's a very nebulous term, as JBR said, but it is a slice of the pie.  There's a quite large community on RPG.net of folks who have no intention of ever publishing anything on their own, but rather to find ways of fitting into the d20 model by working for Green Ronin or White Wolf or anyone else.  More and more this community is art-based instead of writing-based.  But look at it from their point of view: they're working for the traditional companies, who are continuously getting squeezed, slimming down lines and not reaching out for freelance work.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you have the folks who are going the self-publishing (i.e. 'indie') route, who don't need (or want) their expertise, and who may view them as cogs in 'The Machine', if you will.  There's no economic incentive for freelancers to embrace indie games unless we can demonstrate the need for their services.<br/><br/>As to Bruce Baugh - I'm not sure why he's on the list, having worked on what is ostensibly an indie game - <i>Dead Inside</i> by Atomic Sockmonkey.  But it may have to do with the whole <i>gestalt</i> that I mentioned above - if you don't have Forge cred, can you make an impact in the indie market?  Forge as brand, folks.                        </div>

I understand. I did not mean to make the fallacy that "All White Wolf folk hate the Forge," it was just a trend I noticed when made aware of a critic's publishing creds.<br/><br/>Granted, a trend of maybe 3-6 people, so it may simply be my bad expereinces with mostly Malcolm that make me want to believe there's a connection. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Um, that's Chad Underkoffer. And Chad has gotten some "Indie" cred without being a Forgeite -- he won an Indie RPG award and was a runner up in at least two other categories for Truth and Justice. And Artesia, a non Forge Indie game, won another Indie RPG award (presentation, of which there can be no question). <br/><br/>So, yea, the Forge dominates what this community thinks of as "Indie" -- but even here and at the Forge it isn't a 1:1. <br/><br/>(Also, I seem to have lost my copy of Dead Inside damnit.)                        </div>

                            This whole thread seems strange to me. We're too small a community to have "groups." We all know each other, so let's just consider each other individuals. <br/><br/>Consider this scenario. Ten years from now, some upstart starts giving his games away for free, and saying that anyone who isn't doing so is "sold out" and that their games can't be good. He says, "those guys at The Forge, they're just corrupt capitalists, and only free RPGS are ever going to be any good!" What's more, he has a good game of his own, it's bitten off a chunk of players who are really into it, and he's convinced a number of talented designers that it's the right way to go. A "freebie games" movement starts, based on this one guy, and those who best understand his ideas, surrounded by lot of other people who at least buy into them. <br/><br/>Now, here I am, still making "indie" games at that point, and I look at this community and say, "know what? Maybe they have some good ideas. I'll check it out." But I get there, and I don't understand their jargon, and don't really want to take the time to learn it (after all, I already have my jargon that's always worked for me), and some of the things they're saying seem very strange. After all, isn't selling a game a good way to distribute it? I'm accused of just not getting it. <br/><br/>I might find this new movement annoying. Depends. But I'd like to think that I could remain rational about it. I mean, I'd be pretty petty to rant against it simply because I felt that my "edgy" status was being drained away, wouldn't I? Isn't there always going to be some new movement?<br/><br/>OK, of course I'm talking about Ron Edwards and Bruce Baugh here. Or other parallels I could come up with. Note that it's very easy to say that Bruce isn't buying into it, because we're not bowing down to him as some sort of authority...but that wouldn't match my perception of his interaction with The Forge. We could say that The Forgies went out of their way to alienate Bruce...but that's not what I saw. Oh, sure, there were some folks who probably interacted with him based on the fact that they'd had awful experiences with game systems from WW with whom he was associated when they were produced. But for his part, Bruce always seemed to take it in stride (especially considering his personality). He had read Ron's essays that, yes, use WOD games as the whipping boy because they are emblematic of some things that he sees as a problem, but he still came and discussed things despite. <br/><br/>Was Bruce at The Forge being disingenuous? Trying to look like he was giving the ideas there a fair shake, and all the time intending to storm off? Not the impression that I got. And I don't recall him storming off, in any case. Oh, yeah, he and Malcolm are prone to tirades, but, then, I'm no saint either (and neither is John Wick, for instance). That's just personality. <br/><br/>Oh, and BTW, check out Bruce's Gamma World for the community rules. Amongst other cool things he's come up with. He's certainly not some sort of dinosaur who hasn't learned anything from newer games. Adventure! even has metagame player empowerment. <br/><br/>Have I missed him going off on The Forge or something lately on RPG.net, that his name is even being brought up here? If he has, do I care? <br/><br/>I think that it's interesting that we're looking for an enemy where there simply isn't one. Oh, there are folks that disagree with some things about the "indie" movement. But that, at least in theory, has always been desired, no? Or has Ron only using rhetoric with his exhortations that all rational debate should be heard out? Does Ron sometimes come across as heavy-handed in dealing with what might be an opinion in his view instead of debate? Sure, but with reason. Do some people see him as a tyrant for it? Yeah, but they've never talked to him in person. In any case, again, personality. <br/><br/>You know, if Indie Games or White Wolf were Islamo-fascist terroritsts, I might see the need to discuss who is on what side. But they're just guys producing TT RPGs by slightly different methods. And I've yet to find an actual publisher that I don't like (the FATAL guys being the exception that proves the rule). So I don't know what y'all are on about. <br/><br/>What was the topic of this thread again? Perhaps it was John's motive all along to point out the lack of any real divide between the "indie crowd" and those other guys who, before Ron, used to be the indie crowd? If so, all I can say is that, here's one, at least, who doesn't buy the hype or need any more drama about such insubstantial issues. <br/><br/>I think there might be some small minorities who feel that they have to defend the "indie" side of things, and another for the "WoD" side of things or "Traditional" side, because they think there's some kinda open warfare going on. I think those people envision Ron Edwards and Bruce Baugh meeting at GenCon, and throwing down in Aisle 1200. I think those people need to get real lives. Fortunately they're actually rare. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

From what I recall -- and this is hazy, so salt to taste -- is that Bruce's reception at the Forge was similar to my reception at the Forge, only a bit moreso, since Bruce's trad/mainstream credits list outweights mine by an order of magnitude.<br/><br/>To wit:<br/>1. Trad/Mainstream Game Writer (TMGW) comes into Forge.<br/>2. TMGW tries to learn the jargon and start conversations.<br/>3. TMGW asks questions previously discussed or ruled dead (which was unknown because, hey, new to the community).<br/>4. Forge community suggests TMGW do his homework of previously discussed/dead threads (in varying levels of politeness).<br/>5. TMGW attempts to do so.<br/>6. TMGW restates question or isolates specific unit for discussion according to forum culture.<br/>7. Either misuse of jargon or tripping over another revious/dead thread leads to repeat of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/>8. Repeat of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> (lesser levels of politeness, in general; didn't we tell him to RTFM???).<br/>9. Repeat of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> (decreasing levels of interest in doing homework).<br/>10. TMGW restates question again.<br/>11. Either:<br/>11A. Question dismissed out of hand as violating some precept of the community or misunderstanding some element of established community theory.<br/>11B. Community asks for further refinement of question. (TMGW complies. Repeat <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2311B&amp;Mode=like">#11B</a>.)<br/>11C. Discussion ensues.<br/>12. Community member mentions something in response that TMGW responds to involving his trad/mainstream experiences.<br/>13. Either:<br/>13A. Response disregarded because indie is seemingly thought of being completely the opposite of trad/mainstream.<br/>13B. Voluable lack of comprehension of why trad/mainstream experience worked that way.<br/>13C. Lack of interest in response.<br/>13D. Utter, vocal disregard of years of game design/writing by TMGW.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what I -- I'm not trying to speak for Bruce here, just personally -- often feel when I post something at the Forge is that while I've made the effort to learn the lingo, the effort is often unreturned to learn my background or lingo. <br/><br/>Also, while I don't expect anyone to "bow down" to my experiences as an authority, I -- and Bruce, too -- do have some experience in game writing and publishing -- in some cases, <i>significantly</i> more experience than community respondents. To have that ignored, disregarded, or actively belittled is frustrating, to say the least. A modicum of "well, that's interesting" goes pretty far.<br/><br/>In my case, the sense that I was putting in a whole lot more work to understand the community than the community spent in being open and interested in my experiences, plus the disregard or brushing aside of what I have learned in game design (and tried to express to community members), plus overly abstruse jargon, plus a difference in design work-process (I don't design in the open), plus what I see as a lopsided focus on design without equal balance for production, publishing, and marketing, limits my participation at the Forge to a monthly lurk or occasional post (usually in the Publishing forum).<br/><br/>But that's just me and my impressions. I'm not saying the Forge is eeee-vil or wrong or anything; just that the board seems to have a very insular culture, unsuited to this designer who designs in isolation.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

                            Chad and Mike, <br/><br/>I agree with Chad on his perceptions almost completly. <br/><br/>Chad, <br/><br/>OTOH (because I'm in a land of gods who have at least 4 hands), I can tell you without a doubt that you're talking to one of the guys on the Forge who was not like that. At least, wasn't like that to me. <br/><br/>First time I had significant contact with Mike is when I dropped in on him one day and asked to be in his HeroQuest game. He was hesitant at first, obviously a little wooged by sudden stranger asking to get into his stuff. Then he found out who I was, and saw my credits, and instantly gave me a whole different level of response. There was most certainly a degree of respect for my publishing credit, even if it was mainstream -- and I've seen him do the same with others. <br/><br/>Everyone, <br/><br/>Which is why the whole thing of "how folks percieve" is such a whack-o-mire. It also means its worth considering how your community, and your friends, talk.

                            [Edited to note ironic crossposting with Brand, who rocks]<br/><br/>Chad,<br/><br/>Sounds about right to me. That is, what you're saying is what I was trying to say from my non-TMGW perspective. That I could see how it could be frustrating, and how I don't see that you, Bruce, or anybody with a design history has become an enemy despite that frustrating encounter. Good on all of ya.<br/><br/>I think that the problems you encountered were not due to some intentionally insular overall culture trying to repel you. I think they were due to communications issues, and internet assholery, to which the Forge is far from immune. That's not to make little of your experience, but to say that I don't think that there was much of a way to avoid this problem that wasn't already being attempted. <br/><br/>People always say, be friendlier, be more open. Well, I know I can be kinda abrasive at times, but I, at least, am certainly not trying to run off anyone with your kind of experience. And I've gone out of my way to punch the shitheads that do this. If I've failed to be welcoming...well, I claim the humanity defense. <br/><br/>In any case, consider that sometimes on other boards, and not when I'm talking about Forge Theory, but even when I'm just recognized as that Mike Holmes, I get some asshat telling me that I'm a big doodie head for preaching my One True Wayism. So, yeah, frustrating. Do I blame the entire community in question for the act of the one individual? No, I just ignore the asshat. <br/><br/>Because that's about what we can do. People would love for it to be us against them. But it's only these idiots fighting the non-existent battle. Consider one of Ron's most angry moments was when some dolt decided to explain to Jeff Dee how his design notions were all screwed up, because they didn't support narrativism one day at GenCon, running Jeff (rightly) screaming for the hills. Jeff seemed to be on the road to joining forces with indie publishing - he'd actually already pretty much done it on his own with certain products. Since that day I don't know that Jeff has poked his head anywhere near "indie" gaming. Like I said, I've never seen Ron so pissed off. That somebody had misused his ideas to alienate somebody. <br/><br/>Gets my goat, too. I've seen people take shots at Greg Costikyan, Erick Wujcik, Robin Laws, and other designers who have braved the waters at The Forge. And it's like, "Dude, these are just these guys who love RPGs, and who have designed great stuff...the hell are you doing trying to make them look bad? You're only making the rest of us look like asshats, too. <br/><br/>It's funny, but I don't think that Story Games has a superior agenda or anything. I simply think that somehow it's been lucky enough that only the cool people from the Forge have gotten on board. SG is just refined Forge, to me. That's why I pretty much only post here nowadays. <br/><br/>Now, when inevitably I say something assholish, as I am sometimes wont to do, if you could do me the favor of cutting through my BS, and letting me know I'm being an asshat, that would be appreciated. Ron mostly did it at The Forge, so somebody else is going to have to step up here and take that on, lest I make the place less welcoming than it should be. For my part, I'll try to play nice. :-)<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Frankly, if someone's taking shots at Costikyan, Wujick, or Laws vis-a-vis game design or game writing. . . that person is either "young and feeling their rebel oats" or "a complete asshat."<br/><br/>(I mean, I hated Shakespeare in high school, finding him lame and over-praised, mostly because I was young and stupid.

                            Word.<br/><br/>I will say that Chad's experience on the Forge is 100% my experience as well, and I think that holds true for quite a few members of the second (third?) wave who joined about the same time.  I don't think those interactions were driven by intentional malace.  I had the exact same experience trying to join Mike's ongoing HeroQuest IRC game a few months ago, though I gave up after a few sessions of not feeling involved or integrated into the community.  I think it happens when any group of people are used to communicating with each other.  You just have a hard time incorperating new voices into the conversation, especially in an online community (where socialization happens way slower than in, say, a group of friends). <br/><br/>The first time I really felt like a valued member of the Forge was working the booth at GenCon in 2006.  That made me realize that relationships between the core members of the Forge, while initially developed over the interwebs, are heavily supported by historical face-to-face conversations. What makes you part of "the inner circle," so to speak, is not having published an indie game (though that helps), but, moreso, having sat down and played games with these guys.  I think, until you have done that, conversations only happen on a certain level.<br/><br/>To a large degree, I continued to try to connect with the Forge even though the Forge wasn't really connecting back to me for all those years previous.  Why?  Because I was a newbie and was willing to make the investment in order to learn and (someday, hopefully) be accepted and appreciated.  If I had been an experienced game designer, I probably would have taken a hike much earlier.  However, I eventually realized that struggling to enter the community was not actually the way to enter the community, ironically enough.  The way to enter the community is to design and publish indie games and, moreso, play them with folks in the community.  So I stopped reading the Forge a couple years ago, have hardly ever been back, but, somehow, I feel more like a member of the Forge now than when I was reading and posting constantly.<br/><br/>Weird, huh?                        </div>

                            Chad's experience is in fact a large part of why I consider myself to be a "Story-Games Guy" and not a "Forge Guy".<br/><br/>Which is <b>fascinating</b> since there's so much overlap.<br/><br/>Makes me wonder if there's something having to do with <br/><br/>a) population age (how long that population has been together under a given grouping mechanism, not the age of its members)<br/><br/>b) formative cognitive positioning techniques (Story Games definitely seems to lean hard on the Keep It Happy ethic; the Forge has always seemed leaner, more athletic, more intense -- all of which can be cues for something <i>feeling</i> aggressive even when it's not)<br/><br/>c) other factors of which i do not know and cannot ken                        </div>

<p>That's really super interesting, guys. For comparison, my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find the forge via Zak Arntson's spectacular Actual Plays.</li>
<li>I am like, 'huh, this is interesting', doodle around and skim the essays, and then jump in with a game idea I have.</li>
<li>Immediately I'm overwhelmed by the energy, intelligence, and positive atmosphere of the game critique legion. I learn a million things.</li>
<li>Meanwhile I have deliberately chosen to avoid questioning and using the jargon; I don't need it to say what I mean, and I'm pretty confident thinking that eventually someone will say, "Save yourself some typing by saying X instead of using that circumlocution you keep using."</li>
<li>Result: I feel educated and interested and none of that off-putting jargon business troubles me.</li>
</ul>
<p>To this day, when I talk with people at the forge and they don't appear confident in their language, I specifically avoid using forgey jargon; while refining and/or correcting peoples' usage is well-meant, I don't think that it benefits anybody to derail a potentially useful thread in the thorny bowels of language.</p>

I think this is a very dangerous point of view.  And seeing it echoed by folks here who I highly respect makes me want to speak up.  Both the Forge and Story Games have cultural values that have been fostered by their administrators.  I'm here and not at the Forge because I agree with the Story Game values and not the Forge values.  To suggest that this is just lucky for us, or simple Internet communications issues at the Forge is dangerous - it suggests that we shouldn't worry about how we comport ourselves here.<br/><br/>And we should; we should be conscious of how we approach each other and our discussions.

Precisely.  We can tolerate a lot more of that because Story Games is more a philosopher's salon than theory dojo.  So we can usefully rework old ideas.  And less temptation to reference a meandering thread that doesn't quite answer the question.                        </div>

I don't disagree with you in any case. What I'm saying is that those here seem to follow with the rules of comportment that you are citing. So, yeah, it's very important. <br/><br/>Anyhow, I think it's not co-incidental that the trouble that people had at The Forge really started, I think, about the time that some people's rates of posting dropped off. Paul Czege was one of the first to check out. Essentially it became too much volume for most people to handle dealing with entirely. So asshat posts started showing up without much or any challenge. After a while I gave up trying to read everything. Then about a year after that, I stopped posting much at all (in comparison to my previous rates). Since posting here, I pretty much only read or post to the Hero Quest forum there. <br/><br/>Even as obsessed as I am, I can't keep up with everything. Not even Fred, and his fast fingers can do so. <br/><br/>Ron saw this all coming, and told us to go form new communities. He knew that The Forge had reached a sort of level of critical mass where it was already fracturing internally, and the level of quality of discourse couldn't be maintained. What was needed is smaller communities. So here we are. Andy was (is) one of the more important Forgerinos. Yeah, he says that this place allows for a higher BS rate...but I find that the people here are so talented with communication, that this is fine merely because the people here won't abuse it. At the Forge, we all had to beat that into each other, to learn that. <br/><br/>What I mean by "luck" really, is that this place is very much like what the Forge was like in it's first couple of years with only slight differences. Basically it's managed to reproduce that same effect by narrowing the community to a monitorable level once again. We all know each other here once again. That's the key to high-quality communication. Like Jonathan said, now that he knows us, it's a whole different ball game. <br/><br/>I suspect that as long as membership here doesn't spread out of control, that the quality will remain very high. Does that sound elitist? Because it is. Asshats go home! Is that the same as saying that I want to disclude anyone who isn't part of some clique here? No. Just that people's participation should be considered by how well they're able to contribute. <br/><br/>Will the asshats see it that way? Well, of course not. To them any community like this, that doesn't like how they operate, is somehow evil. <br/><br/>OTOH...I am the guy who references threads. Sounds like I must be the problem Judson? Or are you really just against the asshats, too? If you're only problem with The Forge is that people reference threads instead of having the same conversation for the fifth time...well, I'm afraid we may simply be incompatible. Oh well, vive la differance. <br/><br/><br/>Chad, yeah, mostly they're younguns who think that tearing at the establishment - even if the "establishment" is Greg Costikyan - is good no matter what. Even if Greg is the guy who's promoting "indie" concepts in video game development for instance. Oh, they don't know that, but that's because they can't be bothered to read up on what he's really about. He's just been around forever, so he must be evil. <br/><br/>I believe the term is sophomoric. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            I don't think referencing threads is a problem, I think it's more when someone is referred to such a volume of threads that it becomes a major effort to participate.  Particularly where many of the threads then backrefer to others, it can take literally days to get up to speed and most folk won't bother.<br/><br/>That said, this issue is a nonstarter as tons of folk have said.  As for here and the Forge, the Forge is about supporting certain game designs [Edit:  This is apparently factually wrong, so ignore it, it's about certain publishing models], this is about kicking back with a martini and shooting the breeze.  It seems natural to me some people will prefer this, if you're not interested in designing the type of game the Forge supports and getting it out there the Forge isn't really aimed at you as best I can tell.<br/><br/>Of course, people are designing games here too which is cool, but at its core this always feels to me like a good bar with comfortable chairs and decent martinis.<br/><br/>I think once one recognises that the Forge is not a social outlet but a workshop for doing certain types of thing, it becomes much more explicable and if you're not looking to do that thing I doubt it will be much use.  Even if you are it seems to me overtrafficked these days, but that will sort itself out somehow I'm sure.                        </div>

<br/>
It is about no such thing. It is about supporting a specific economic model of publishing.<br/>
<br/>
You're right that it's about that goal as opposed to functioning as a social outlet. But what you've described as its goal is outright misrepresentation.<br/>

                            Huh, in the Forge as a brand thread Ron Edwards just posted with tremendous eloquence what I was trying to get at.<br><br>The Forge has a purpose, if you don't share that purpose it probably won't have much for you (I don't and so it doesn't for me, which is fine).  This place has a different purpose.  Other places have other purposes again.<br><br>That post is really worth reading, I shall now go and put it in the threads to watch thread, it is easily the best summation of the point of the Forge I have seen in years.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Actually, I'm the one you're killing inside by doing so. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Seriously, if I start having a conversation and someone says to me that they've had it many times before and that the solution is to go read something else, it seems reasonable that I might conclude one or more of the following things<br/>1) I'm being rebuffed. Specifically, that clearly there is a threshold at which this conversation can be had, and I am clearly not past it.<br/>2) I'm being talked down to.  As <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but with the extra special qualifier that clearly I have nothing to add.<br/>3) There's a very good chance this guy is full of shit because if it's been gone over that many times, he should be able to just fucking say it.  Since he can't, his position is pretty damn suspect.<br/>4) He's relying on dogma.  As <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/>5) You are deflecting and dodging my points, and creating a situation where if I protest, you will argue about whether or not I "got" the referenced material, rather than about the point I am actually interested in.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm a big beliver of citation as _secondary_ to discussion.  If someone can answer a question and say "if you are interested in this, here are some references to the topic." then great.  If those references go more than one place, than even better.  But if those citations are the entirety of the answer, they are a sign that the community has bloated to the point of being useless to anyone besides itself, and I really don't want that to happen here.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And for anyone who doesn't know, I like Mike a lot and am totally not busting on him here.  We are, i think, comfortable with disagreement. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Does that sound elitist? Because it is. Asshats go home! Is that the same as saying that I want to disclude anyone who isn't part of some clique here?

We're on the same page and reading in sync.  I'm all about meritocracy - because honestly, it has function.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I am the guy who references threads. Sounds like I must be the problem Judson?</blockquote>
As far as referencing threads, let me make an analogy to 20% of the problem with thread citation as a communication tool:<br/><br/>Q: I'm trying to figure out what the Cretaceous period was like.  Can anyone help me?<br/>A: Try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" rel="nofollow">this article</a><br/><br/>See how it relates, but doesn't answer the question?  Because maybe the respondent remembered there being facts in there that aren't really there?  Happens all the time on the Forge, in my experience.  So not only do you get the brush off, and spend 2 hours like a good muppet reading a transcript of someone else's conversation - which is not a great format to convey new information - but oftentimes it's infuriatingly pointless because, ultimately, your question isn't answered in the thread you were directed to.  Doesn't take long before "See this thread here" becomes a no op.<br/><br/>To paraphrase Dijkstra: "Naked Citation Considered Harmful."  <br/><br/>And as far as badly formed communication goes, naked citation is only one of several symptoms that I've seen on the Forge.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Or are you really just against the asshats, too?</blockquote>
I'm against the asshats.  It's just that I wouldn't limit that term to the newcomers at the Forge.                        </div>

On the other hand, I've often felt that if these threads were so amazingly important, someone should edit them into an article.  The that when they are cited, the point you're trying to get across be communicated, rather than be lost in the welter.                        </div>

                            On reflection, I don't think the reply by citation thing is as common as it used to be.

<p>My experience has largely matched Shreyas', though I first hit it out of design curiosity, not play:</p>
<p>1: I show up, I ask some questions and say some stuff about existing games.</p>
<p>2: I ditch my current game because it only hints at what I want it to do, and it turns out, you can just do what you want to do.</p>
<p>3: I continue asking questions and post designs for playtest, which gets me playtest.</p>
<p>4: My first game hits shelves.</p>
<p>5: Armed with a better understanding of the process, I start helping other people.</p>
<p>6: I start making another game....</p>
<p>My understanding of the super-special Forge jargon (which, look, it's not that complicated) was only hindered by people thinking it was a bigger deal than it turned out to be. The terminology is for specific but simple concepts. But these simple concepts were being taken by people with real interest in neither play nor concrete design and turned into Baroque palaces of concept. So Ron closed the Theory forum so people would get back to designing, publishing, and playing games.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Story Games is the tight game generator that the Forge has been for the last six years. Games have come out of here that people have liked. I've seen people howling with laughter playing Drowning &amp; Falling, which is a good indicator. And if there winds up being some serious critical culture here, this could work out great.</p>
<p>Story Games will develop cliques. Already folks in this thread are saying things like "I'm a Story Games guy". That's tying your identity to it, and that's making cliques.</p>
<p>I post here and I consider a lot of folks here my real, honest to goodness friends. Some of those I consider valuable colleagues. I know them from the Forge, too. This is the manufacture of clique, of tribe, and it's inevitable. Let's check in in five years and see what new lines in the sand are being drawn. Those lines will be really interesting. Some of those people might even think that they're getting away from all the line-drawing over at Story Games by drawing their own new lines, too.</p>

                            "Personally, I'm a big beliver of citation as _secondary_ to discussion."<br/><br/>Me, too. See, this is the problem I'm seeing. Are you speaking to me as someone who really produces a problem? Or showing the problem you would have if I actually did this? Because I'd find it hard to believe that anyone would accuse me of only citing and not contributing buttloads to the thread I'm in at the same time. <br/><br/>Now, maybe I have done what you've said above, somewhere before on the Forge. I may be simply selectively forgetting when I have not. But I will deny that I'm involved in any of the disingenuous intellectual activities you cite in your bullet list. If I cite, it's because I think it's pertinent, important, and useful (I may be wrong, but that's why I cite). <br/><br/>Now, if what you're saying is that it's your perception that I'm doing these things, even when I'm not, then...well you're actually asking me to rewrite my multi-thousand word rants every time they apply to anyone that I'm discussing them with? Just so that they have a better impression of me? <br/><br/>Frankly, if that's the case, I'd rather they think me an asshat. I really don't care all that much what folks think about me, or whether or not they feel welcome. If they've got a problem with perception about what's going on, it's because they haven't asked, and are making assumptions. Because, again, when I'm asked, I generally answer. Lots. <br/><br/><br/>What I'm getting at is this...I regularly see this thread pop up. In fact so much that I've considered making this response one of my standard rants to refer folks to each time it comes up. And what seems odd to me is that, Ron, myself, Ralph, Vincent, etc, etc, etc, are about as approachable as people can be in my experience (I'm probably the least talented here, but...). That is, as long as you're not being an asshat to start, then you can ask just about anything and get an answer from us. If we give an abbreviated answer, citing for instance, we're always available for follow up questions. <br/><br/>What I always see in these threads are these generalizations like, "People at the Forge." I haven't posted there regularly in a while (other than the HQ forum), and I'm still 5% of the posts there last I checked. Ron is more. Basically you can narrow down 50% of the posts at The Forge to a particular finite group of people that's not all that large. <br/><br/>If you have a problem with how you've been dealt with by one of us, the best way to deal with it is to send a PM or something to discuss it. Basically the only way that this problem of perception occurs is when we imperfect posters put something down in type, and one of y'all decide not to socially engage any of us, but just to decide that we're being asshats. <br/><br/>Well, there's really not anything any of us can do about that. I can't post any more than I do. Maybe I should just shut up and go away?<br/><br/>Here's what I find really incredibly ironic about all of this. By the time somebody gets up the nerve to actually post like this about how they've been alienated, they're usually so deep into the group that the condemnation seems ridiculous. Yeah, Fred left the Forge for a while. But you and he aren't part of the "indie movement?" Ridiculous. As much as you'd like to be "other" you're as much a part of this group as I am. <br/><br/>Jared claims to be part of some schism, but all I can see in him is like the aesthetic center of the movement, to say nothing of the fact that he's like the nicest guy of all of us, and everybody loves Jared. He's like the glue that holds this group together, all while standing in his own room talking to only one guy at a time and pretending to be in some other group. <br/><br/>And I know it kills him. :-)<br/><br/>More tellingly, Judson, having engaged intelligently and dilligently is part of this community too now, no matter how much he wants to be "anti-something-about-the-Forge." The proof of this is that whenever any such person shows up at GenCon, or at some other Forgie get together, suddenly they find themselves at ease with everyone else. Like Fred said earlier, right Rob?<br/><br/>It's just the damn medium, combined with standard social circle problems. And we can't fix that. So the problem is going to continue forever. Nobody's wrong on this. We theoretically could be more aware of our tone. You all could theoretically be more thick skinned and get to know us better. But that's just not something I think we can expect. Rather, I always ask for it, and then a year later this thread pops up once again right on schedule. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why I even bother saying it any more, now that I think of it. I'm probably somehow doing more harm than good. But it's my perspective, and there you have it for whatever it's worth. <br/><br/>You can say that it's the Jargon, you can say that bad cites are the problem. You can say that it's Mike's damn gruff exterior. You can say its Ron's occasional mental perambulations into terrifyingly controversial ground using language garunteed to incite people. But, in the end, if you want to be a part of this group it's about as hard as just being here (or at The Forge, or anywhere our tribe congregates) and posting, and accepting that we're not some clique of high school students. But folks who get to know an amazing number of people every year. No matter what their personal ideologies about RPGs are. <br/><br/>If it's not the personalities that make up the Forge community, then what are we talking about? I'm sure that I'm harder to get along with than the affable Andy Kitowski. But not that hard. If you have a problem with me, please, let me know. I'm sure everyone else who is part of "The Forge" feels the same. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

I've never claimed a lack of membership in the "indie movement".  I doubt Rob really means to make such a claim either.<br/><br/>It's whether or not we feel like we "belong" with the Forge.  I don't.  Rob has ably articulated why.  That's all.  And it's just an opinion.                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, my experience with The Forge echoes what Chad outlined above, with the added joy of being told that I wasn't "indie enough", because my self-owned publishing company produces d20 material.<br/>

                            I think that is also has to do with the phenomena that adding a new (vociferous) member to a group changes that group. People resist, because they don't like change. I see it all the time. <br/>
<br/>
At work when someone new with ideas joins the team. The old hands get sniffy because he starts pointing out the same old problems. The old hands feel he is suggesting they did not know what they were doing and won't ask questions to find out why they made those choices, or they don't want to explain again. The new guy feels the old hands are shutting him out. In gaming it happens when someone new joins the group. When Mike started posting over on the HeroQuest yahoo groups a few people reacted negatively to him. Here's this new guy we don't know telling us he has a different way of doing some of these things. I seem to recall he and Mark Galeotti had a few run ins. Now Mike's 'one of the gang' and has a credit in Mythic Russia.<br/>
<br/>
It's the same lessons we learned as kids. Joining the gang can be hard. Rejection sucks. Outsiders don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time folks work it out, sometimes they don't. Off-line its easier, you all go for a beer after work and the old timers clue the new guy in. And a lot of folks have clued into that here with talk about how the Forge works best after F2F meetings. Off-line it still harder to do. Continents and time-zones divide us. Written communication has no tone or inflection. Cultural differences are unknown.<br/>
<br/>
But this is nothing new.                        </div>
