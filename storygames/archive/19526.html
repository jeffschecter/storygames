Trooper<br/><br/>The Game:<br/><br/>Flashback 1: Last episode, the Danger Platoon parachuted into the Black Forest and Big Jack attempted to rescue Tembo from a Nazi patrol.<br/><br/>Flashback 2: In a previous mission, a dark ritual nearly sent Kilby back to Hell before Tembo broke the spell, gaining a d12 Artifact.<br/><br/>Flashback 3: On the astral plane, Kilby, Macha and Tembo saved Dr. Potato from a pit of clutching hands dragging her back to the afterlife.<br/><br/>Flashback 4: Years ago, Dr. Potato and Kilby built a psi-dampening helmet to save a teenage Macha from her out-of-control powers.<br/><br/>Flashback 5: Recently, the Psychic Assassin nearly made Big Jack shoot himself but Macha prevented it and earned a d12 Psychic Shield.<br/><br/>Turn 1: Big Jack vs. the Extra-Dimensional Enigma<br/>The Danger Platoon has tracked the Unearthly Trooper and his Horrific Squadron to an ancient castle in the Black Forest where he plans to tap its arcane energies and increase his Hypnotic Device's power. While sneaking in through hidden tunnels, Big Jack and Dr. Potato find dimly glowing runes etched into the castle walls. They decipher the language and discover the word required to stop their activation.<br/>Result: 8 hits (Threat defeated + The Word d12), 2 danger (Watched by Dark Forces 2d4)<br/><br/>Turn 2: Tembo vs. the Horrific Squadron<br/>In the castle courtyard, the Platoon is ambushed by armed Nazi zombie soldiers and a gunfight ensues. The Unearthly Trooper barks orders from a balcony until Tembo hexes his voice, driving him off-screen and removing his Horde bonus. Kilby's super-strength, Macha's telekinesis, Big Jack's fists and Judith's garrote keep the zombies busy until Tembo exorcises them all with the Artifact from his flashback scene.<br/>Result: 9 hits (Threat defeated + Winning d12), 2 danger (Hazard: Piles of Bodies 2d4)<br/><br/>Turn 3: Kilby vs. the Nazi Creature<br/>Kilby wants to fight it, so it suddenly comes smashing through a wall! They exchange insults as Kilby acrobatically dodges the Creature's gigantic fists, indirectly causing massive property damage. Tembo opens fire on it while Macha confuses its senses and Judith slashes at it with her Ever-Sharp Scalpel, hoping to score some replacement body parts. But before too long, the Piles of Bodies begin to interfere with Kilby's maneuvering and he ends up in the monster's clutches.<br/>Result: 6 hits (Threat severely injured), 4 danger (Crushed 3d4)<br/><br/>Turn 4: Dr. Potato vs. the Nazi Creature<br/>Kilby blasts free from the Creature's deadly grip with an explosion of Dark Powers! Big Jack staggers it with a Brass Knuckled punch to the back of the knee. As it stumbles, Judith gives in to her Undead Hunger, climbs up its arm, eats its face and steals one of its eyes.<br/>Result: 8 hits (Threat defeated), 3 danger (Losing Control 1d4, Hazard: Faceless Dying Nazi Creature 2d4)<br/><br/>Turn 5: Macha vs. the Psychic Assassin<br/>The defeat of his guardian shocks the Assassin into momentary visibility. Macha quickly engages him in a battle of wills while Big Jack insults and distracts him with Guns Blazing. The Assassin falls to his Weakness (Strange) and Macha fatally evicts him from his body, but also generates a new Threat. We decide to bring back the Nazi Creature, now possessed by the escaped mind of the Assassin.<br/>Result: 9+ hits (Threat defeated + another Psychic Shield d12), 5 danger (Threat: Nazi Creature returns)<br/><br/>End of Round: Threats vs. the Mission<br/>The Nazi Creature hits. It does appear to be unstoppable and is definitely impeding our success.<br/>The Hypnotic Device hits. We decide it's hidden somewhere inside the castle and that the Unearthly Trooper is about to activate it.<br/>The Mysterious Runes hit. They've begun to flare unholy light all over the castle walls and feed power to the Device.<br/><br/>Mission Status: 5 / 8 hits remaining<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434153/#Comment_434153" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T13:43:22+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  1:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2014 3:16PM by Seth_Magdich.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Turns 6-9: Recoveries<br/>Tembo and Macha recharge their powers, Big Jack reloads while muttering a prayer and Dr. Potato finishes digesting her latest meal.<br/><br/>Turn 10: Kilby vs. the Hypnotic Device<br/>The Nazi Creature roars and the Danger Platoon flees into the castle. They discover the bizarre Device within a mirrored room and are suddenly paralyzed by hypnotic visions of terrible alternate realities in which they are all enslaved or powerless. Only Kilby is able to endure the nightmares, Macha helping to shield him as he uses his Mechanical Knowledge to reach in and dismantle it. He tears out a fistful of extra-dimensional wiring and "energy plasma streams" before falling into a coma, the power of the Device fusing itself to his hand to create something we christened the "Hypno-Fist". At which point, the Nazi Creature suddenly bursts through the wall.<br/>Result: 8 hits (Threat defeated + Hypno-Fist d12), 6 danger (Taken Out)<br/><br/>End of Round: Threats vs. the Mission<br/>Rescue Kilby hits. We decide this means that the Danger Platoon never leaves anyone behind, though this is soon to be proven untrue...<br/>The Unearthly Trooper hits. The Creature drags Kilby to the Trooper's lab, where he's preparing to amputate the Hypno-Fist.<br/><br/>Mission Status: 3 / 8 hits remaining<br/><br/>Turn 11: Tembo vs. the Mysterious Runes<br/>Our heroes return to their senses and give chase. While the others charge after the Creature, Tembo follows the flow of mystic energy using his Occult Knowledge and discovers the nexus chamber of the Mysterious Runes. Macha links the Platoon telepathically and Big Jack tells him how to deactivate the Runes. Tembo enters a trance and speaks The Word. The castle shakes as their light fades and the room collapses in on him.<br/>Result: 7+ hits (Threat defeated + Mastered the Runes d12), 3 danger (Crushed by Falling Walls 3d4)<br/><br/>Turn 12: Big Jack vs. the Nazi Creature<br/>The Trooper and Creature / Assassin are arguing and blaming each other for the current situation when Big Jack bursts into the lab and starts punching. Dr. Potato is still hungry and starts chomping on the monster again. A half-dead Tembo appears in the doorway, wielding the Mastered Runes d12. The Creature is finally defeated, but the Assassin's mind escapes once again, this time landing inside the Trooper.<br/>Result: 6 hits (Threat defeated), 3 danger (Injured 3d4)<br/><br/>Turn 13: Macha rescues Kilby<br/>Macha enters Kilby's hypnotic nightmare and confronts visions of a parallel version of her own family, suffering unspeakably in the Unearthly Trooper's home dimension. She finally resorts to slapping Kilby with his own Hypno-Fist until he wakes up. And it works!<br/>Result: 6 hits (Threat defeated), 3 danger (Unsettled 3d4)<br/><br/>Turn 14: Dr. Potato vs. the Unearthly Trooper<br/>Everyone dives for cover as the Trooper / Assassin opens fire with his otherworldly pistol. Dr. Potato maneuvers next to Kilby and reroutes the Hypno-Fist's extra-dimensional energy plasma streams to create a portal back to the Trooper's home universe and send him back where he came from. Unfortunately, she gets a little too close and ends up falling in, landing next to her parallel self in an alternate-Nazi prison.<br/>Result: 3 hits (Threat off-balance), 6 danger (Taken Out (of the universe))<br/><br/>Turn 15: Kilby vs. the Unearthly Trooper<br/>Before the Trooper / Assassin can regain his balance, Kilby jumps up and grabs the portal with his Hypno-Fist! He throws the circle of black and blue lightning at the man's feet, casting him back to his own dimension! Using his Dark Powers, Kilby then shouts an incantation and closes the portal with a haymaker, reabsorbing it into the Hypno-Fist. He apologizes to Judith, but swears he'll reopen it and rescue her in the next episode.<br/><br/>Mission Status: Success<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
