Like if beach-front property being lame in the long run made them somehow different from other types of property (perhaps if they paid out less over time or some such), then the fiction would be informing the gameplay. As-is, you could say that beach-front stuff is lame, but it's mechanically identical to everything else.

There is such a thing as playing generously, selflessly. "<br/><br/>The point of Monopoly IS to win. At this point, you must concede that you are just playing "pretend tycoon/philanthropist" as Thurston Howell the Third. This may annoy anyone at the table who sat down to play Monopoly.<br/><br/>But I think the original question was " why AW needs it's clouds before it's boxes(pretending before rendering it part of the game, a la Moves). It's bound to happen anyway. Who cares when it does?"<br/><br/>I just listened to a couple of DW podcasts, so this is fresh on my mind.<br/><br/>In Monopoly, if you strip away all the theme and 'colour', leaving only numbers and neutral symbols, it would still function as a game. <br/><br/>In an RPG, sometimes the fiction INFORMS the rules. <br/>I state that my Character just Hack @ Slashes (a rule/move), <br/>I roll, I succeed, I do damage. <br/>Now I describe (fiction) exactly how my Character tumbles past the one guy to hit the other one.<br/>Whoah! Back up. That's Defy Danger. Different rule/move. I'm putting the cart before the horse. If I stated my fictional intent first, I would know which rule to apply.<br/><br/>Modifies of all kinds can be applied to rolls based solely on the established fiction, but you don't usually claim a modifier THEN make up some reason for having it.<br/><br/>"I get $4OOO for passing GO. Why? Well, my rich Aunt just died and left it to me". If  you want to pretend that's why you get $200 dollars, that's fine but it has no mechanical bearing on the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414960/#Comment_414960" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T22:07:54+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 10:07PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2013 10:24PM by noclue.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, acting like a monocled real estate tycoon in Monopoly doesn't do shit.

So what?  It can still matter to the group who enjoys the portrayal for its own sake."<br/><br/>That's your point, right?  I think it's a good point, and the only way to argue with it is to say what is ruined, very precisely.  So here's my best shot:<br/><br/>1) If I am portraying my tycoon, and that portrayal has no bearing on my progress in the game (winning, changing my character, being awarded MVP, addressing premise, whatever), then <b>it is less likely that any given player at my table will bother portraying their character or listening to me with interest when I portray mine</b>.  <br/><br/>2) It is often not possible for the actions I portray to have the consequences that I might want them to have -- like, if I'm portraying my tycoon as a ruthless bastard who will burn down your hotel when he stays in it, in hopes of costing you money.  In Monopoly, I can't actually cost you money or hotels that way, because the game rules don't care to support a persistent fiction.  So in playing my character, either (a) I have to <b>alter my portrayal</b> and not play my tycoon the way I'd like, or (b) I have to suck up the cognitive dissonance of having my tycoon <b>do something that I know won't work regardless of how it might look in the fiction</b>.  <br/><br/>"I burn down the hotel!"<br/><br/>"Okay.  Now it's my turn, and the hotel is still on the board."  <br/><br/>Ka-thud.  Most players won't bother to burn down the next hotel after that.<br/><br/>Do we then narrate how insurance paid for it and it was quickly rebuilt?  We could, but at that point, why are we playing Monopoly?<br/><br/>3) If I wish to do more than just act out my character for the group's entertainment -- if I wish to put myself in their shoes, think as them, and make decisions from their perspective -- then I want these decisions to matter.  I want them to work out well, or work out badly, or go as I planned, or surprise me, or I want to get new info so I can choose differently.  I want to be playing my character when the feedback comes in, reacting as them, in horror or anger or exultation.  I do <i>not</i> want to go, "Aha, in this situation, my character does <i>this!</i>" and then have the result be, "Yeah, anyway, moving on..."  How do I keep investing in my character after that?  <b>I made a big decision and I didn't get to impact or experience its consequences.</b><br/><br/>So that's my answer.  Those are the things I think "rules that ignore the fiction" ruin.  If you don't care about those things, or you play with a group that enjoys doing fiction for fiction's sake on top of game rules that ignore it, then I imagine these costs aren't relevant to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414972/#Comment_414972" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T23:50:45+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 11:50PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley  said "DIplomacy in Diplomacy seems to be a brutal, mind-shattering counterexample.

Any personal opinions or house rules for the game are irrelevant and a deliberate obfuscation or a "logic error"  in an attempt to prove a point or argue needlessly. Monopoly: The Role Playing Game exists only in one's mind and has no bearing on the discussion. I think we all need to be clear on this if this discussion is to have any merit.\n<blockquote>Does this mean that D&amp;D is (sometimes) not an RPG because (sometimes) other players will be annoyed with your roleplaying choices that are suboptimal and thus making the party risk death in level-balanced encounters?</blockquote>\n  Much to the same point as above; how other players wish to see/play D&amp;D is irrelevant. D&amp;D cares not one iota if we wish to (sometimes) reduce it to a tactical war-game. It is and remains an RPG, regardless of how we use it; teaching tool, tactical board game, recruiting tool for Satan, fore-play, political model for Democracy. It may EVEN be used to justify dickish behavior by players over what constitutes "sub-optimal tactics" (some would argue that is its main purpose ; ) \n<blockquote>But you may think in terms of "Ok, I really want to change X element of fiction.

An RPG often includes the option to change the fiction with -wait for it - MORE FICTION ! (sorry; it's a good point and I wanted it to stand out).

Roleplaying your tycoon in Monopoly, or using backstabby deals and diplomacy in Diplomacy, that's not clouds. Or maybe it's a small subset of clouds that are present in any game played by humans ever, but whatever. Clouds and boxes refer to the game state - what's true in the game.<br/><br/>- Here's what's boxes:<br/>AW: I just rolled a 10+ on my go aggro.<br/>Monopoly: Your piece is on Madison Square. It's my turn.<br/><br/>- Here's clouds:<br/>AW: There's a gun on the table. My character had a really mad look in his eyes when telling you to back off. No-one in Bud's gang has ever crossed that line before. I'm on the roof.<br/>Monopoly: My tycoon has a really ugly moustache. I always give a dollar to the homeless man on Madison Square when I pass. I carry kerosene to burn down your hotels.<br/><br/>Now, 'putting your clouds before your boxes' doesn't just mean that you talk about the cloud stuff first and the box stuff second. It's that the boxes reference the clouds. Looking up who knows the street you landed on (that info is a box) is required before you know whether you can buy the street (another box). In AW, looking up what this guy's house looks like (typical cloud info) is required before you can roll Defy Danger to sneak in (a box).<br/><br/>In contrast, none of the info in the clouds are ever required to use the boxes in Monopoly. I can always just say 'okay, give me the dice, my turn to roll' without caring about how my wonderfully roleplayed dinner with the mayor went.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So how about 'Just talking' influencing the game? That's outside the game state the clouds and boxes represent. If my character just yelled 'you'll never invade Poland!' so that your character heard it (even I just yelled it and didn't say 'my character tells yours \u2026') is different from me yelling it at you. In the example, both happened. In AW, the fact that my character told your is now part of the fiction, the clouds, and may affect the dice. In a Diplomacy-style game, any boxes you could call upon to invade Poland before - you can still call upon them. Maybe you don't want to, now, since you know I'll be really upset about it. Still it's definitely not the same kind of cloud as what's usually talked about. Maybe we want to talk about clouds, boxes and people?<br/><br/><br/>That's my take, at least.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415000/#Comment_415000" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T07:36:35+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  7:36AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Now, 'putting your clouds before your boxes' doesn't just mean that you talk about the cloud stuff first and the box stuff second.

The Romans had elephants. Gary gave the Celts a druid. In the middle of the battle, Gary declared, "The druid raises a funny-looking box, says some words, and turns the elephants into so much barbecue." (The line about "so much barbecue" is what sticks with me.)<br/><br/>Okay, hold it. I found the direct quote, sourced in a paper <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1984305/The_Paladin_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Dungeoneering_Modern_Enchantment_and_Paradox_in_Dungeons_and_Dragons_Submitted_Draft_" rel="nofollow">from here</a>...<br/><br/><i>I was the first one to come up with a violation of the basic concept of warfare of the period. We were fighting an ancient game. Very dull again. And I'd given the defending brigands a Druid high priest, and in the middle of battle, the dull battle, the Roman war elephant charged the Britains and looked like he was going to trample the army flat, the Druidic high priest waved his hands and pointed this funny little box out of one hand and turned the elephant into so much barbeque meat (Fine 13-14).</i><br/><br/>And I stand very corrected. It was Arneson, not Gygax, who came up with this. Which should be noted.<br/><br/>Naturally, it didn't go over well with the players, who balked at the sudden rules, change, but the <i>important</i> bit, in regards to this discussion, is the following: Dave took information from the "cloud" (i.e., "There is a druidic high priest") and brought it directly into the "boxes" (i.e., "the elephants die").<br/><br/>If you were to suddenly declare "my broker lays down kerosene around a hotel, and sets fire to it", and then remove the hotel from the board, <i>you would be doing the exact same thing</i>. Let's assume for a moment that the game was casual enough that none of you really cared about winning. So you burn down a hotel. Then other people start doing the same thing. And they start to interact with the Monopoly world as if it's a world that can actually be engaged with on a meaningful level. The rules no longer exist to declare winners and losers; the rules exist to provide reliable consequences for actions, and to provide creative constraints (e.g., "You may only move to these properties on your turn.").<br/><br/>That's when Monopoly becomes a roleplaying game. When you can say something that meaningfully interacts with the fiction of the game, when that fiction meaningfully changes something in the game. Anything less is window dressing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415039/#Comment_415039" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T12:35:16+00:00" title="May 30, 2013 12:35PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure, but doesn't "fiction first" just mean the game encourages the players to think about the fiction before thinking about the mechanics?

In a DnD4 battle, you would start by going 'I want to run over here, and then spend an action point to attack the troll' - mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415050/#Comment_415050" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T14:25:25+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  2:25PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the lively discussion.

I didn't mean to imply that (I put a lot of qualifications in my post), and I'm sorry that's how it came across.<br/><br/>Rather, I was making the observation that these rules-bendings point to something particular about roleplaying games--the need to allow action in the fiction to <b>matter</b>. The way that roleplaying games do that is by allowing fictional actions to have a mechanical impact. Sure, in the examples I mulled over, that mechanical impact came at the cost of breaking the rules. The latter bit is less important, and tangential to this discussion.<br/><br/>The important part, actually, is that system definitely matters. Without system, action in the fiction can't have a mechanical impact, a concrete impact. Without system, action in the fiction <b>doesn't matter</b>. (Well, maybe that's a bit overbold of a statement, but you get the gist.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415194/#Comment_415194" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T15:41:51+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  3:41PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [People arguing with Callan about fictional positioning and creative agenda]<br/><br/>WHAT YEAR IS IT<br/><br/>WHERE AM I<br/><br/>DISENGAGE DISENGAGE DISENGAGE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415216/#Comment_415216" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T21:04:34+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  9:04PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2013 9:05PM by DannyK.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming at it from the other angle, I've noticed that some Feats in D&amp;D and Charms in Exalted start off in my mind as having healthy portions of both fictional and mechanical impact -- say I've got a Exalted character with a custom combination of Charms that lets him parry, counterstrike, and intimidate his enemy all in one go, and it's got some cool special effects that go along with it, and it fits this character perfectly that he's the only guy in Creation who's got this specific combo.  This sounds awesome in the "lonely fun/gloating over my character" phase, but once play has commenced, and I end up using that combo all the time because it's the most mechanically effective gimmick on his character sheet, the fictional impact gradually drains away and it's just this thing he does - when he's fighting a dangerous enemy, he whips out his Spiteful Lightning combo. It still retains a certain flavor, about as much as the finishing move for a Mortal Combat character, but it's never the awesome thing I thought it would be during chargen.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, if one of y'all wants to write up rules for an AW/Monopoly mashup where you play sociopathic investors in the Boardwalk Empire mold, I'd totally play that.

Could just come during opening hours? Could just follow rules to do the exact same thing?<br/><br/>As I said above, I suspect the reason is that if there was a rule in the text where the player could, if so moved by the narration of elephant BBQ, remove his elephant from play, the fear in Arneson's actions is the other player <i>simply wouldn't</i>. Because he just wants to win. And so this confrontational, blunt rules violation thing tries to get around the gamist ignoring the idea of invoking mechanics (ie, the discarding of the elephant) simply by being influenced by imagination/clouds. Never mind that as we get into further indie developments these days, we basically have games that pay over stuff like drama points or such, if the player, following a rule that says he can give up the 'phant, does indeed do so. Ie, make being influenced by imagination/clouds supported by game currencies.<br/><br/><br/>John, if the whole elephant BBQ thing is fictional positioning, then I've been talking past people for a very, very long time (genuinely: maybe that's been the case?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415229/#Comment_415229" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T02:32:01+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  2:32AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2013 2:33AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So let's say I add a rule to Monopoly that says "in addition to paying the game currency for a new property, you must also narrate fiction about how it is built".  What does this add to play?<br/><br/>I think the answer is "nothing but a nuisance":<br/><br/>1) Narrating the construction of a building is easy, and boring.  It's a bad creative challenge.  No skills are needed.  If you choose to contribute a captivating narration, everyone else at the table will be surprised.  They might even miss it, because they were zoned out or going to the bathroom, expecting it to be boring.<br/><br/>2) The arc of situation-&gt;decision-&gt;action-&gt;outcome occurs entirely at the level of real people, rules, and dice.  If I don't see your character confronting a situation and wrestling with how to respond, if I see <i>you</i> make a decision instead of <i>them</i>, then that's where my interest has to fall -- on you and your dice.  I care about your construction foreman the same way I care about the thimble you move around the board.  I didn't get to see him grapple with the situation, so why should I care how it turns out for him?  I only care how it turns out for you, the player.<br/><br/>3) All the things we do in Monopoly adjust our position with respect to ultimate victory or defeat.  It's only by means of a known win condition that all this pushing around of fake money has any meaning whatsoever.  If players couldn't see themselves edging closer to winning or losing, no one would ever play this game.  Rolling dice and exchanging scraps of paper for other scraps of paper simply isn't that fun on its own.  So, if we're doing everything we do in Monopoly in order to win, how does spitting out required narration fit into that?  Basically, it doesn't*.  It's a separate activity entirely.  When you play a game, do you want to be required to do something totally unrelated?  Of course not.<br/><br/>*At best, it makes losers of those people without enough imagination to describe a hotel being built.<br/><br/>In an RPG, # 3 needs to change so that there are fictional ends to play toward.<br/><br/>In a creatively fun RPG, # 1 needs to change so that narration is at all interesting.<br/><br/>In a fiction-first RPG, # 2 needs to change so that the fiction can be the center of attention.<br/><br/>I can go on some more about why # 2 gives me underwhelming experiences, but perhaps the topic has moved on from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415231/#Comment_415231" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T06:40:25+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  6:40AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2013 7:28AM by Rickard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In an RPG, # 3 needs to change so that there are fictional ends to play toward.</blockquote>\nDoes it? In <b>My Life With Master</b>, the values increase up until a player can challenge the master and end the game. In <b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b>, a character is written out of the story if a skill reaches a certain value.\n<blockquote>In a creatively fun RPG, # 1 needs to change so that narration is at all interesting.</blockquote>\nTrue - to make a creative fun game the narration must be interesting. But as an example: is combat in <b>D&amp;D</b> narrative interesting? People argue here that Monopoly can't be narrative. That the narration should steer the rules. I can't disagree more. The rules can also steer the fiction, which I thought was <a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H%27s">@Nathan_H's</a> first point. "We shape the tools, then the tools shape us."<br/><br/>There IS a story taking part in Monopoly. It's just so obvious that people don't need to narrate it. It's the same thing as having hit locations in roleplaying games. If the game tells you that you get hit in the leg, then you don't need to narrate it.\n<blockquote>In a fiction-first RPG, # 2 needs to change so that the fiction can be the center of attention.</blockquote>\nNot really. You can have outcome-&gt;decision-&gt;situation-&gt;action where you roll dice to be able to make a decision of how a situation is created, and the fiction can still be in focus. It seems like some people in this thread are arguing from a locked perspective.  I also think that fiction-first is a buzzword. It doesn't mean anything so it's rather pointless to try to defend it. You can have outcome, decision, situation and action in any order and it wont matter when it comes to how important the fiction is. What you need, to make narration possible, is to leave holes in the boxes that must be filled in with clouds. I.e. you need to leave space in the game mechanics that must be filled in with narration to make the outcome of the game mechanic understandable.<br/><br/>I agree with Baker's <i>basic categorisation</i> of boxes (rules) and clouds (fiction) but putting clouds before boxes or vice versa is just a matter of preference.

For example, in Apocalypse World, there are moves which go 'Clouds -&gt; Boxes', for example, all the Basic Moves, and then moves which go 'Boxes -&gt; Clouds', for example, the Hardholder's start-of-session move.<br/><br/>"Clouds and Boxes" is not an exhortation to only have rules which flow from the fiction, it's an explanation of a basic feature of (nearly?) all roleplaying games.<br/><br/>That said, I think the essay also suggests that not having any rules which go 'Cloud -&gt; Boxes' does have a couple of deleterious effect on play, namely: <br/><br/>1) It's possible for players to completely ignore the cloud. This isn't always a problem since the stuff in the cloud is kind of the point of play, so people tend to be invested in it anyway, but you can get a thing where people lose focus on it during a particularly intense period of interaction with the mechanics, and it takes a certain amount of discipline to make sure the fiction keeps up. I've seen this happen in My Life With Master, and Vincent talks about it happening in In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>2) You can get a kind of "storyboarding" feel.

This isn't always a problem since the stuff in the cloud is kind of the point of play, so people tend to be invested in it anyway, but you can get a thing where people lose focus on it during a particularly intense period of interaction with the mechanics, and it takes a certain amount of discipline to make sure the fiction keeps up.</blockquote>\n I'm now mostly thinking of fortune-in-the-middle, which can be said to be Cloud -&gt; Boxes -&gt; Cloud, but I will ignore the tiny first Cloud and say, for this post only, that FitM is Boxes -&gt; Cloud.<br/><br/>When playing combat in any FitM based games, I noticed that people stopped narrating their actions after 5-7 turns and instead mainly focused on the outcome of the game mechanics. My guess is that this is happening because the players runs out of options and the  actions gets repetitive. Why should you narrate your eights attack which is pretty much the same as the previous ones? What the GM can do to solve this is to change the environment or otherwise add elements to the situation that the players must adopt to, or just plainly end the combat.<br/><br/>I've noticed that the same thing can happen in non-combat scenes as well, where the participants wants to use game mechanics to get things rolling. This goes whether you have Boxes -&gt; Cloud (roll to get things to start moving) or Cloud -&gt; Boxes (the situation comes to an end so another scene can take place). The solution to avoid this is the same though; you need to add more elements to the scene (or just end the scene). Perhaps by a revelation? Perhaps by  changing the mood? Perhaps by someone else is entering to stir things up? Perhaps by changing the environment?<br/><br/>I'm leaning more and more towards that talking about the order of Boxes/Clouds is like talking about breaking boiled eggs on it's larger side or on it's smaller.

There's a big preference in the player community for they player not saying the move, but the rule is that the move doesn't happen unless you do the fictional trigger. You can't roll Defy Danger without acting despite immanent threat, but there's nothing stopping you from saying, "I want to Defy Danger," and then explaining how you are acting despite immanent threat, or saying "I want to Hack and Slash the Ogre. I charge towards it, jabbing at it with my pike."

Hack and Slash, right?" or "I Hack and Slash orc <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. I just chop at him with my sword."

It sounds like interacting with the "box" isn't adding anything meaningful to the "cloud". The solutions being mentioned here (e.g. "the GM can [...] change the environment...") are part of what I consider game design: when we engage those "boxes", some meaningful change in the situation should always take place, so that you're not stuck making the same decision again and again. <br/><br/>This is one advantage of "stake-setting" games (as much as they're sometimes poo-pooed): you roll some dice (or engage some other sort of "box"), and something interesting changes.<br/><br/>Incidentally, while I agree with a lot of smart things being said here (particularly from Dave Berg and Rickard), I do think that "fiction last" games can be fun. I've designed and played some which were very entertaining. I think the key is making sure that each contribution somehow changes subsequent contributions, so that, when player A has narrated something, it meaningfully changes player B's options.<br/><br/>(Consider, for example, playing a scene in Fiasco: I -- or we -- narrate something freely, with no mechanical constraints. But then a die is given away, black or white, which will affect how the game will continue, what future narrations may or may not include, and what mechanical choices will be made in the future. For instance, if I passed the last white die, then narration of a future scene is likely going to be quite different than it would have been otherwise.)<br/><br/>(That's not the *best* example, because I think some people would argue that assigning dice after a scene is "mechanics informed by fiction", but I wanted to reference a well-known game. I've seen better examples in other games.)<br/><br/>Rickard, I'd love to hear why you think "fortune-in-the-middle-with-teeth" is a misguided solution to this problem.

The box can add something, like how the player needs to involve the use of a banana in the description of the action, but it will still be repetitive if the situation never changes. Using a banana seven times in the same situation isn't as fun as using a banana in seven different situations.\n<blockquote>I think the key is making sure that each contribution somehow changes subsequent contributions, so that, when player A has narrated something, it meaningfully changes player B's options.</blockquote>\nI'm totally with you. I always want the roleplaying game to create a "conversation" between it's participants. What I would like to add is this conversation can happen between the participant and the system, like the banana in the previous example. (I'm actually toying with the idea of a roleplaying game where the players plays against the game itself - <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a> have actually created one already.)\n<blockquote>Rickard, I'd love to hear why you think "fortune-in-the-middle-with-teeth" is a misguided solution to this problem. Have you written anything about this before?</blockquote>\nNot in English. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I do agree, from some of my experiences with FitM based games, that it can be boring. It doesn't matter how much I love <b>Feng Shui</b>, the descriptions during combat are really shallow. It doesn't matter if you describe how you throw someone to the moon, how you tear down the roof on top of someone or just tell the other that you shoot. That insight can decrease the fun of making descriptions.<br/><br/>My feeling is that people then came up with "with teeth" to solve this problem, but what they did was merely adding mechanics to the (randomized) mechanics. It feels like it's a solution that just patch things up when it should be fixed where it's faulty in the beginning. A game system shouldn't do the description for you if you want to play something narrative. For example, having narrow skills are devastating because you wont be feeling that you need to do a description of how you enforce the door if you got a skill called Lock Pick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415295/#Comment_415295" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-02T16:49:29+00:00" title="June  2, 2013  4:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I follow you, but I'm 100% sure.

How many description it takes to end the scene depends on a pacing mechanism, but I wont go into that. It's usually no more than one per player, if even that.<br/><br/>Each character has two moves which follows the theme of the character, that the player need to take into consideration in how the situation may be solved. Each description must also include three side effects which are basically to involve how something breaks in the scene, how someone gets wounded and something that makes things harder than the character first thought. The player can roll dice to remove the side effects, but the character will always succeed with it's action. A bad roll means it will challenge the <i>player </i>and not the character.<br/><br/>In other words, the game system gives a theme through the moves and up to three "bananas" that the player needs to involve but it doesn't tell how the theme and the bananas should be used. The player also need to adopt them to the current situation. You will probably use your dog or your precious notebook differently if you're facing cannibals compared to if you're stuck in quicksand. The dog and a notebook full of information are two examples of moves in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415299/#Comment_415299" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-02T18:09:46+00:00" title="June  2, 2013  6:09PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can someone inform/remind me what FitM with teeth means?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415302/#Comment_415302" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-02T18:43:45+00:00" title="June  2, 2013  6:43PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Ah, I see, Rickard.

Give me a weird creative prompt and I'll enjoy working the banana into the scene to show you all how clever I am.  But I won't forge any sort of emotional connection with that scene.  I won't be identifying with its characters or hanging in suspense on where it's gonna go next or mulling it over after play.  My banana narration is as disposable as my drawings in Pictionary or my pantomimes in Charades.  Sometimes that suits what I want out of a night of gaming.

It's the new hotness, a sort of Chez Geek or Munchkin style game where you try to kill off your family in the most horrible ways while having good things happen to the other players' families. And it's horrible. For exactly the reasons being discussed in this thread.<br/><br/>Bad enough that it's got that Munchkin thing "be the last person to be fucked" in the "strategy." But what really got me is that it tells you it's a storytelling game and you should add descriptions to the cards you play. For instance if you play "scarred by scandal" on one of your family members you have to say what the scandal is. And then the next person is supposed to build on that narration. But it's <i>completely irrelevant to the outcome of the game</i>.<br/><br/>The mechanics are "boxes to boxes" (appropriate for a board game, no problem there). But then the instructions are like, "Narrate cool stuff!" (clouds). Which is terrible, because there's no interaction between the two.<br/><br/>There <i>are</i> some good mechanics-first RPGs. I would cite both Contenders and Spellbound Kingdoms, at the moment, as being mostly mechanics-first. But they work fine because the mechanical stuff is both a) evocative and b) changes the fictional situation such that the players (including the GM, in the case of SK) have to consult the fiction to decide what to do next.<br/><br/>I think Vincent's point can be read not as "clouds first is alwayz bettar!" but as "there needs to be back and forth between the clouds and the boxes"\u2014that is, there need to be a healthy amount of both rightward and leftward arrows.<br/><br/>And while rules heavy games like Exalted (<a href="/forums/profile/DannyK">@DannyK</a> 's example is stellar), 3E and 4E, etc, have the "no rightward pointing arrows" issue, games with no leftward pointing arrows are also terrible! I would argue the lack of leftward pointing arrows is actually a bigger problem for "trad" games than lack of rightward pointing arrows! There are plenty of things in those games (I'm thinking of WW and GURPS here) that tell you, based on the fiction, <i>when</i> to roll. But outside of combat, it's almost completely unclear how a successful or unsuccessful roll is supposed to actually change things.<br/><br/>A good middle ground is found in FATE, Burning Wheel, and Dogs. Take Aspects in FATE: if you want to justify the use of an Aspect, you have to justify it with narration. But this feels natural and not tremendously arbitrary, IME, since the use of Aspects flows easily from the fiction and it doesn't have to be too crazy and elaborate.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Fiction Last - What does it ruin for you? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Fiction Last - What does it ruin for you? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Rickard, thanks for the link.

My guess is that this is happening because the players runs out of options and the  actions gets repetitive. Why should you narrate your eights attack which is pretty much the same as the previous ones? What the GM can do to solve this is to change the environment or otherwise add elements to the situation that the players must adopt to, or just plainly end the combat.</blockquote>\nContrary to jhkim, I think this is because the combat rules (or at least the system in practice) in such games are really boxes to boxes.  There's a certain amount of the fiction that's also dictated, but no more so than in a board game (e.g. Descent). </blockquote>\nSo we are in agreement that fiction is generated by combat rules.  However, you are saying that "clouds" in the model doesn't include all fiction - but only a certain level of fiction - specifically more than could be generated in a board game.  That seems like a potential source of confusion, because lots of combat description could potentially appear in a board game - even if it doesn't appear in a specific one like Descent.  <br/><br/>I don't disagree that the fiction created by boxes is the sort that could come from a board game, but I don't think that makes it irrelevant.  Really, I would say that mechanical results like "Arne is stunned and drops his axe" or "Ragash is killed" - are actually <b>more powerful and important to the fiction</b> than a lot of the typical cloud-only narration like "I scream my battle cry as I swing my hammer over my head."  <br/><br/>I'd go a step further than Rickard, in that even if the narrated moves aren't repetitive, players will sometimes lose interest if there is no consequence to whether you describe a raging sword swing versus a careful fencing thrust.  <br/><br/><br/>One approach to this is to try to make those descriptions important.  For example, I ran a Conan one-shot game called "Brawny Thews" where the PCs were all Cimmerians who were forced into gladiatorial combat under the eye of the Hyrkanian empress.  I ran through a big combat, but one of the important things in the combat wasn't just whether they defeated their foes, but how sexy they looked while they did so.  Ultimately, that was more important for their survival than their pure combat effectiveness.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415342/#Comment_415342" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T10:15:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:15AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I mean is that the way in which the fiction affects the mechanics is completely predetermined by the rules and is a relatively small set of finite possibilities.

I'd also agree that for certain games, freeform fiction declarations don't change the mechanical resolution.  i.e. In D&amp;D, it doesn't matter whether I describe myself spinning around to do a backhanded mace smash or closing in to do an overhand bash - both are still just an attack roll.  For that matter, these two aren't different in Dungeon World either - they're both the Hack and Slash move.  <br/><br/><br/>Different games will take freeform-fiction declarations into account.  At the extreme end, there are games like A Thousand and One Nights or Amber Diceless - where there are no mechanical options - the GM or GM-of-the-moment decides how things resolve based on freeform description.  In other games, description is only relevant for whether it triggers certain things or goes beyond certain bounds.  i.e. In Dogs in the Vineyard, you can bring in new traits or objects with appropriate description, but a lot of other details have no effect.  In My Life With Master, description matters for the die you bring in.  Other games recommend a bonus for description - like Over the Edge bonus dice for description, for example.  <br/><br/>It'd be interesting to rate different games on how much description changes the resolution.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415360/#Comment_415360" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T13:53:14+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  1:53PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jhkim, <br/><br/>The difference between most games' attack roll mechanic and the Hack and Slash move is that a GM can call for the former whenever a player announces pretty much any fighty-type action, while she can only call for the latter if a player is doing a fighty-action that a) sounds like hacking and slashing more than any other available move and b) sounds like it actually calls for a dice-roll at all.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415364/#Comment_415364" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T14:40:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  2:40PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 2:41PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, agreed on your last IIEE point.

Maybe opposed rolls where one character's action pre-empts another...)<br/><br/>Even when we need fictional info in order to roll, the expression of that info varies ("I shoot him" vs acting out the character's mood and style of action), and it seems to me that the factors separating colorful from perfunctory narration include:<br/>- group taste (duh)<br/>- system priming (rules that are quick and easy can kick players into "narrate" mode, while rules that demand tons of attention can kick players out of "narrate" mode)<br/>- precise arbitration of fictional positioning (does your elevation advantage apply <i>here</i>, given the <i>specifics</i> of what's going on?)<br/>- rewards for providing narration that is convincing (e.g. Within My Clutches bonus die) or exciting (e.g. Sorcerer bonus dice) to the other players<br/>- being given a talking stick (e.g. Swords Without Master), which sets everyone's expectations that it's time to narrate and listen to fiction<br/><br/>Although I agree with you about the problems of "no box-&gt;cloud" in trad resolution outcomes, I do think it's interesting to note that that is <i>the</i> most attended-to narration in roleplay: <b>the GM says what happens</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415366/#Comment_415366" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T15:17:41+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  3:17PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The difference between most games' attack roll mechanic and the Hack and Slash move is that a GM can call for the former whenever a player announces pretty much any fighty-type action, while she can only call for the latter if a player is doing a fighty-action that a) sounds like hacking and slashing more than any other available move and b) sounds like it actually calls for a dice-roll at all. </blockquote>\nNote that I wasn't saying that there were no differences between DW's Hack-and-Slash and a traditional attack roll - just that they had this particular feature in common.  <br/><br/>However, that said, I think it is completely in line with most traditional RPGs that the GM shouldn't call for an attack roll if they don't think the action is important enough.

In other words, the DM's move may depend on the player's description in D&amp;D, too. It is baked into the text of DW but I can also make GM moves in DW that are fictionally perpendicular to a player's description.<br/><br/>Part of the point of having a living GM is that players can elicit different fiction out of that GM based on how they describe their attack or who's comfortable passing the narrative around to whom and when.<br/><br/>I feel like some of the credit for caring about the fiction \u2014 for investing in it, reacting to it, making it potent or effective \u2014 is sometimes falsely awarded to games or designers. I think more of it needs to be awarded to the GM, even when the GM learned this or that technique from a well-aimed, well-written text. Even when the GM is conducting things according to the designer's vision. Even a DW can be bland or muddled when played by the book if what the GM says instead of the names of moves isn't exciting, compelling, a tour-de-force.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415378/#Comment_415378" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T20:58:53+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  8:58PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to note that AW/DW is slightly different from the way many traditional RPGs work because of the choices it asks the GM/MC to make when playing:<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, if I say I attack a monster with my sword, we pretty much always know that the sword will be swung (Execution) and that the d20 will be rolled to see if we hit. When the DM wants to throw in something unexpected, it will generally be at the Effect stage ("...but, for some reason, your sword just passes through her, doing no harm!").<br/><br/>In Dungeon World, when the player says he wants to swing his sword at the monster, the GM/MC has a few more things to consider. "What kind of move is this, exactly, and should we roll the dice or should I just respond with an MC move?" The MC may sometimes respond by "inflicting harm" (simply narrating how the target is hurt), sometimes call for the Hack &amp; Slash move, and sometimes call for some other move, like Defy Danger (or possibly even something like Defend, if I remember correctly). That choice depends very heavily on the fiction, so the GM/MC is going to be very likely to ask for more detail before she makes her choice. "He's helpless before you, dying quickly on your sword-point..." or "So, where are you standing, exactly? Oh, so the monster's higher on the stairs than you are, and you're swinging at its knees? That sounds dangerous..." Or maybe, "So you're attacking him because you want to keep him from hurting your friend?"<br/><br/>It's a subtle distinction, maybe, but I find it makes a difference. The GM/MC is much more likely to ask for more detail before she decides how exactly we're going to handle the situation, whereas in most D&amp;D games the player can pretty safely pick up that d20 and add their attack bonus, without fear that the GM (or anyone else) will say: "Hang on! We're going to handle this differently!" Sometimes they might, but it'll be pretty rare.<br/><br/>(I'm not sure if this applies as much outside of combat, however. It might be a trad/D&amp;D combat-specific thing in those games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415379/#Comment_415379" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T21:04:19+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:04PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I'd say that, yes, some games will often interrupt you before the Initiation phase:<br/><br/>Rolling initiative is one example (as you point). Having to make Will saves, or rolling courage, or rolling to break free of some effect, is another. Trying to cast a spell in combat only to have it fail because someone distracted you is another (I guess, perhaps a subset of the initiative thing). Having to pay resources or give up resources to do so is another (although it could be considered a retroactive Intent-interruption) - like when the GM says, "Wait, you have the Brave aspect. Here's a Fate point if you don't decide to high-tail it out of there after all!" Finally, any game where you must test some character attributes (like "Faith" or "Courage", or "Total Lack of Self-Control" or "Roll to act under fire, because you just can't keep your eyes off of her") before you manage to take action are another. Consider something like, "In order to attack the Giant Scary Thing-that-cannot-be, you must make a Fear save first" in this light...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415386/#Comment_415386" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T21:47:41+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:47PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 9:50PM by DanMaruschak.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is perhaps a quibble and kind of a sidetrack to the discussion, but whether or not a <i>Dungeon World</i> move gets invoked is not a decision for the GM alone:\n<blockquote>Everyone at the table should listen for when moves apply.

If I'm hanging on a cliff or in the middle of a cave-in, then I'd expect some changes in resolution for both Dungeon World and other games.

The game kind of breaks down if you're not describing a fictional component to the move as well as the mechanical component, whereas a game like D&amp;D can truck along much more steadily if it happens to become purely mechanical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415398/#Comment_415398" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:49:10+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 10:55PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree with Dan. The most obvious example is this:<br/><br/>You're in a fight with something nasty. You say you want to attack it. In D&amp;D, we roll initiative and then we roll to hit - what else would we do?<br/><br/>In DW, the MC (or the group, as Dan points out, but I think most often it's the MC who's thinking about it hardest*) needs to decide: who's got the initiative here? Are you free to act, to attack the monster while it's off-guard? Or is it the monster, rather, who has the momentum, and the character is reacting to whatever it's doing?<br/><br/>In the first situation, it's more likely to be a Hack &amp; Slash move. In the second, it's more likely (though not always) to be a Defy Danger move.<br/><br/>Let's say we have a knight who rushes into a dragon's lair and wants to attack it. In D&amp;D, we roll initiative and fight! The mechanics (whether the initiative roll itself, or number of squares moved vs. movement rate, when on a battlegrid) will settle this question for us, there's no need to think too much about the fiction or to ask further questions.<br/><br/>In Dungeon World, the MC's got to think: OK, what's the danger level here? Is the dragon staring intently at the entryway, while the knight stumbles in, looking around for it? (In which case he might have to dodge some dragon breath first... Defy Danger just to get into range to hit the thing.) Or is the knight coming in at the dragon from a direction where can get close enough to hit it before it can breathe its fire on him? (Hack and Slash.)<br/><br/>Since there's no initiative roll, the MC is likely to want to establish some more details about exactly how this is all happening to see which move she wants to call for. <br/><br/>Another example: In D&amp;D, if I sneak up on an enemy from behind, I get a bonus to hit, they get no Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and I might get a damage multiplier. In DW, though, there's no such thing - the MC can't just say, "Ok, roll with the attacking from behind bonus, and your target doesn't benefit from their shield". Instead, the MC will choose the move she thinks best represents the situation: in this case, maybe there won't be any roll at all, but instead the MC might just "inflict harm" or "offer an opportunity with or without cost" ("Ok, you can get close enough to slit its throat, but only if you drop the torch: it's very sensitive to heat, and that would give you away"). But the MC will be choosing something that's more likely to be in-fiction (like the slit throat example) than a pre-defined bonus (+4 to hit from behind), since those are the tools given to her.<br/><br/><br/>* : The reason I say this is because it comes up specifically when it's the MC's turn to talk. "Ok, I do this! What happens?" And now the MC has to say something, which is when she's supposed to make a move. So wondering about which move to make is a very natural question.<br/><br/><br/>[A quick edit: Yes, fundamentally this does come down to a question of GM skill, as well. However, I feel that, in DW, making this kind of consideration is fully in line with the rules and the way the game works best. In D&amp;D, doing something like the above example would be clever GMing, but arguably against the rules and/or procedures of the game, particularly in a combat situation being run "by the book", where appropriate bonuses and rulings are already defined.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415400/#Comment_415400" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:59:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:59PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 10:59PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An interesting counterpoint is that games which do define a lot of fictional circumstances mechanically (e.g. "-2 penalty for using your off-hand", "+2 if you can brace your weapon against something solid before firing", etc.) also prompt the players to add a lot of detail to the fiction, in a different way.

It's not unique only because it tells you it's conventions - conventions that can be, and sometimes are, as easily used in other games as well.<br/><br/>*World is pretty much a traditional game, told in an untraditional way.<br/><br/>(I feel the same way when I'm reading about people talking about boxes/clouds and what fiction-first really does. Yes, you're totally right if it's seen from your perspective only, but just because it's right from that angle, it doesn't mean it's a general rule.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415409/#Comment_415409" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T00:27:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:27AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Rickard.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, because I agree with you: Dungeon World is a pretty traditional RPG overall, and in most respects it's not that different from, say, regular D&amp;D. What I do find interesting is that there are some minor, subtle differences in the way that moves work: specifically, MC moves. For instance, you wrote, "talking about using a dagger, a short sword... just specifies <i>what</i> you can do in combat." That's true, but there's a subtle difference between that and my examples. When a player says he's using a short sword, that's done: we now all know he's using a short sword (with all the attendant bonuses and penalties the game describes, like rolling 1d6 for damage). In my examples, though, the player makes a choice, and then the MC has to make her own choice in response ("which move do I respond with?"). My argument here is that this is likely to prompt the MC to ask further questions, establish more details about what is going on, whereas in hypothetical D&amp;D-like game we'd often just nod and roll the dice.<br/><br/>My examples were posted in response to John, who asked for some. I don't know if they satisfy him or not!<br/><br/>(Much of what I'm saying about Dungeon World is also true of more freeform or older editions of D&amp;D, as well, I think. It's not necessarily Dungeon World-specific.)<br/><br/>Here's another example: <br/><br/>Game A<br/>* When you hit someone with a sharp weapon, roll 1d6 for damage. If you exceed their total hit points, they're dead. If not, they're wounded but still alive.<br/><br/>You can well imagine how it will go when someone gets hit with a sword, right? There's not much to ask. We roll and then we describe it in some detail, if we want, but we can just as easily skip it.<br/><br/>Game B<br/>* When you hit someone with a sharp weapon, the GM will describe the severity of the damage, and tell you how soon your victim is likely to die from the wounds (which could be right now or later).<br/><br/>In this game, I'm sure you will see more GMs going, "Uh... ok, let's see. So, how are you cutting him, exactly? Are you sticking your sword into his leg, or trying to cut his head off?" And then they have a little conversation, maybe the player describes how they're swinging the sword. Maybe the player will ask what kind of armour his opponent is wearing first, or which way they're facing, because that would affect how they're going to hit them. <br/><br/>The GM needs to describe the effects of the injury, too, or the player will ask: "Hang on! Did I get him? Is he bleeding? Is he still alive?" <br/><br/>It's a different process, in my experience. Not every single time (maybe sometimes they'll look the same), but generally it'll tend more towards a different sort of conversation between the player and the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415418/#Comment_415418" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T06:45:15+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  6:45AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To be fair, in D&amp;D, what I say as the DM on a hit or miss \u2014 on a bit of damage or a lot of damage, and whether I make optimized plays for my monsters or not \u2014 often depends on the player's description.

In D&amp;D, we roll initiative and fight! The mechanics (whether the initiative roll itself, or number of squares moved vs. movement rate, when on a battlegrid) will settle this question for us, there's no need to think too much about the fiction or to ask further questions.<br/><br/>In Dungeon World, the MC's got to think: OK, what's the danger level here? Is the dragon staring intently at the entryway, while the knight stumbles in, looking around for it? (In which case he might have to dodge some dragon breath first... Defy Danger just to get into range to hit the thing.) Or is the knight coming in at the dragon from a direction where can get close enough to hit it before it can breathe its fire on him? (Hack and Slash.)<br/><br/>Since there's no initiative roll, the MC is likely to want to establish some more details about exactly how this is all happening to see which move she wants to call for.</blockquote>\nThis is an interesting difference in how we experience D&amp;D play.  I'm not that big a D&amp;D player, but I've played a fair amount over the years.  Even if we're not using a grid map, I find that the group will often sketch out a rough map of where things are and place themselves.  Then the players will ask all sorts of questions like this about the situation - like what different features on the map are (i.e. "What's that squiggle?"  "That's a tree."), and especially facts that could get them some sort of tactical advantage (i.e. "I'm getting behind the tree to get a cover bonus").  <br/><br/>If there is a grid map, that makes more things mechanically specific - but I find that a map often generates more questions because there is more detail to resolve.  i.e. "How high is the bar?"  "How deep is the water there?"  etc.  This is often at least as much detail as I see established in my Dungeon World combats.  <br/><br/>This probably comes down to a difference in between our experiences.  I've played two Dungeon World one-shots, and am 6 sessions into a campaign.  It's quite possible that both our D&amp;D experience and our Dungeon World experience are quite different than each others'.  I appreciate that you express the difference as "the MC is <b>likely</b> to want more..." - but again, I think likelihood is difficult to establish.  There isn't a strict rule difference on this, and the MC could establish initiative without established more detail than the map and description that a D&amp;D DM gives at the start of a combat.  <br/>\n<blockquote>Another example: In D&amp;D, if I sneak up on an enemy from behind, I get a bonus to hit, they get no Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and I might get a damage multiplier. In DW, though, there's no such thing - the MC can't just say, "Ok, roll with the attacking from behind bonus, and your target doesn't benefit from their shield". Instead, the MC will choose the move she thinks best represents the situation: in this case, maybe there won't be any roll at all, but instead the MC might just "inflict harm" or "offer an opportunity with or without cost" ("Ok, you can get close enough to slit its throat, but only if you drop the torch: it's very sensitive to heat, and that would give you away"). But the MC will be choosing something that's more likely to be in-fiction (like the slit throat example) than a pre-defined bonus (+4 to hit from behind), since those are the tools given to her.</blockquote>\nI feel like there are two countering effects at work here.  In general, the mechanics are more abstract / less detailed than most traditional RPGs.  A Dungeon World MC has bigger decisions to make - such that they have to decide who has initiative at all, rather than giving a bonus to initiative.  <br/><br/>That does mean that the effects from pure-fiction description are likely to be bigger in DW.  To counter that, though, I find that the MC is less likely to give away such effects.  In other words, I'm much more likely to be able to talk my D&amp;D DM into giving me a +2 bonus for special circumstance than I am to talk my DW MC into letting me slit an enemy's throat without a roll.  <br/><br/>In many ways, this echoes the Old-School versus New-School D&amp;D debates.  The Old School crowd tend to argue that not having clear rules for the situation results in more active rulings from the DM that enhance the play experience, while New-School (3e and 4e) tend to argue that the greater detail forms a stable baseline that let's the DM concentrate on other details.  I tend to stay out of these except to pipe in that it's really a matter of taste and that both can be good.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415444/#Comment_415444" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T10:32:42+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 10:32AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I'm in agreement with you: the difference I'm describing is a pretty subtle one (given two games where one is trying to emulate the other), and two games could look pretty much the same. It's also very closely related to the New-School vs. Old-School debate. <br/><br/>I still think that the D&amp;D crowd would have an easier time skipping over the fiction than the Dungeon World crowd, though: when you have an initiative roll to fall back on, you don't have to talk about the fiction, you can just let the dice sort it out. <br/><br/>This happens in Dungeon World with some moves, too, but not as much as in [later versions of D&amp;D], as we can see from examples like initiative rules.

I would never bother to specify that I'm using my <i>right</i> hand to do something in Dungeon World, maybe, but I'd make sure to mention it in this hypothetical game.

A D&amp;D game and a Dungeon World definitely have *different* fiction detailed.  I just find that in my experience it roughly balances out to roughly the same total amount of fictional detail.  <br/><br/>To check again if we're on the same page, I am talking about fictional content regardless of whether it has associated mechanics.  So, for example, if I take cover from the dragon's flames behind a boulder, I consider that to be a fictional detail regardless of whether there are rules for taking cover or not.  This as opposed to the view that taking cover is just boxes-to-boxes with no fictional content if there are rules for it.  <br/><br/>Many people don't like the flavor of mechanically detailed combat like GURPS or Riddle of Steel or similar, and prefer more rules-light games.  However, I disagree with the theory that such games lack fiction and are mostly just rules/boxes with no meaning. If I move my figure six hexes to behind the tower wall, that is roughly equivalent to my verbally saying "I move behind the tower wall."  Both of those are statements about the fiction that change the fiction "cloud".                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415480/#Comment_415480" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T18:26:34+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  6:26PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People play games to have fun. But generally they can't just determine what actions would lead to the most fun and do them -- if people could easily discern that they wouldn't need games. What they do, when they engage with a game, is the same thing they do in any complex system -- try a bunch of stuff, observe the results, choose a goal, and choose actions that seem most likely to get them to their goal based on their observations.<br/><br/>The job of a game designer is to make sure that the actions people choose are likely to produce fun. This means they have to identify people's likely goals and make sure that doing "fun" stuff advances you towards those goals. That way, when people advance towards their goals, they'll also enjoy themselves. If you don't do this, you'll see people doing stuff that they don't enjoy and that upsets other people and blaming it on you. The classic example of this is grinding for experience or cash in World of Warcraft. People don't do it because it's fun, because it isn't fun -- but they view it as the most efficient way to accomplish their goal, so they do it while simultaneously complaining that they're doing it!<br/><br/>Vincent believes -- as I do -- that imagining a story together, and paying attention to all the details, and making it feel real, are fun -- maybe the most fun you can have in a roleplaying game. So he designs games where the most effective route to accomplishing your goal is to imagine a story, pay attention to details, and treat it as real. One important way to do that is to require people to refer to details of the fiction to use the mechanics. (Dog Eat Dog does this with Judgement.) I think Vincent goes further and argues that your game should fail to resolve entirely if people don't pay attention to details of the fiction. I am not sure this is necessary or meaningfully different.<br/><br/>You don't HAVE to do it this way, but if caring about the story isn't on the action flow, then many people won't do it -- and even those who do actively do it, because they like it, are more likely to forget when they're under pressure, because in moments of crisis their eyes will turn towards the choices that will advance their goals first. Lots of people try to roleplay in D&amp;D sometimes, but when push comes to shove, will they talk, or pull out their wand of fireballs and chat afterwards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415486/#Comment_415486" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T19:06:25+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  7:06PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>In old D&amp;D or any sort of OSR thing, that sort of interpretation from the GM is fine and expected, but in new D&amp;D it's cheating (even if it helps the players!).</blockquote>\nI don't follow you.

A powerfully described attack might make a monster sheepish or enraged, it might cause enemies to want to rally to save their leader or abandon their prisoners. The DM can still take action, make moves, and create fiction that respond to the fictional inputs of the players without having to "cheat" to do it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415504/#Comment_415504" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T23:57:34+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 11:57PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2013 2:47AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, of course. It's not all or nothing, black and white. It's a spectrum, from very tightly bound to the fiction to very loosely bound. These points on the spectrum are <b>game design options</b>, not political statements or categorizations of game play.<br/><br/>Vincent uses the term "teeth" to talk about a mechanic that grabs on and helps you do something (like the teeth in a gear). Moves in AW (most of them) have teeth this way, in terms of a tight bind to the fiction. If you don't engage in the fictional details, the mechanic doesn't work right. The teeth don't line up, the gears grind. So you go back and say the stuff you need to say so the mechanic can work.<br/><br/>Describing your attack details when you use a power in D&amp;D 4th isn't like that. The description is <i>optional</i>. Of course you can do it in play. And it's good when you do it. And it can have a significant impact on the game. But it's still optional, (solely) in terms of the game design behind that mechanic. <br/><br/>This isn't a matter of what you can or should do in play. It's a technical element of game design. Does the attack power have teeth or not? Is that choice the right one for your design? Design questions! Not game play manifestos.<br/><br/>All of this "fiction first" and teeth talk comes from discussion of game <i>design</i>. And then a bunch of people go running off and claim stuff about games in <i>play</i>, as if it was the same thing.

Do they want what I want out of this game that can be played any number of ways?<br/><br/>So, if one is into manifestos for <i>anything</i>, this doesn't seem like a bad topic to me.  If someone said, "let's take all these cool games and form a group and play them Fiction First!" I'd be like, "Hell yeah!"  I mean, even if our definitions of Fiction First aren't quite the same, the statement of priority is non-trivial (in my experience).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">@Nathan_H</a>, I've found that this thread has gotten me to think about what I like about "fiction first", what's necessary for that, and which game elements tend to help or hinder.

If you exceed their total hit points, they're dead. If not, they're wounded but still alive.<br/><br/>You can well imagine how it will go when someone gets hit with a sword, right? There's not much to ask. We roll and then we describe it in some detail, if we want, but we can just as easily skip it.<br/><br/>Game B<br/>* When you hit someone with a sharp weapon, the GM will describe the severity of the damage, and tell you how soon your victim is likely to die from the wounds (which could be right now or later).<br/><br/>In this game, I'm sure you will see more GMs going, "Uh... ok, let's see. So, how are you cutting him, exactly? Are you sticking your sword into his leg, or trying to cut his head off?" And then they have a little conversation, maybe the player describes how they're swinging the sword. Maybe the player will ask what kind of armour his opponent is wearing first, or which way they're facing, because that would affect how they're going to hit them.<br/><br/>The GM needs to describe the effects of the injury, too, or the player will ask: "Hang on! Did I get him? Is he bleeding? Is he still alive?" </blockquote>\nIf I look at the last paragraph and compare that to your first example. Is the number of hit points open? If not, why shouldn't the GM in Game A give a description that suits the damage? How severe is 6 damage? Does it remove a limb or will it just be a flesh wound?<br/><br/>The thing is that I think it's important to tell the players the consequence of their attack. To give some kind of feedback. But this is <i>my</i> convention and I can't say it's a general rule. I do think that the moves in *World creates this naturally, and I think it's a smart game design to show (or more likely: program) people in how to play the game. In how to embrace a convention. D&amp;D lacks this (or at least leaves it up to the GM to find out).<br/><br/>Why I spoke up in the first place was because of the notion that clouds must come before boxes to make something narrative interesting. I will quote something your wrote some time ago.\n<blockquote>2) The arc of situation-&gt;decision-&gt;action-&gt;outcome occurs entirely at the level of real people, rules, and dice. /.../ I didn't get to see him grapple with the situation, so why should I care how it turns out for him?<br/><br/>In a fiction-first RPG, # 2 needs to change so that the fiction can be the center of attention.</blockquote>\nNow, look at what <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> just wrote about AW above: "If you don't engage in the fictional details, the mechanic doesn't work right."<br/><br/>That's exactly what I'm saying. To make fiction interesting, you need to leave holes in the mechanics that the fiction must fill in. But what I'm also saying is that it doesn't matter if the fiction comes before or after the fortune (or option, if dice-less). Just because *World has fiction-first, it doesn't mean that that's the <i>only</i> way to do it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, that's why I'm saying that designing "with teeth" in mind can be to overdo it, but I'm saying that because the existing games with "teeth" overdo it. (That's not true, because <b>Kagematsu</b> handles teeth exceptionally in certain points. I can talk about that in another post.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415532/#Comment_415532" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-05T11:36:02+00:00" title="June  5, 2013 11:36AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">@Will_Hindmarch</a>: So, are you saying that you think that the D&amp;D 4th power usage and the Go Aggro mechanic are at the same point on the spectrum?

But there are play goals for which it matters a great deal.<br/><br/>When I say "fiction first" I mean "fiction as a top priority", not "fiction precedes rules use, chronologically".  That said, I do often find that the latter abets the former:<br/><br/>- If you're into "I am one with my character" play, then you don't want to establish an outcome first (by rolling or whatever) and then narrate it into the fiction second, unless your character can see the future.<br/><br/>- If you can roll first without establishing a ton of fictional context, and get something useful out of the roll, that breaks the connection between narration and progress.  Rule-use becomes the way to move forward in the game, with the fiction guest-starring as needed.  That may sound abstract and theoretical, but my experience absolutely backs it up.<br/><br/>- Some of the fiction-fostering techniques I mentioned earlier rely on talking first and rolling second.  Detailed situational modifiers: some games really force us to see what's happening in the fiction before we know whether the roll gets a +2 or a +3.  Audience/judge appreciation: some games allow our friends to help us make a roll only if we thrill them with our narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415566/#Comment_415566" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-05T20:26:25+00:00" title="June  5, 2013  8:26PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>You lost me in your last post (and your second quote isn't anything I ever wrote). But, in short, I agree with what David wrote (just above this post).<br/><br/>My main point was what you were saying:\n<blockquote><br/>[Narrating meaningul fiction in response to game rules being engaged:] But this is <i>my</i> convention and I can't say it's a general rule. I do think that the moves in *World creates this naturally, and I think it's a smart game design to show (or more likely: program) people in how to play the game. In how to embrace a convention. D&amp;D lacks this (or at least leaves it up to the GM to find out).<br/></blockquote>\nI agree with what you wrote futher down, saying that the methods we're discussing aren't the only way to do it (make engaging fiction that's not irrelevant to play). I'm sure there are others! (And Kagematsu is quite an interesting example of that, as you mention.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415580/#Comment_415580" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T04:50:47+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  4:50AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(and your second quote isn't anything I ever wrote).</blockquote>\nAh, sorry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415587/#Comment_415587" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T06:25:38+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  6:25AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is the number of hit points open?

The interactions of the players themselves. Dice, numbers, words, maps - real-world tokens, things, props, representations. Emily calls 'em "cues" and I think that's just right.</i>  This was confirmed by example of a people-to-dice rule of <i>Here's a rule: "2. Subtract the roll on the damage die from your character's hit points."</i><br/><br/>Vincent:  I agree that you aren't including formal procedures per se, but you did include numbers, words, and maps besides just dice in your third category.  <br/><br/>I still pointedly disagree with this.  Here's the simplest example: <br/><br/>1) A player picks up his miniature figure, and without saying a word moves it six hexes on the map to just inside a map of a building.  <br/>2) A player verbally says "I run into the building."  <br/><br/>I would say that both of these are contributing the same thing to the fiction, but the diagrams imply that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is a people-to-dice operation totally different than <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> as a people-to-cloud operation.  Likewise, your example of marking off damage is said to be purely on the dice side, but I think that taking damage to your hit points has an understood meaning in the fiction - even if the exact details aren't specified.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415628/#Comment_415628" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T16:50:24+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  4:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2013 4:53PM by lumpley.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If losing hit points has an understood meaning in the fiction, then obviously there's a line that points into the fiction.

That way the both start at the same time, skipping some of the 'why do clouds have to start first' stuff. Depending on mechanics (which includes social contract agreements to ignore textual rules (or even includes flat out bullying events into play, ala the Arneston example)), each line sometimes swerves over and bumps the other before returning to it's parallel. Sometimes bumping each other even because they were bumped before. Back and forth in various complicated patterns that are very particular to each RPG (though as with the gloom example here, sometimes the lines just don't interact at all...just strangers walking in the same direction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415632/#Comment_415632" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T18:24:57+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  6:24PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If losing hit points has an understood meaning in the fiction, then obviously there's a line that points into the fiction. Same with moving the miniature. Duh.<br/><br/>That very hit points example appears not halfway down the page.</blockquote>\nYou have two examples of damage:<br/><br/>"2. Subtract the roll on the damage die from your character's hit points."  (claimed as people-to-dice only)<br/>and<br/>"4. If your character takes damage greater than 4 on the damage roll, he's knocked down." (claimed as people-to-dice plus dice-to-cloud)<br/><br/>As I said, I believe that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is wrong - because hit points of damage has meaning to the fiction even if the character is not knocked down.  The character has taken damage from the attack, and we know something about the severity of the damage based on the fraction of hit points lost.  In general, I think a much bigger deal is being made out of the dice-vs-cloud distinction than it should be - though maybe that is your point.  <br/><br/>For example, you note in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> that being knocked down or not is only a part of the cloud in the diagram.  However, consider use of Paizo's <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ddq" rel="nofollow"><b>Condition Cards</b></a> product.  If you use these in your Pathfinder game, then it changes how the arrows go - because now being knocked down is represented by a card, and so is also on the dice side of the diagram rather than being just a cloud thing.  <br/><br/>I think that this shift is being read as a more fundamental difference of game design than it really is.  Condition Cards are an interesting product, but I don't think they change the game that much.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission" title="EndTransmission"><img alt="EndTransmission" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/428/nBVTR0D284U65.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission">EndTransmission</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415637/#Comment_415637" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T19:15:04+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  7:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I still think that the D&amp;D crowd would have an easier time skipping over the fiction than the Dungeon World crowd, though: when you have an initiative roll to fall back on, you don't have to talk about the fiction, you can just let the dice sort it out. <br/></blockquote>\nTalking about the "D&amp;D Crowd" like a unified phenomenon/culture verges on hilarious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415644/#Comment_415644" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T20:24:36+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  8:24PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So let's say I add a rule to Monopoly that says "in addition to paying the game currency for a new property, you must also narrate fiction about how it is built".

Like there's some fiction that exists out there, somewhere, and we're referencing it. I mean, maybe peopl are talking about the fiction that's in our heads, but I see no use in talking about any fiction in an RPG that isn't shared. Shared, meaning we've all shared it with each other. <br/><br/>For example, if I lose 4 hit points, that doesn't mean anything in the fiction until we state what it is. Given hit points (talking in D&amp;D here) are some amalgamation of luck, ability to turn what would have been a severe blow into a lesser one, and physical trauma, amongst other lesser things, until I say what specifically this blow is it could be any combination of those things, and probably means something different in everyone's head at the table. Maybe it doesn't, but until someone says something, we can't know. All this I've said is nothing to do with boxes to clouds, or clouds to boxes. That's all rules, and not phenomena at the table.<br/><br/>Clouds are our shared fiction, People are people and all that entails like the way we gesture and the fiction in our heads, and the boxes are the physical implements of play like dice, tokens, and miniatures. For the difference in arrows leading which way in our examples of D&amp;D (ha ha, like it's one thing) and Dungeon World we have to talk about the rules, not what might happen at our game table. <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the rule is "To make an attack roll, make a standard action," so far arrow essentially going people to people, "and roll a die," people to boxes, "and add your total attack bonus," boxes referencing more boxes, because we're talking about a physical implement of play, our character sheet with its numbers, "and compare it to the target's AC," boxes to boxes, again, "if you roll less than the target's AC, you miss," boxes to people, kinda, "if you roll greater than or equal to the target's AC, you hit. Roll your weapon's damage die," boxes (numbers on the dice and character sheets) to more boxes (rolling more dice, as informed by your character sheet or rule book, both physical implements), "apply the damage to the target's hit points," boxes to more boxes. The reason we can say there are no arrows pointing to the clouds is because the rule never states to address the fiction. We probably will, sure, but not because a rule said so, and the rules are what the arrows are. If the rule said something like, "On a miss, you swing wide. On a hit, unless you've said otherwise, your weapon strikes the opponent in the centre of mass," that's an arrow pointing at the fiction (passing through people, cause of the if), even if we don't say it in the end. I hit, and the rule said I strike the centre of mass. I didn't say anything otherwise, so that's what is in the fiction.<br/><br/>In Dungeon World, the text for H&amp;S is fairly different in it's arrows. "When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+str," clouds (something stated in the fiction) to boxes (dice and number on my sheet), "On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack," boxes to both boxes and clouds, "at your option, you may deal +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy's attack," people to boxes and clouds, "On a 7-9, you damage your enemy and your enemy makes an attack against you", boxes to boxes and clouds. In the fiction, on a 10+ you've avoided their attack or exposed yourself, your choice, but the rule addresses that shared fiction. On a 7-9, we know in the fiction that the enemy makes an attack against you. The arrows directly and overtly involve the clouds.<br/><br/>This so far has nothing to do with "fiction first". Fiction First means we care about the clouds. They are our most important bit, our first bit. It doesn't mean we're looking for arrows leading from clouds to boxes, it means we're looking for all of the arrows to have something to do with the clouds, somewhere. All of them, not just some of them. And again, this has to do with what the rules are, not with our personal methods of play. Nothing in the world can account for those except us, individually in our own play.<br/><br/>I hope I've not butchered your meaning anywhere, Vincent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415649/#Comment_415649" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T21:19:19+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  9:19PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2013 9:19PM by Emily_Care.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>1) A player picks up his miniature figure, and without saying a word moves it six hexes on the map to just inside a map of a building.  <br/>2) A player verbally says "I run into the building."   </blockquote>\nI see (1) as tactical positioning.

This is a clear explanation of what I disagree with.  <br/><br/>I claim that the attack roll, modifiers, and miss <i>by themselves</i> have meaning in the fiction.  We might not have the details of it, but we know that character X tried to attack character Y with the designated weapon, but failed to land a damaging blow.  It is possible to add some color to this, like "The blow swung wide" or "The blow glanced off his plate armor" - but even without that extra bit of color, there is definite information there that is a part of the fiction.  <br/><br/>Really, I would say the information about who attacks who, who damages who, and who kills who is all stuff that is vital to stories, in my opinion.  Even if the only information we knew from the fight was that Tybalt made a sword attack on Mercutio and reduced him to -5 HP, that is by itself key information for the fiction, even without extra verbal description about how the blow landed.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415655/#Comment_415655" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T22:29:08+00:00" title="June  6, 2013 10:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>1) A player picks up his miniature figure, and without saying a word moves it six hexes on the map to just inside a map of a building.  <br/>2) A player verbally says "I run into the building."   </blockquote>\nI see (1) as tactical positioning.

The procedures and practice of play involve taking snippets of one language or another and  interpreting / translating them in order to generate another snippet. The process of translating between languages enriches what can be expressed by breaking the limits of a single language and offering new perspectives. That means play with cycles like: A -&gt; B -&gt; A -&gt; C -&gt; A will be more likely to be enrich by this translation process than A -&gt; A -&gt; A sort of play, which discourages players from thinking outside the constraints of one language or another.<br/><br/>That is a powerful conclusion regardless of whether:<br/><br/>A = poetic dialogue<br/>B = natural dialogue<br/>C = theatrical mime<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>A = map-based movement<br/>B = dice and modifiers<br/>C = 3rd person narration<br/><br/>Which makes me somewhat baffled when folks canonically describe one particular language as the fiction - it seems to disregard the entire process of interpretation and communication.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415660/#Comment_415660" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T04:46:52+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  4:46AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel: YES                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415661/#Comment_415661" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T05:11:54+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  5:11AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Conversely, just because we're using a hexmap doesn't mean that it is pure tactics with no character.

A cross example I was thinking of where physical movement has directly fictional effects was a tabletop freeform called the <a href="indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?action=printpage;topic=24714.0" rel="nofollow">Sea of Doubt</a>, inspired by some ideas of Jonathan Walton. Moving a piece around on the board gave thematic input that was helped to frame a scene. Technically, I'd say it did have mechanical implications (we invoked a rule by moving the piece which gave us procedures to follow "incorporate X theme"), but it was narrative in form therefore having a fairly direct, unmediated relationship with the fiction. <br/><br/>It is interesting though that interpretation of some sort is required for this kind of move, just as it is when a character "loses hitpoints". Imo, the big difference there is that in one case the effects are mediated by mechanical implications (I'm in range/I'm out of range, thus they get/don't get a numerical bonus), and in the other invoke human judgement and open-ended creativity. I think JW is using the word "deterministic" for this kind of player based choice. (Please correct me if I'm using that differently from your usage, JW)<br/><br/>I have not played Amber, except to once make characters and then fail to play. I'd be curious how the drama-based mechanics in it fall out in terms of mediated vs. choice. I can imagine the negotiations in that game being pretty fierce.<br/><br/>Mendel addresses this all beautifully.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415662/#Comment_415662" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T06:44:53+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  6:44AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I claim that the attack roll, modifiers, and miss <i>by themselves</i> have meaning in the fiction.

If the narrated fiction doesn't contribute enough to the outcomes we care about, then that has its downsides, regardless of whether Step 2 was a die roll or just another player taking their turn to narrate.<br/><br/>This seems like a good time to mention that <i>formal</i> versions of Step 2, while perhaps the easiest to spot and critique, are not the only potential impediments to potent and prioritized fiction.  If every time you talk, I then ignore what you said and do something else, we have the same problem, even if the activity is all narration.  Personally, I haven't run into this in pure freeform since, like, middle school, but I'm sure experiences vary.  <br/><br/>I <i>have</i> run into some narration-trivializing with <i>very</i> limited formal procedures, though.  In <i>Penny for My Thoughts</i>, there's a structure there that can steal some story focus if you let it.  I saw a few initial memory narrations fail to cohere because the group was more invested in "which player gets to say how it turned out?" than in the spotlight character's journey.  In some ways, <i>Penny</i> is about as fiction-first as it gets: you spend all your play time narrating, and the ultimate points of interest are the fictional fates of the characters and their memories.  At the same time, the game leaves it up to the players to create the causal links between one narration and the next.  Personally, I enjoy this challenge -- communicating to the other players what's relevant to me, or taking in what's relevant to another player so that I can propose a meaningful resolution -- but I definitely see the value in rules that do some of that work too (e.g. "action X may produce outcomes A, B or C").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415677/#Comment_415677" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T13:28:41+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  1:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2013 2:39PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a>, if you move your Monopoly game piece onto Marvin Gardens and pay the bank for it, you have established the "fictional facts" that your tycoon has purchased a property.

The Swedish dude is happy for the Swedish moments, the Finnish dude is happy for the Finnish moments, and I'm happy for the English moments.  Everyone gets something they already dig.  We get to see each other's different skills.  We get to throw more disparate elements into the mix.  At the same time, we may cohere less.  Maybe I'm playing for the English parts, and just kind of going along with the rest, while the Finnish guy is playing for the Finnish parts and doesn't really get into the English stuff the way I do.<br/><br/>If, instead, the game is just English, then the other two players may simply tire of all English, all the time.  "This would be way better if there was a little Finnish thrown in."  "Swedish too."  At the same time, if I can demonstrate all the fun I'm getting out of English, maybe I can inspire them to up their fluency, and get more out of English than they did before.<br/><br/>Is "use multiple languages" just one tool of many, to be used or not depending on one's intended audience?  Or do you think its virtues are broader than that, possibly inherent to game play?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415727/#Comment_415727" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T07:01:56+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  7:01AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><br/>1) A player picks up his miniature figure, and without saying a word moves it six hexes on the map to just inside a map of a building.  <br/>2) A player verbally says "I run into the building."   </blockquote>\nI see (1) as tactical positioning. It's manipulation of real world, in-game components/cues etc., which can have fictional &amp;/or mechanical implications. Fiction can certainly "come last" where this kind of action is involved. And in many games the fictional element omitted all together (chess, checkers, sorry, etc.). Memoir '44 and hardcore sandboxy rpg play are interesting border cases. I can see someone playing with solely verbally symbolic "pieces" (character, monsters etc.) looking at them as though they were real world minis.</blockquote>\nAbout the last part - yes, that is exactly my point.  I've played a fair amount of Amber Diceless, so verbal tactics aren't a theoretical possibility to me - I see them in action.  <br/><br/>Conversely, just because we're using a hexmap doesn't mean that it is pure tactics with no character.  You apparently assume that any move on the hex map is just tactical positioning, that isn't my experience.  I've also seen a lot of Champions play where characters moved and took actions for personal reasons rather than tactical ones.  </blockquote>\nHrm. This tangent has got me thinking a bit about how particular boxes ( miniatures) interact with the cloud stuff and why in the past I've had such a had time about describing some stuff that seems really obvious to me ( but apparently few other people) when it comes to get more story out of miniatures.<br/><br/>A couple of examples:<br/>1) Creating characters and using minis<br/>1a) The usual procedure: Start with cloud (character concept) -&gt;Pick miniature (box)<br/>Problems: There never an exactly right miniature. Anything will actually do ( penny, marker, jelly bean). Here the box is in no way informing the cloud.<br/>1b) My suggested procedure: Start with box-&gt;Build character based on inspirations by appearance(cloud)<br/>Difference: Here the actual appearance of the miniature informs and is part of the basis for the cloud. If your box happens to be a green jelly bean, that matters. What character is based in some fashion on a green jelly bean&gt; ( All sorts of possibilities actually).<br/><br/>More broadly, the total collection of boxes ( all miniatures and related toys) in form the greater cloud of the game setting and situation from the jump off.<br/><br/>2) When on table placement of miniatures (boxes) isn't just about tactics, but also about cloud stuff ( Actual Play inspired)<br/><br/>About the set up: A party of heroic Victorian Adventurer types is leading an expedition into a Lost World type setting. They are accompanied by a group of British soldiers.<br/><br/>About the boxes: The four adventurers ( main characters) have all been created using the box-&gt;cloud procedure I talked about, and each miniature is unique. The 10 Soldiers are all old war gaming miniatures, all in the same pose.<br/><br/>The specific scene: The group is setting up camp in the dinosaur/lizardmen infested jungle in a clearing.<br/><br/>Using the boxes tacticaIlly: Box(es) [the miniatures] -&gt;[procedure: move them around the physical space]-&gt;Intent[ Have them ready to interact in a tactical battle if it occurs]-&gt; Go to combat rules [Box?] when this inevitably happens. mostly box to box stuff. somewhere in there maybe the odd moment of cloud getting in there.<br/><br/>Getting More cloudy: Use Boxes to set up positions of people in the camp [this looks almost exactly as above]-&gt; Cloud : "Private, go gather firewood"-&gt; okay, this is where it gets cloudy, so I'll just explain a bit.<br/><br/>OK, at fist glance both these things look essentially the same. You got little toy men, they're setting up camp.<br/><br/>But, in the second example, you've just specifically chosen one of those sort of indistinguishable chaps from the army to go off alone and gather firewood. On a dino infested planet.<br/><br/>It's a big dam flag or call back to genre tropes right there. It isn't tactical ( I suppose it could be, but probably not), it's a call to have one of about a dozen things that almost always happens when a nameless extra in an action movie goes off alone in the woods in a dangerous region. That's all cloud. And it's significantly different from what it would mean if one of those distinctive characters based on a miniature went off alone to gather firewood.<br/><br/>This then would be an example of boxes informing the cloud, correct? Rather than simply going mostly box to box (minis movement plus rules procedures) , with only very minimal cloud reference?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415728/#Comment_415728" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T08:26:21+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  8:26AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Miniature movement or a similar type of play is actually an interesting sort of thought experiment.<br/><br/>Here's ruleset A:<br/><br/>There's a map, coded in various colours, including orange and green.<br/><br/>Each unit moves 3 hexes on the map per turn.

In Euro-style board games, players do indeed forget the theme.  However, in my experience, miniatures players are very much aware of the details they are simulating.  They can talk for ages about it - and sometimes do.  <br/><br/>This is a very old argument that is dragged out whenever someone is comparing themselves to a more rules-heavy system.  They generally believe in a "sweet spot" between too many rules and too few, but everyone disagrees on where the sweet spot is.  HERO System players will say that Phoenix Command is too detailed, while OSR players will say 3E is too detailed, and Amber players say that all of these are too detailed.  So it's OK that Dungeon World has no rules for differentiating the damage between a sword and a fist, but it is important that there are rules for distinguishing between the damage of a fighter and a thief - when that could just be handled descriptively as well.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415820/#Comment_415820" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T14:00:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  2:00PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I'll bow to your superior experience in this case (you've played a lot more games with a lot more people than I have).<br/><br/>However, I'm specifically not talking about rules-heavy vs. rules-light: I think some rules promote more detailed fiction and some do not.

Three ideas for why this might happen in part (with some overlap):<br/><br/>Perhaps it is a little bit because of complexity creating specificity as some other posts suggest\u2014the complexities of wargame rules serve as a reminder that they are simulating something, and at some point in the scale of simplification that produces a euro there is a balance point for most players that tips the rule from specific to abstract.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is something related to, but distinct from, the classic "creative agenda" that is produced in the culture of the games in question.<br/><br/>Or perhaps it is a question of something a lot more delicate, how evocative the rules themselves are for that specific situation. Is it about the relationship between minis, maps, hexes, and math to the way that we experience war (as viewers in media or as participants of one kind or another) that makes a good wargame feel completely right in a way that euros don't? Or something about the athletic pressure of measurement and calculation\u2014the intensity that is lost making euro-games effortlessly accessible\u2014that makes the situation feel real?<br/><br/>Those all seem like ways that games might produce something like fiction without the cybernetic cycle of boxes and clouds\u2014and things that make fictions feel important even with, right? Even just the importance of the miniature as an object, this little detailed person, is a reminder of something. Monopoly, as the example, is handicapped in all three\u2014generic game and commonplace, non-specific mechanics, dysfunctional culture, imprecise simplified simulation and\u2014the pieces aren't actually people.

I totally agree that Dungeon World's lack of differentiation between swords and fists (or whatever) is likely to lead to less detailed fiction.<br/><br/>That's the interesting thing about the "clouds vs. boxed" concept: it's a tool for looking at how specific rules implementations shape the dialogue between the players involved, which few people discussed previously (at least in my limited exposure to RPG discussion).</blockquote>\nYou're distinguishing here between more detailed fiction and less detailed fiction.  However, less detailed fiction is still fiction - and indeed that more detail isn't always superior.  I agree that the cloud-and-dice diagrams can be useful, but I would say that from their very first expression, they have had a fundamental mistake.  One example is that "A attacked and wounded B" is a statement of fiction - even if more detail isn't layered over that.  <br/><br/>So I'd say that we have to look at the diagrams a little more closely.  <br/><br/>Two examples that I'd like to drill down into via the diagrams are the beginning phase of Fiasco, and the whole game of Happy Birthday Robot.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415899/#Comment_415899" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T10:23:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 10:23AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I don't find this to be true as a general rule.

Three ideas for why this might happen in part (with some overlap):<br/><br/>Perhaps it is a little bit because of complexity creating specificity as some other posts suggest\u2014the complexities of wargame rules serve as a reminder that they are simulating something, and at some point in the scale of simplification that produces a euro there is a balance point for most players that tips the rule from specific to abstract.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is something related to, but distinct from, the classic "creative agenda" that is produced in the culture of the games in question.<br/><br/>Or perhaps it is a question of something a lot more delicate, how evocative the rules themselves are for that specific situation.</blockquote>\nI'm sure that all these have an effect - along with robb's point about in time investment and komradebob's point about use of representative / evocative miniatures.  <br/><br/>In my mind, this relates to many arguments of map-based combat versus non-map-based combat in RPGs that back decades.  Arguments for non-map-based included that it was more creative and freeform.  I don't do map-based combat very often these days, but I still find it often very evocative and creative.  The contrast of the two seems complex to me, and discussion from the cloud-and-dice diagrams doesn't seem to represent that complexity.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415901/#Comment_415901" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T10:51:59+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 10:51AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are great points, John!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415912/#Comment_415912" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T12:49:10+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 12:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2013 12:49PM by DanMaruschak.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/12/22/rpg-theory-is-real-vs-fictional-the-most-important-distinction/" rel="nofollow">"fictional" vs. "real world"</a> is not necessarily a great way to think about the clouds/boxes distinction, but I do think the clouds/boxes thing at least raised some interesting questions and is talking about an interesting and important phenomenon in games. I just finished reading a psychology paper, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/" rel="nofollow">Construal-Level Theory of Psychological Distance</a>, which suggests the notion that certain "distance"-related factor in human cognition are related and tend to be linked with each other, such as abstractness vs. concreteness, social distance, physical distance, distance in time, etc. They say, for example, that "how" tends to be close while "why" tends to be far, and "lots of categories" tends to be close while "few categories" tends to be far, and providing examplars of a category (e.g. a type of soda is: cola) is closer than categorizing (e.g. soda is a type of: beverage). I see a lot of parallels in RPG stuff here: e.g. the way that explicit stakes-setting games (focus on "why") can sometimes result in seemingly losing track of the "present" of actually experiencing the scene (abstract knowledge of events instead of concrete experience of them), a larger skill list tends to feel more "grounded" than a broader breakdowns (e.g. mind/body/social), going from the list of AW GM moves to a particular fictional event tends to push you into in-the-moment thinking while things like "who knows me better?" tend to push you toward more a more abstract mindset where you might notice themes, etc. I haven't worked through all the implications yet, and there are other papers I want to read as followups, but I think there's some interesting and fruitful stuff here for game analysis and game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416091/#Comment_416091" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T09:57:46+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  9:57AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In old D&amp;D or any sort of OSR thing, that sort of interpretation from the GM is fine and expected, but in new D&amp;D it's cheating (even if it helps the players!).</blockquote>\nI don't follow you. I'm not sure who you're responding to, what "that sort of interpretation" refers to, and how you're defining cheating. I don't want to get in the way of the rest of the discussion, though, so it may not be necessary that I understand. Carry on.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nNo, it's on topic. If we're playing Pathfinder, and I narrate swinging my hammer really hard and hitting an antagonist on the arm, if the GM says, "Great, in addition to the damage, you disarm him!" that's cheating/fiating/Rule Zeroing. In 1E or whatever that's fine (IME).</blockquote>\nI think that's not to do with new and old D&amp;D (especially as D&amp;D 4e explicitely doesn't work the way you say new D&amp;D does).  It's to do with the purpose of the rules.  D&amp;D 3.X/Pathfinder, like GURPS, and a number of 1980s <a href="http://eudaimonaiaclaughter.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/tabletop-roleplaying-traveller-to-a-common-language/" rel="nofollow">toolbox games</a> are process sim games.  The purpose of the game rules is to establish the world in which to play, and as such the outcomes are pretty tightly detailed.  When a DM overrides the rules they are quite literally changing the laws of physics in the shared imaginary space.<br/><br/>And I thought one of the points of modern Euro-style boardgames* was to be abstract and to be almost a pure contest of skill.  The theme is neither more nor less than a framing story that makes it easier to start playing.  (In fact one of my tests for Eurogames is whether a "naive strategy" made entirely from fictional considerations leads to decent play.  If it doesn't I'm not interested, but these games seem to be outliers).  Of course when the purpose of the game is a contest of skill people stop worrying about the fiction.  This is a feature and not a bug.<br/><br/>* Older Eurogames were based on the German model of family games which were deep enough for adults, but simple enough for kids to play.  More modern Eurogames are pitched at adults (generally American) who want to play abstract games because there's more money there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416097/#Comment_416097" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T11:08:49+00:00" title="June 12, 2013 11:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Slightly off-topic, I'd love to hear about some good board games where a "naive strategy" is indeed effective!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18419/fiction-last-what-does-it-ruin-for-you/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18419%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18419%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
