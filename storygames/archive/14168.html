The reviewers really didn't want to look any deeper into it than the romance. However, if you flip the story and begin looking at it from the perspective of the Bureau, it becomes another story. They aren't Bad Guys. They don't want to be Bad Guys. However, they have been saddled with the responsibility to keep humankind progressing along The Plan. The Plan insures that humankind wont' destroy itself or end up in another Dark Age. So, when key players in the game start to go Off-Plan, its their job to make adjustments so that things don't spiral out of control. Forgot your car keys? The Bureau may have lost them for you so that you miss that car crash that would have killed you.<br/><br/>However, the Bureau has its limits. They aren't human. They have trouble with empathy or improvising. A lack of curiousity is also a problem in that almost all of them are quite willing to do their jobs without asking any questions. Allow an innocent man to die so things stay On Plan? No problem. Know why he had to die? As one of the agents said, "Its above my pay grade."<br/><br/>They aren't automotons, and they are overall doing a Good Work, but their thought processes are disturbingly "corporate."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321858/#Comment_321858" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T15:00:10+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  3:00PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2011 3:05PM by Andy.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite><i>The Adjustment Bureau</i>is a fairly standard romance drama in which the forces trying to keep the lovers apart are given a sci-fi/fantasy twist.

I wasn't like crushingly underwhelmed or anything, but was just kinda mildly underwhelmed. I was definitely entertained, and I liked the cast, though.<br/><br/>I'm gonna try doing the spoiler text thing. Not huge spoilery, but just in case someone didn't want to know. Highlight the following text block:<br/>=====<br/><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">The "agents" in the movie come clean pretty early on that they are in fact <b>Angels</b>, working for a <b>Judeo-christian God</b>. I don't mind theist elements in movies, but that element kinda made me think "Well that's kind of an easy cop-out". I was /so/ much more hoping for anything else: Humans, time travellers, a magical cult, heck even *aliens*. But saying "Angels" took a lot of cool possible motive speculation and "Unknown Armies-ness" of the setup and tosses it right out. Not horrible, just kind of a waste of potential story.</span><br/>=====<br/><br/>I have not seen Source Code, but it sounds cool.<br/><br/>Limitless I found to be Awesome. But I have a soft spot* for Bradley Cooper. Someone proposed it was the contemporary equivalent of Flowers for Algernon. I love FfA and stories in that vein, but this is not that. It's basically kind of a low power superhero movie of sorts, with more scenes of "awesome" than "moral ambiguity". But I was thoroughly entertained, and there were some pretty cool twists.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/>* that may or may not get hard                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321902/#Comment_321902" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T02:48:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  2:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Andy">@Andy</a>: I'd have to watch it again, but my memory of your spoiler is different.
