A storm strands them there.  Murder and mayhem ensue.<br/><br/>Cast: Sen. Ben Templeton - heroic politician; Dr. Emily Smith - murderous geneticist; Father Simon Rushim - zealous facility chaplain; Loretta Hamil - crazy medium; Beth Haughten - wealthy socialite; Gilroy X - facility commando.<br/><br/>I'd been looking for something to take to a local game shop's beer and pizza night, something that would be relatively easy to pick up and teach, and Geiger Counter looked like it might fit the bill.  A lot of the goplaypdx crew were either late or didn't make it but we roped in three people who hadn't played a game like it before and played an abbreviated session.  We knew up front that some folks would have to leave early and we were forced to rush some things so I can't say that every aspect of the game got a proper showing.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, though; they all planned to grab it off the website and one of them intends to facilitate it himself some time soon.<br/><br/>I'd recommended in another thread a bullet point teaching aid for people planning to moderate a game for their first time, but in practice I found it pretty easy to flip through the document and cover each of the important points.  I had Christian (xenopulse) who'd played it at GoPlayNW to help me along too.<br/><br/>We brainstormed eight goals for our setting and then chose six (one each) from among those and did the same for character concepts.  That seemed to work pretty well, although if I were taking this to a con or to a future game night, I would appreciate the opportunity to whittle down the time on this by having five style sheets that had ten goals and ten character concepts already prepared with players picking from among those or making up their own as desired.  I'll bet these kinds of movies can be collected into only a handful of boilerplates.   <br/><br/>All the new people really warmed to their roles as directors and did a great job.  It reminded me of PTA in terms of how quickly people fall into a mode of scene-framing in an RPG if the instructions for it are presented in terms of cinema.<br/><br/>Knowing we were pressed for time, we built up the Menace quickly (for the record: Fast, Strong, Hazardous Environment, Tentacles, Enemy Commandos, Relationship with Scientists, Impervious to Firearms, Flooding), and the pacing definitely suffered for that.  We didn't get enough opportunities to develop our characters, so the goal fulfillments felt a little rushed as well.<br/><br/>As a data point, we all died. I had emphasized the core of the game being to try to arrive at a point where most of us died but that one or two of us survived and I don't think we engaged much in those behaviors that reduced character survivability.  There was exactly one die-rolling confrontation between characters and we didn't have the Menace attack any main characters until it had five dice.  After it peaked at eight dice we immediately succeeded in fulfilling two goals to bring it down to 6 dice and then another in the following scene to bring it to five.  Still, it wiped us all out and probably could probably taken out a couple more of us given the chance.  We did have a "traitor" that sided with the Menace so that was part of it.  I wouldn't choose to restrict the number of Traitors but I could see some this getting pretty ugly if there were even two of them w/o some mitigating mechanical help for prospective survivors.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>- a great prelude with blinking monitoring stations and a lush underwater biosphere.<br/>- great camerawork all around with cool descriptions of the storm and water on the lenses.<br/>- the inadequately pinioned helicopter is blown off the helipad and crashes though the plateglass windows of the mess hall below, hanging from cables.<br/>- Father Simon and his "knife-in-a-hollowed-out-bible" ruse.<br/>- the na\xefve medium Loretta attempts to empathize with the aquatic menace with predictable results.<br/>- the scientist "mother" of the menace scolds her "child" to try to get it to behave.<br/>- moments after promising to leave his wife and make his mistress an honest woman, action-hero Ben inadvertantly torches both her and the menace with highly-oxygenated fire from the tanks in the medical facility.<br/><br/>Our abbreviated and rushed session makes me hesitate to make too many playtester observations, but I would try to answer any questions that come to mind.  I did have a good time with this game and hope I can play it again soon.  It gave me an opportunity to meet some neat new people and introduce them to a shared-authority gamestyle they weren't familiar with.  I own a lot of the IPR catalogue and there are only a few games I would feel so comfortable running for new people so quickly (PTA and Contenders among them).  And Geiger Counter was free!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164517/#Comment_164517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T18:47:56+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  6:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Geiger Counter is a perfect beer&amp;pizza game (even though I don't drink beer).  It's easy to pick up, it allows for all kinds of fun interactions, and it doesn't go too deep.<br/><br/>I think when I first played it at Go Play NW, I was looking for a deeper something, for lack of a better term. I didn't accept it for what it says that it is: a game where you basically create B-movies. Sci Fi channel stuff. It's awesome fun, but the characters won't be complex.  They don't have time to develop before they get eaten, usually.<br/><br/>So this time my expectations were different, and it was more satisfying for me.  I played Loretta, and while I initially tried to pick fights with Beth, in the end I was just happy playing a loon who tried to give the menace a hug to make it all better. That actually did come out of the way Alex played the scientist's interaction with the menace when I was directing--we fell into a mother-child relationship, and that was really cool.<br/><br/>Then I picked up Ben after Loretta died and got to fulfill Beth's goal and his goal (redemption) at the same time with a corny, B-movie-class confession of love and promises.  And then I accidentally fried her.  Oops! <br/><br/>It was good, easy fun, and definitely something I'd bring out for a casual game night at any time.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the generic GC thread: I'd flesh out more secondary characters next time, just with names and archetypes, and I don't see the need for a traitor condition.

Usually what happens when I run it is that, if the menace begins to quickly kill people off, their survival dice passing to the remaining characters helps give them a boost.  And, by teaming up against the menace and grabbing the 2-dice or 3-dice advantage pool, some of the boosted characters are eventually able to win or at least get the menace down to a couple dice and escape, though one or two more usually die near the end.  Was the menace just picking characters off one-by-one, with few opportunities to team up?  Or was it just rolling really well against the characters?<br/><br/>I'm glad you still found it enjoyable and worthwhile, though.  Sometimes an "everybody dies" ending can be appropriate, but it can be hard to shift into that mode when you're not expecting it.  <br/><br/>In early playtests (the first 6-8, actually), all I was getting was ScifFi channel movies too.  Certainly, trying to figure out what makes the difference in producing "good" survival horror rather than just fun, campy B-movies is one of my main goals for the beta.  I don't want to put out the final version until I can help people make good movies consistently.  But my more recent experiences match Ben's. If you take your time in developing and playing out the game, Geiger Counter can definitely give you Alien instead of Lake Placid, but, like I said, I'm not entirely sure of the exact processes there.  Because there are no mechanics for having deep character scenes, that doesn't mean that you can't have them, but, right now, there's no explicit support for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164592/#Comment_164592" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T10:56:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2008 10:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was mostly bad luck on die rolls.  There was one attack by the Menace on a character that was alone, but she had a mobile Advantage die and was in her lab where she had two static Advantage dice.  We were otherwise all together throughout.  We were in the area with three static Advantage dice when the 8-dice Menace attacked, but our traitor rolled with the Menace and she had a Survivor die and an extra Advantage die so the three of us remaining were looking at 12 dice.  Even with all those dice, the Menace only managed an 11, but we with all our dice only managed a 10, I think.  All the characters dying didn't lessen my enjoyment any, (nor others as far as I could tell).  Just wanted to report the data point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I don't see that there's anything in the mechanics that encourages fun campy B-movies preferentially over "good" survival horror or something more serious like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down.  You've got a nice core mechanic of steadily increasing and then diminishing opposition.  Everything else is going to be provided by the direction of the text and then the whims of the people playing.  Beer + Pizza + first time Geiger Counter players + people playing with each other for the first time is usually going to generate the kind of fun we had.<br/><br/>As long as it was kept simple I <i>might</i> like to see some kind of mechanic where you had to make some kind of roll to achieve your Goal satisfactorily (not something that would give you a condition if you failed), rather than just achieve it narratively.  Once you had that in place, you would have the option of adding a mechanic where a player got a bonus by working on their Goal in the first half of the movie as the Menace was building.  "Working on" might be defined as having a scene that foreshadowed/put their goals front and center.  The effect might be more character-driven scenes over characters running away and looking for guns or cattle-prods, etc.  <br/>Not sure there.  Just spit-balling.  <br/><br/>Maybe something as simple as providing an option where in some games you decide as a group that in THIS game the 3 mobile dice are defined as Survival dice that are associated with the characters Goals in some way, rather than being Advantage dice.<br/><br/>I don't know.  If you think about a "good" survival horror movie like Alien, it's more about direction, acting, camera work, pacing, and script than in-depth character moments that make it "good."  We don't really know or learn much about any of the characters in that movie, not even Ripley; it's just that the dialogue and special effects aren't cheesy.<br/><br/>Some time when we know we have a four hour window and mostly players who have played before, I'd be curious to come up with a style sheet for something like Saving Private Ryan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164615/#Comment_164615" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T13:51:28+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  1:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... you know how some games reward inter-character fights?  That's the opposite of Geiger Counter.  I started up a little fight between Loretta (my crazy medium who was the senator's assistant) and Beth (who was the socialite on the campaign and whom I, through directorial instructions, determined to have an affair with the senator).  I wanted to get some tension going.  But we ended up rolling dice and coming up with a tie.  So we both took a condition from that--one of three on our way to death.<br/><br/>That pretty much discouraged me from intra-group conflict.<br/><br/>Now, I know there are great survival movies where the characters don't necessarily have conflicts with each other.  But I like to hold up Pitch Black as my favorite B-movie.  And I couldn't play it with GC, because those early fights between Johns and Riddick would lead to both of them having one or two conditions already by the time the menace comes around.  In other words, what's used in the movie to show badassery would lead to the opposite in the game.<br/><br/>And that's perfectly fine!  Because GC doesn't have to emulate all survival horror movies.  But as I said, you just have to get the expectations right.<br/><br/>I do agree that the dice rolled against us.  The menace didn't actually have 8 dice in that final confrontation, it had 5.  It had lost two from Ben promising to give up politics to be with Beth (True Love for Beth, Redemption for Ben) and one from Loretta getting killed (Murderous Intent of Emily).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164619/#Comment_164619" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T14:24:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  2:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 2:24PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.  <i>If</i> you wanted that to work differently there'd some mechanical benefit to bumping heads via Confrontation early.  The only benefit I could see would be if the group decided that the PCs were fighting over an Advantage die, and even then the advantage is just to the winner.  Maybe Conditions gained in PC vs PC Confrontations shouldn't count against their 3-strikes you're out?  That would remove at least some of the disincentive from player Confrontations.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I love FATE so much is the implicit "dials" on it that you can tune according to what you're using it for.  Maybe there could be a default mode for GC, and then some optional rules in the back along with what kind of sub-genres of horror movies they help create.  'Course then you've got to test those options for performance...<br/><br/>I know the Menace had 5 dice in the final Confrontation in the command center, but I thought it had 8 the scene before in the medical facility where the 3 static Advantage dice were?

So, for Pitch Black, several of those early confrontations wouldn't be diced at all. They're just character-revealing scenes of posturing and intimidation. Johns probably does get a condition in there somewhere, though, given how things work out in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164828/#Comment_164828" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T17:51:59+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  5:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I can do all kinds of things without going to dice, in any game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But I can't advocate for my character effectively if we've got a chase scene with me and the bounty hunter, if we're just supposed to agree on how that turns out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164918/#Comment_164918" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T08:46:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [I'm taking more discussion of the new rules to the general <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7348" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter Beta</a> thread, so as not to clutter up your actual play too much]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164979/#Comment_164979" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T12:42:08+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>If you think about a "good" survival horror movie like Alien, it's more about direction, acting, camera work, pacing, and script than in-depth character moments that make it "good."

I think what makes a "good" movie is likely to be non-mechanical, so I want to give really good suggestions on how to create one, but I don't think I'll be able to really make it part of the rules.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Maybe Conditions gained in PC vs PC Confrontations shouldn't count against their 3-strikes you're out?</blockquote>\nHmm, the only problem there is not being able to have main characters be responsible for each other's deaths and that's, like, half the fun <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>I can't advocate for my character effectively</blockquote>\nChristian, this comment really stuck out at me and something that might be potentially problematic for Geiger Counter.  Personally, I find it really hard to both be an advocate for my character's goals in the fiction and also ultimately do what's best for the entire game, including throwing my own character under a bus.  That's why I added the "Push the Red Button" section at the end that attempts to explicitly say: "You're not your character's advocate.  You are more like the actor responsible for playing them in the movie.  You're trying to give the best performance you can possibly give for that character, but you're not trying to change what's 'supposed' to happen to your character, to make them succeed or survive."<br/><br/>Honestly, in a game of Geiger, I can totally see Johns and Riddick's players sitting next to each other and constantly giving each other shit, without having there be a real confrontation, because they both are sharing in the process of creating this rivalry and agree on how things are going to work out.  Once they stop agreeing or think one of them should really be at a disadvantage or suffer, then they start calling for Confrontations, rolling dice, and giving each other Conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
