We rationalize after the fact, and attribute our excitement to whatever seems reasonable. If you give someone a stimulant before introducing them to new people, they'll attribute their heightened heart rate and bodily agitation to social nervousness. And Ovid, in his Ars Amatoria (IIRC), points out that to seduce a young woman, you should take her for exciting rides; she'll attribute her heart's flutters to being around you. <br/><br/>Over to rolling dice while role-playing. The excitement of seeing whether or not the dice go your way - the simple thrill of gambling - is used in many, many games. What role-playing does, in some cases, is to borrow or transfer that excitement to what's going on in the fiction. If there's a dramatic situation in the game, that drama is heightened, for many, by the unpredictability of dice.<br/><br/>In a sense, we're seducing ourselves into enjoying the fiction. Heightening tension by using dice. No wonder that drinks high on caffeine and sugar are mandatory for gaming nights. The game feels even more exciting after a gallon of coke or Mountain Dew. <br/><br/>Thinking about <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/archipelago/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> (which I do all the time these days), I'm struck by how that game uses social mechanics to induce excitement and unpredictability. The common denominator for many of the mechanics - drawing the map together, making someone else draw a card, creating destiny points for others - is the excitement of seeing what the other players will come up with, <i>that you're going to have to incorporate</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168595/#Comment_168595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T01:08:15+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  1:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find dice rolling more annoying than exciting, let's get on with it and get to the real roleplaying, the social interaction. I'm far happier with unpredictability that comes from not knowing what other people will do rather some random thing*. It's Complicated, for example has no randomizer but is certainly exciting and Polaris doesn't use dice for the most part but is one of the most exciting games I've played.<br/><br/>Also we drink tea during our gaming, which is a pretty mild high. You need to keep your whistle wet but I don't think it's going to give you a buzz. But I certainly do get buzzy after a good game, it usually takes me a couple of hours to calm down afterwards and it's similar to the buzz I get from playing football.<br/><br/>I think part of it, for me, is about discovering new things, no so much about how I'm going to incorporate them.<br/><br/>I guess I should try Archipelago because it sounds as if it's doing things I like.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*If you use randomness to direct the flow of games, you're always post-hoc justifying what has happened. I'm not sure why that's a problem for me, perhaps because it breaks the flow of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168598/#Comment_168598" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T01:55:54+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  1:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2008 1:56AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Also we drink tea during our gaming, which is a pretty mild high.</blockquote>\n(According to <a href="http://wilstar.com/caffeine.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> site, a cup of ("brewed, imported") tea has the same amount of caffeine as one bottle of Mountain Dew - approx 1/2 cup of coffee.

Randomness can create agitiation, but so can the spastic social interactions, a timer, or other means. The dice don't matter its the agitiation, so the indie people who are like, dice don't do it for me thrive on the interpersonal agitation from social groups. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean if you take this attribution theory seriously, that all their is social contract, and all the other stuff in the big model simply the attempt at rationalizing the attributition of the agitation that comes from the unknown of social interactions? <br/>\n<br/>\nJust thinking if this puts the story way off and away or really close.

Do x and if the gm likes you, you succeed, is fun because on some certain level you are not sure if the gm likes you and this creates the agitation that is attributed to the game as excitement and reward. <br/>\n<br/>\nalso interesting thought on the timer, as an explanation of why hot potatoe is fun, althought the passing of a potato may serve as a random generator of a kind (Possibility over time = random?)<br/>\njust a thought                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
