Do you want to do something besides wait in line for videogame demos? This post is for you!<br/><br/><b>So you want to run a game?</b><br/>Awesome! Please do! If you're looking for more players, you can use the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ttlfg&amp;Mode=like">#ttlfg</a> (tabletop - looking for group) tag on twitter. There's also the <a href="/forums/profile/pax_indie_rpgs">@pax_indie_rpgs</a> twitter account, which has a bunch of followers just waiting to get in on games. You can post messages to that account by talking to me or tweeting at me (<a href="/forums/profile/olde_fortran">@olde_fortran</a> on twitter). If you ask nice I'll just give you access to the <a href="/forums/profile/pax_indie_games">@pax_indie_games</a> account so you can promote your games yourself.<br/><br/><b>Where?</b><br/>This is where it gets interesting. We don't <em>officially</em> have a room, so we're trying to make <b>room 304</b> the unofficial official indie games room. 304 is a freeplay room, so the only way we can make it 'ours' (and give people a central place to find indie games) is to have games going in there. We can do that, right?<br/><br/>Room 304 should be just off the escalators as you some in from Pike street. I'll be there 10 am (when the con opens) every day to try to establish some indie presence. The more people the better.<br/><br/><b>So you want to play a game?</b><br/>That's just as awesome as running one! The only way we can make room 304 'ours' is by having games happening in it pretty consistently, so your warm body filling a spot at a table is just as awesome. If you're between games, just taking up space in 304 is still kind of useful, until there's a game that wants to happen there.<br/><br/><b>What can I do to help?</b><br/>So glad you asked. The best thing you can do is <em>come and play games in room 304</em>. Really. That easy. If you really want to promote, we'll have some flyers to hand out with information, or you can just tell people about it. In particular it'd be cool to have someone outside some of the RPG panels handing out flyers, particularly the GeekNights guys panel, they did a lot of promoting of indie games last year.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291561/#Comment_291561" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-04T11:55:06+00:00" title="September  4, 2010 11:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not there, and jealous of all you bastards who are having all the fun.

Other folks were playing Fiasco and preparing for Dresden Files. Wandered through the exhibition hall where I was unexpectedly impressed by the new Mortal Kombat game (evocative, back to roots, beautiful, brutal) and drooled along with everyone else to Portal 2. Stumbled upon Lesley, who was working the show in a support role for a number of booths in the same general region (including Chessex).  She showed me where the secret Hidden Level is where a lot of the tabletop stuff happens (part  of the Dreaming's booth, some open play tables).  It was cool but a bit disappointing, which is true of most things tabletop-related at the show.  Even WOTC's booth was mostly about playing Magic online, despite the fact that the Castle Ravenloft boardgame just dropped and the new Red Box is coming out next week.  Went back to 304 and ran Apocalypse World for a bunch of folks who hadn't played it.  It rocked.  Then got amazing-but-pricey drinks at Vessel with some folks, including Ryan Macklin From The Internet and Chris Hanrahan of Endgame in Oakland (the store that sells more indie games than any store in the country).  Got home after midnight.  Skipping Saturday but will be back Sunday with my brother.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291566/#Comment_291566" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-04T12:34:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2010 12:34PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So glad you guys are rocking PAX out.

I feel really accomplished, since I think a lot of people found a lot of new games they liked over the course of the weekend. I personally ran 8 or 9 Fiasco games, and was amazed to see a Fiasco game self-start with some first time players. They just grabbed the book and figured it out.<br/><br/>Fiasco, Fiasco, more Fiasco, plus Burning Wheel and Dungeon World. Lots and lots of new gamers. Total win.

I felt warm and fuzzy that the answer was of course, nope, that's the full sheet!"<br/><br/>I think the XP thing just stemmed from some stat-marking peculiarities; my Thief struggled with Wis and Cha marked, especially since we went down the corridor with nobody to Parlay with. WHen we all compared, all the other players were at about the same XP marks. If I'd had Dex marked I'd have kept pace just fine.<br/><br/>Not that it matters; The Fox is nothing but a pile of ashes and singed domino mask on the floor of the Purple Worm Graveyard at this point! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291786/#Comment_291786" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T12:06:21+00:00" title="September  6, 2010 12:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't play in any 304 games -- cons like PAX turn into scouting &amp; networking events for me.

I got to play Dungeon World in the fabled 304, and did more playing outside the room, too. But having that place as a gathering spot, information distribution venue, and conversational hub proved invaluable, especially with all the text messages going missing during the show. So, thank you, Sage.<br/><br/>Like Ryan, this was a fact-finding mission for me.

Gabe also walked through 304, but seemed to just be seeing what was going on, and he left before I got a chance to try to talk to him. They've also been handed several indie games by several different people over the years, and occasionally mention them on their respective sites. Wil is all about Fiasco right now, Tycho mentioned Burning Wheel a few weeks back, and Gabe has some interest in Wildlings. I just saw a photo of Tycho/Jerry with Blowback on twitter.<br/><br/>I'm putting together some thoughts on PAX 2011 for my blog, which I'll also post here for discussion. I figure I'll give everyone a few weeks cooldown, then start trying to find the right people to talk to about 2011.

It's mostly enthusiastic gamers looking for new and hot. There are three people on my team at work (two of them RPGers waaaaaay back in the day, would probably be receptive to trying again) who were planning a trip to PAX East: Affluent, 30s-40s hipsters just looking to see what's up, with money to spend and eyes on cool things to do. Conversely with GenCon, it seems that most people are "locked in" for exactly what they're going to do for those four days of gaming long before they book tickets to the event, and seldom venture outside those circles.<br/><br/>There might be a burn effect later: Once something is hot for a time, it will quickly disappear from the public mind (lots of indie PC games had this happen; Sins of a Solar Empire, etc). So don't think that a mention on a blog == infinite sales and press. Still, it's an interesting scene.<br/><br/>Also, I find it totally weird that no one here posts on the <b>Penny Arcade tabletop gaming forum</b>. I mostly lurk there, posting when there is an upcoming gaming or anime con (for meetups/face to face gaming, etc) but there are a LOT of folks on that forum, lots of interesting actual-play style discussion (a lot of it D&amp;D 4e). Might be a good time to see if you can reconnect with some of those Fiasco players, if they frequent that forum, and see how they are enjoying their game after the con.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291894/#Comment_291894" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T05:53:53+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  5:53AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I lurk on the wargames forums over there, but never thought to post on the rpg bit!

It isn't out job to get nerdfamous people to mention our tribe's wares. That way lies a dangerous road, where we're too pushy. They're already mentioning our stuff -- for people like Paul or Jason, they've already won with the amount of buzz given to their games.<br/><br/>If our task is to promote, then our job is to be awesome. Very, very loudly awesome. If we are, people will take note. It might take longer that some folks are cool with, but slowly, day by day, more people will take note.
