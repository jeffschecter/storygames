Assign the following roles: Cardinal Walter Kasper, Pope Benedict XVI, Father Christopher Jamison and Andrew Copson. Pick a country that the Pope is visiting for this game.<br/><br/>Play begins with Cardinal Kasper making a statement. The Cardinal must make a vicious and unpleasant speech about the country being visited. He should make it as insulting as he can without actually telling any falsehoods. The Cardinal then leaves the room.<br/><br/>In the second scene, Pope Benedict XVI makes a speech. The Pope must make a speech that tops the Cardinal's speech for insult and petulance, and his speech can include blatant falsehoods.<br/><br/>The third scene consists of Father Christopher Jamison attempting to rehabilitate the Pope's comments, layering an interpretation on them that makes them less insulting. However, he cannot directly contradict anything the Pope said. At some point during this scene, Andrew Copson holds up a piece of paper with the words 'technical difficulties' written on it which interrupts the speech. Seeing this, Jamison says "I think I'm losing touch..." then Andrew Copson nods his head slowly.<br/><br/>The game is now over.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_293731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293731/#Comment_293731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T06:19:15+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  6:19AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 6:19AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a game, this is less interesting, but as a political game-text, it is. <br/><br/>I would say that the insulting bits don't quite convince me, as a reflection of the cardinal or the pope, but then I do not follow these figures closely, so I can't really tell. It may be that the game (text) would be better if there was some background for the characters in play, referring to their behavior in the real world. Thus the players of the game may be strengthened in their interpretation of the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293733/#Comment_293733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T06:46:40+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  6:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pope player's priority should be plausible-sounding falsehoods rather than insulting.

Trying to keep the lies plausible is a nice addition, although again not in the source material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
