In some ways, <i>Vampire</i> is the Anne Rice RPG, and her writings suffer from exactly the same problem. <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> is supposedly a cautionary tale, but, honestly, it's about how cool Lestat is, and the rest of the series homes in on him, not on Louis.<br/><br/>Caveat: I'm not an Anne Rice fan. This aspect of her writing quickly turned me off, and I haven't gone back.

Sure, I knew the guy whose character wore a trenchcoat, carried a katana, and drove a ferrari, which nobody else could ride in because the passenger seat was reserved for his guitar...<br/><br/>BUT I also remember playing Vampire with super-shitty characters. We had way less dots - I don't remember exactly how characters go anymore, but we had 1 dot in one discipline, like 4/2/0 for attributes, or even less, no freebie points, etc. and we were much worse than normal humans. And we went on a bumbling adventure fraught with failure, because we were pathetic loser vampires, which is kinda what the game setting makes you be anyway. It was pretty cool.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I just don't think most players use these pieces of the game.</blockquote>\nAND I also remember that when I used to run Sabbat games, nobody cared about the morality systems. They flipped through the Paths of Enlightenment and picked the one with the sins they were least interested in. I seem to remember people responding better to Humanity, even. So yeah - pieces not used. I think the game was pretty broken, too, like many others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142055/#Comment_142055" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T13:41:28+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  1:41PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly when I played Vampire, I played a tortured moral character who longed for his humanity... and the game was an awful bore for everyone, because that never came up in play.

And really, the supplements didn't do much to expand on this style of play, then they did the Paths of What I Was Going To Do Anyway and completely sunk it.<br/><br/>In practice, Vampire was a highly flexible game that I could use to do all kinds of different things, and that was okay with me. I even did the broody humanity-tortured thing with a small group once, and it worked fine. But you had to be conscious about it. In fact, to a degree, Vampire was the first conscious "campaign design" I ever did, because it was painfully clear that if I didn't, I would get a high society Toreador and a gutter-crawling Malkavian and I wouldn't have a campaign, just four different ones for four different players, and no way to railroad any of them anywhere!<br/><br/>Edit: I should elucidate on this in a different thread, Vampire is such a truly awesome game in so many very different ways, the margin of this thread cannot possibly contain them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
