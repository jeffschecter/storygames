For example, I might get a card with a picture of a moon on it and say that one culture "believes that the moon will bring death," and I'll write that down somewhere and draw a picture of a moon. Then you might get a card with an eye on it, say that they guys are "envious," and we'll put that down and draw the eye on there too.<br/><br/>That's just the start of it. After we've invented the two cultures, we get to roleplay! Through play, we create characters from the cultures we've invented, and, by roleplaying those characters, we explore the decimation of one of those cultures in an ancient war. There's a lot of tragedy, fighting, betrayal, love and hatred.<br/><br/>It's for 3-5 players, takes 3 hours to play, and fits in your pocket.<br/><br/><a href="http://igg.me/p/38864?a=226599&amp;i=shlk" rel="nofollow">Chronicles of Skin</a><br/><br/><b>NEW UPDATE:</b> If we can get $5,000, we can double the quality for a third of the price, set it up for international distribution and get it to shops before Christmas.

It's a hard question to answer, metrically.<br/><br/>The game opens with a throw down of cards, each bearing a symbol. Players interpret these symbols and invent traits for an "ancient culture." At the same time, these symbols are added to a flag (actually drawn onto the playsheet). The process is heavily structured, with each player taking a turn to use a symbol and invent a trait. Play, at this stage, is dictated by the rules but directed and influenced by the cards.<br/><br/>The rest of the game is played out in scenes. One player introduces a scene and foreshadows a tragedy, everyone introduces their character according to their character card, and play begins proper. Here we see the use of the Puppet and Event features, which steer the scene toward specific themes. The early part of the scene structure is dictated by the rules, influenced by the cards/doodles of the players, but <i>directed </i>by a single player. After the characters are introduced, the braces slacken and we see play partially influenced by the cards, and much more of the "play box" situation, where players are free to craft a story. Now cards become tools that players can use to shape the story toward their chosen theme.<br/><br/>Finally, in the end game, the cards are taken out of play. So, as the game flows from beginning to end, you might see this pattern:<br/><br/>First phase, flags: Structure &gt; Cards &gt; Play Box<br/>Second phase, scene intro: Structure &gt; Cards &gt; Play Box<br/>Third phase, scene proper: Play Box &gt; Cards &gt; Structure<br/>Fourth phase, end game: Structure &gt; Play Box &gt; Cards                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341330/#Comment_341330" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T23:53:09+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 11:53PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341335/#Comment_341335" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-02T01:12:17+00:00" title="September  2, 2011  1:12AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you do in the game?

A war has begun and, through four scenes, you expose the cause of that war, explore the differences in the two cultures, and drive the scenes toward a specific, predefined theme (according to cards dealt during setup). The game encourages the use of drawing as a tool to record and provoke play.<br/><br/>There will be a four page proof of the rules coming shortly, so maybe it's best that I leave the rest of the explanation there.

Only the rules will be released online.<br/><br/>Until then, if you have questions about the game, I'll do my best to answer them here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342881/#Comment_342881" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T20:32:48+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  8:32PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would seem like the story of two warring civilisations would work perfectly for two players.

Can the game be easily adapted for just 2 players? What about solo play?</blockquote>\nWhile the game is about two warring cultures, the stories are most often about people from the same culture, not opposing cultures. It could be adapted, but it was designed a s a collaborative experience, not a competitive one. I hadn't considered solo play at all, and I'd love to see someone hack it!\n<blockquote>Do Aspects, Beliefs and the other entries for a civilisation have mechanical effect? Is there room for them to be subverted?</blockquote>\nThey have a guiding effect, as tools for inspiration, during the narrative gameplay, and a specific effect, as modes of loss or victory (for the culture, not the player) during the epilogue. They can be, and should be, subverted, as characters from a culture stand against the idiosyncrasies that define their own people. That is what creates the richest experience in the game, as you begin to discover your own cultures turned upsidedown within the constraints that you collectively applied to them.\n<blockquote>How much of the game occurs on the macro level (battles, diplomacy) and how much on the micro level (characters, intrigue)?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you mean by this question. Could you give me an example of what you understand to be a game that uses macro levels (with an example situation)? Could do the same with micro levels too?\n<blockquote>It seems that by default the names of the two cultures - Croen and Iho - are fixed. Could you perhaps shine some light on why you made that design decision rather than having players pick culture names each time?</blockquote>\nMany of the components of the game are intentionally fixed, so that players are free to apply their creativity to the more important game elements. For example, all the character names are fixed, as are the inspirational symbols on the cards. This is not intended to limit the players, but instead to offer tangible constraints around which they can steer their imagination.\n<blockquote>Will it use a regular deck of playing cards, or is the presence of diamonds, spades, etc. on some of the materials a holdover from earlier versions of the game?</blockquote>\nIt will not use a regular deck of cards. Previous versions that used a deck of regular cards were great, but they lacked intuition. You were looking at this rulebook, looking at the card, looking at the rulebook. It was confusing and silly. Bright, shiny cards are the future.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of any legacy icons on the new cards. Am I missing something?\n<blockquote>Would it be easy to create additional play materials? It seems as if the cards are simply two symbols, making it quite easy for players to design new cards.</blockquote>\nThere are four symbols on each card, if you include the reverse, and yes, it would be really great if people designed their own decks. We have been talking about releasing a cyber-deck, with near-future faction wars and digital glyphs. And a cartoon deck, for younger players. But that's all pipe-dreaming at the moment!\n<blockquote>That's a barrage of questions! Feel free to only answer one or two if you've not got much time. </blockquote>\nI'm really happy that you're interested in the game. I don't know if I've done justice to your questions, so if you feel I missed the mark, please let me know and I'll do my best to clear it up better next time.<br/><br/>Sebastian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343085/#Comment_343085" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T19:13:37+00:00" title="September 16, 2011  7:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Simon, those answers cast a lot of light on the game.\n<blockquote><blockquote>How much of the game occurs on the macro level (battles, diplomacy) and how much on the micro level (characters, intrigue)?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you mean by this question.

So as friends we're telling a story of two warring cultures. For the first scene, Lu describes the confrontation between a templar of the Church of Croen and a radical street preacher named Iho. The templar is about to arrest the preacher, but they debate philosophy, and the templar realises Croen is a false god. That's what I'd call the micro level.<br/><br/>For the second scene, the Sons of Iho are locked in their mountain fastness. Their raiders creep through the woods to ambush a templar squad. Croen catapults are wheeled around to face the fastness' gate - and they begin to launch stone heads carved with the likeness of Invincible Croen. The gate falls, the raiders are discovered and put to the sword, and all adult male Sons of Iho are killed. But the True Faith still burns in the hearts of the women, as they are taken as slaves by the Croen victors. That's the macro level, as I see it.\n<blockquote>I'm not aware of any legacy icons on the new cards.

Yes, there seems to be an old Skin in there from the playing card days. Oops!\n<blockquote>Sure. So as friends we're telling a story of two warring cultures.

Chronicles of Skin presents scenes at a macro level: "At the Mountains of Chikugo, we see the marching armies. High atop the cliff, the generals of the Croen meet to discuss the fate of the great city." But immediately after, it zooms in on the micro, and that is where the action happens: "The general stands up, walks to the king and spits on his feet." However, the mechanics, allow you to zoom in and out between these levels very quickly.<br/><br/>For example, when using a Puppet Action in the game, you are controlling the actions of another player's character. That's a very micro approach. You can also use an Event Action in the game to describe the world, or its inhabitants (a macro approach): After the general spits on the king's feet, a player could play an Event Action, describing how the entire army is ambushed by the troops of the enemy. That's macro. But because of the mechanism of the Event Action, the game must return to a micro state very quickly.<br/><br/>In short, then, the game bounces between micro and macro, though most of the action occurs at a micro level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344204/#Comment_344204" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T02:30:47+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  2:30AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5 days to go.<br/><br/>We hit the $5,000 mark, so we're going into bulk production.
