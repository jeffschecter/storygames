I'm looking to create an exchange of bigger and better ideas, almost like a boasting contest, but more structured.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find the game text does do that, <i>what part of the text made that clear to you?</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find it doesn't, <i>what's missing?</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance to anyone who has the time to look at this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367935/#Comment_367935" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T14:49:17+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  2:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            man, I am just browsing through it and it's brilliant!<br><br>I think diagrams and sheets would help making it clearer though.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367940/#Comment_367940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T15:06:20+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  3:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've roughed up the character and thread sheets, which are basically pieces of paper with 12 resource boxes and 2 reserve boxes. I've realised the text doesn't specifically mention this, so I'll have to add a clarification, but to save you having to go back and check tomorrow: the first two resources on each sheet have 3 uses each, the next 4 have 2 uses each and the last 6 have 1 each. Reserves always have only 1 use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe I have to explain how reserves are used, lost and recovered in a bit more detail and there needs to be some general guidance on playing: like, I've realised tonight that it's almost impossible to prevent another character from finding out whatever their player wants them to know. It's easy to start any scene with something like "My spy sends me a note explaining all about the secret plan, which he overheard being discussed." I think that's a good thing though so I need to write something encouraging players to embrace it! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
