I've never played it, but what I've seen of many of the moves and the general design approach really appeals to me. <br/><br/>Here's a brief a critique I found online:<br/><br/><a href="http://gameofthebeast.blogspot.ca/2014/04/sagas-of-icelanders-critique.html" rel="nofollow">gameofthebeast.blogspot.ca/2014/04/sagas-of-icelanders-critique.html</a><br/><br/>I'm curious if these are valid critiques, and, whether yes or no, how you feel about them.<br/><br/>Any other thoughts on the game - brilliant points and points of difficulty! - are very welcome, as well.

The stuff about the Man I totally agree with, and can be solved by removing that playbook, which I routinely do. Everything else, not so much. There's an entire legal supplement (which I wrote!) for law stuff in the book, and I generally disagree with his take on the sagas as being superheroic narratives. <br/><br/>The game is not without problems but other than the Man being a little off, I don't think he's enumerating them. I'd point to the difficulty of some of the social moves that work differently or not at all against NPCs and the friction that can develop around the gender-transgressing Skjaldmey as areas worth more concern, personally.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456211/#Comment_456211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T15:21:51+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  3:21PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense to me, Jason!

Jason, I don't think "larger than life" necessarily leads you to "superhuman"; I think it means "just slightly elevated beyond normal human" and under that definition, I agree that the Sagas present larger-than-life characters. And I second the notion that the Sagas don't tend to worry much about the resources of the characters involved, save when they are important (like losing a lawsuit). The Sagas occupy a weird narrative space: quasi-historical (we have confirming evidence for quite a few of the incidents in them) but at the same time often burnishing or darkening the memories of those involved.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of the way fronts are presented in the SotI book; they aim at atmospheric but I always found them a bit confusing. That's possibly just me, or, well, just me and the guy who wrote the review <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In my experience, Sagas requires a certain amount of buy-in by everyone--that this is a game that is very harsh, that sometimes death will find you not through anything you did yourself--that tends to be easy for people who GM (or design brilliant games!) a lot but is less easy for more casual players to pick up right away; I started a thread a while ago to talk about that but it never went anywhere. What I'm getting at is that while pretty much any game is improved by having an airing out of expectations at the start, some need it more than others or you risk some player discontent. In this category I'd include SotI, Night Witches, and The Warren: games where Bad Stuff can just <i>happen</i>.<br/><br/>As for the Man and visiting Norway (or America) I <i>cough</i> wrote some solutions to both (and Jason was so very kind as to create a layout for my revised Man playbook, because he is a person whose Honor is never in doubt.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456215/#Comment_456215" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T16:37:13+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  4:37PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2016 4:39PM by vini_lessa.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having played the game a handful times, I find some of the critiques valid. Others not...<br/><br/>- The Man playbook really could be a bit less about counting beans and more about leading the family or making, you know, manly things (though he is actually pretty good at "making manly things" cause of it's high Gendered stat; I just think a few exclusive moves in this direction would help ).<br/><br/>- The Larger than life characters I don't agree with. Some sagas indeed have larger than life characters, others do not. Others have Larger than life side by side with "nose to the mud" ones. I don't have the time now to point which ones specifically, but I remember reading one full saga (Njall) and two partially, and this discrepancy was clear to me.<br/><br/>-  The passage of time is erratic, yeah. In our tables we estbalished the Man and Woman "counting beans" moves were made on a <i>Season</i> basis (instead of per Sessions). This soved the problem for us.<br/><br/>- Fronts were really confusing. I agree.<br/><br/>- Lack of recurring actions in Sagas: verses, Althing, travelling to the norway for politics. I don't agree with this. There is a whole chapter on politics and the Althing. Travelling to Norway is easily made by custom moves.<br/><br/><br/>I think SotI is a kind of a rough diamond. As <b>Aviatrix</b> describes above, it needs a bit more investment (and some tinkering ?) than other PbtA games. It would certainly benefit from a revised 2nd edition. Nothing of this avoided it being our favourite PbtA hack, though.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456217/#Comment_456217" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T16:44:18+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  4:44PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2016 4:48PM by vini_lessa.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, perhaps my comment above painted the game in some negative light.

Another characteristic of the narrative is the presence of omens and prophetic dreams. It is disputed whether this reflects a fatalistic outlook on the part of the author.</i><br/><br/>...in spades.

I probably have a lot in common with her :-)<br/><br/>Jeff, if folks have played Fiasco I think mentioning that there's something of a similar feel to SotI: not so much in the blackly comic "bad ideas gone worse way" of Fiasco, but a similar "this game works better when we drive towards conflict and things going suddenly, tragically wrong." At least this seems to be the default style that Jason &amp; others get a lot of juice from; certainly it was what happened when I had the good fortune to play with him at Dreamation. Definitely it's important to talk about character immunity or lack thereof, and maybe show just how, well to put it bluntly, fucked you can get when deadly weapons come out. Or in short, sometimes really bad things will snowball quite quickly out of things that seemed to be going just fine (similar things happen in Night Witches, when an extra Tempt Fate roll on a mission might result in lots of dead pilots.)<br/><br/>I'm hoping to maybe start a SotI game at my Tuesday night meetup (it might be a hard sell, given the fallout from the last time I ran it was not pleasant) and if I do I'll get, I hope, more chances to sort out the Man playbook.<br/><br/>Paul, yeah, that was the central insight: that it's not the Hardholder that you should look to for the Man, but the Operator, the guy caught up in a mess of obligations that can make you rich or bankrupt, maybe all at the same Thing. The choices were designed to bring lots of Icelandic flavor in (including Fostering, which was a Big Deal in Norse culture) while at the same time simplifying bookkeeping by putting everything in terms of silver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457707/#Comment_457707" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-31T04:14:36+00:00" title="October 31, 2016  4:14AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/aviatrix">@aviatrix</a><br/>Awesome, thanks for the thorough response; it helps a lot <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm excited to get into SotI; I think all the info everyone has provided about how to approach the Man archetype will help a lot.
