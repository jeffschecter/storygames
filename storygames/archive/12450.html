Well, I'm heading out in the morning, and I'll be at the Convention with or without any plan for how to go to sleep there.  But if someone were to reply here, it would surely set my mind at ease, as well as reduce your expenses.  I'm a very considerate roomie, honest.  I come in, curl up in a corner, and I'm long gone by the time normal convention-goers wake up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
