It was really nice to be able to hand out some Artha (including a motherfucking Deeds point!!), get a few Beliefs rewritten, etc., and then still do a few more scenes. We didn't do the full Artha handout process a second time later--we did individual Beliefs but not group awards--but still, it worked nicely, and it's something I've done a few other times, and not just with Burning Games:<br/><br/>Vincent Baker did it at Burning Con with Apocalypse World in a game I was in, having I think two different times when we stopped and did Hx. Imitating him, I did it once in my Dungeon World game at Dreamation two weeks back at the midpoint, with great results.<br/><br/>I think the reason I like it is because, in many story games, the end of session stuff isn't just handing out XP, but rather a chance to reflect on what has happened so far, what you've learned, and so on.<br/><br/>Have others done anything similar? How did it work or not?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460914/#Comment_460914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T08:45:19+00:00" title="March  5, 2017  8:45AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Sami and Eero's <i>Fables of Camelot</i> this way, but then it was always an "open table" kind of thing at conventions: I ran multiple short sessions in a row, but <i>players</i> didn't necessarily stay the same - an evolving map of the realm was updated at the end of each session to tie them all together.<br/><br/>Sometimes, playing Archipelago at home, we've actually done the end of session/beginning of new session stuff in the middle: Destiny Points where reached, so we wrote new ones, and those carried over to the following play encounter.<br/><br/>I have a game I'm designing where I would really like a session to last just 2-3 hours, so that two can typically be played in a row... but that's hard for me to achieve. My current <i>Everway</i> home game is largely based on a modification of my blueprint for that game, but the session we're having are 5 hours long on average. This probably means I have to drop that particular expectation (games I design always end up taking longer than I originally intended... but then, most games I play last longer than it says in the rules as well: I guess it's a matter of local playstyle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460927/#Comment_460927" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T20:44:11+00:00" title="March  5, 2017  8:44PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this makes a lot of sense, and I've always wanted to do it, but never had the opportunity. Most of my gaming is in timeslots shorter than 4 hours, anyway, and, like Rafu, I think I tend to play through things slower than many others - I like to dig into things a bit more and let them breathe.<br/><br/>Are there any tips or tricks for accomplishing this?<br/><br/>I'd imagine actually scheduling a formal deadline/break would help, for instance. Then you all have a target to aim for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460957/#Comment_460957" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T06:39:13+00:00" title="March  7, 2017  6:39AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2017 6:39AM by Deliverator.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run with only two players, both of whom are also GMs. :-)<br/><br/>Fables of Camelot seems like it'd be great for this sort of thing.
