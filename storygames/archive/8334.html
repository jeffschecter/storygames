The first games we've played have been good fun, we've all played our XCOM and WH40K and watched our Aliens and Starhip Troopers flicks, so we're pretty familiar with the genre. Thus the games have been pretty much about hosing down aliens, dropping macho one-liners and going on heroic killing sprees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is pretty much good clean fun. You know, a galaxy-wide genocide of every possible civilization. Sooner or later - at least in our group - however, someone will start asking questions such as "is this really the right course of action?" or "aren't we being a bit inconsiderate towards these other civilizations?" Of course this is somewhat discussed in the book (and on these forums as well). There are the "rogue troopers" questioning the entire system as well as the directives preventing the 3:16 ever returning to Earth. Still, I feel this aspect of the game makes the whole thing much more interesting than the initial impression of a gun-happy slugfest, and widens 3:16's scope a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is simply a stream of questions that popped into my mind, and I'd love it if some of them actually got discussed here:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a 3:16 campaign always going to follow an arc of fun--&gt;tragic?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you actually run 3:16 and escape all the inconvenient ethical questions?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf/when those questions start cropping up, it's going to be a challenge for both the GM and the players to move the game in another direction. How might this be accomplished?<br/>\n<br/>\nCould a 3:16 campaign be more like Platoon/Cross of Iron and less like Starship Troopers/Rambo?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go down the Platoon route, do you venture too far from the beer and pretzels -mindset laid down in the rules?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince in 3:16 the rules and the setting go pretty much hand in hand, how far can you stray from the setting and still be playing 3:16? When are you simply playing a war-themed scifi-rpg using 3:16 rules?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as a disclaimer I have to say that I like the game a lot. This post shouldn't be taken as a critique towards 3:16 or of the game's handling (or rather not-handling) of ethical issues, as I really like the way the game describes the setting and gives you the standard propaganda without outright hitting you over the head with the "right" answers. For a GM who has a bad habit of making D&amp;D; dungeoncrawlers deal with orphaned orc babies and evil cultists with loving families, 3:16 is pretty much a wet dream.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184170/#Comment_184170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T16:07:37+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  4:07PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: manatic</cite>If you go down the Platoon route, do you venture too far from the beer and pretzels -mindset laid down in the rules?</blockquote>\nI never got the impression this was a beer &amp; pretzels game.

Even if you play the game without the characters making a negative note of the atrocities of their missions, that would most likely only serve as a pointer for the players to discuss/think about it after the game. Sometimes trying to ignore a thing will make it more relevant in the afterthought.<br><br>About the fun-tragic -campaign structure...I think it's more a question of perspective and how you set up the game. (if this ends up sounding like a mad ramble, I blame the fact it's 4am here)<br><br>For a gritty game that you don't want to feel like a fun alien-killing-fest even from the start, make the combat sparse and way less trigger-happy (clearing 3-threat tokens on a 3 trooper group is nice, fun and fast, 5 vs 3 is far grittier) and use color, especially the NPCs, and opportunities for NFA-rolls, to create an environment where it's not all easy and where E-Cannons, while destructive, aren't kings. This place is nothing but hell-on-[something-resembling-Earth], and all those we rely end up killed because we're too weak to keep them alive. Living a life like that before getting promoted to an Officer should really make for a different tone than "let's go kill bugs" "yeaaah!". A dark campaign from start to finish.<br><br>I think a campaign that starts in fun and ends in fun would first and foremost be high on "the one with most firepower solves most problems" -scale. The grunt's attitude towards war would be something akin to extreme sports - the bigger kicks you get from a mission the better. New world with new bugs would mean a new challenge, and while death would be tragic -- everyone is seeking it on some level anyways. Also to keep the darker tones from really creeping in, incompetence and blindness to the situation could replace corruption and doubt in such a campaign. This would mean that the characters would less likely end up serving as scapegoats by the bureaucrats and more likely to be on  missions the clear up the screw-ups of others. (And while incompetence could become hard to maintain in the later game, adding levels after levels of incompetent leaders could lead to a variant of Hatred for Home that as a result has the characters go, guns blazing, against a real threat against Earth while the Brigadier has ordered the rest of the fleet to wage war against  "Any creatures you find that are green. Or cyan, if you think they feel greenish")<br><br>I don't really know if it would be possible to pull off a reverse (tragic-&gt;fun) without it being a bit awkward. I guess the game itself does promote the fun-&gt;tragic structure the best, as the characters start Strengths ready and the opposition as something they should be able to take with just guns. And slowly start to get to more serious spots as the team runs out of heroics and stats getting into trouble, people actually dying, all while getting more responsibility on a war that will never end.<br><br/>In any case, going some other route than the one in the book would first mean talking with the players about it before playing. Let the players know what the tone is, and discuss for example what sort of Strengths and Weaknesses play best for the new mood.<br/><br/>(Also, after writing this I have a strange urge of running a sort of a Breaking the Ice / 3:16 crossover. Couple of grunts, 3 planets, 3 alien cultures to destroy, 3 dates.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184196/#Comment_184196" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T18:46:22+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  6:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>Why so serious?<br/><br/>My players (hardcore D&amp;D hack and slashers, the lot of them) have been running on four sessions without any of those questions coming up, and none are in sight.

No. As the others have mentioned before me, it really comes down to your play group. If no one in your group has ever considered whether the orc they're killing has a mate and young at home, whether the guard they've just killed to get at the king's jewelry is just doing his job, then I doubt the tragic part of 3:16 will ever rear its head. This is a perfectly acceptable way to play 3:16. It is also, IMO, a less rewarding way to play it. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you actually run 3:16 and escape all the inconvenient ethical questions?<br/>\n<br/>\nSee above answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf/when those questions start cropping up, it's going to be a challenge for both the GM and the players to move the game in another direction. How might this be accomplished?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust play it hard. There are a few rules questions to be on the lookout for, where the rules deliberately don't answer your questions. Some people have considered this bad design, others consider it the fruitful void. I don't care either way, because when the question came up, I ruled, my players agreed, we continued. It might be a good idea to consider, up front, how you're going to handle Trooper vs Trooper issues. Two in particular that I've seen:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you treat an NPC Trooper outside of a planet scenario? My answer, stat him up as appropriate, and play it just like PvP, just don't give him Strengths or Weaknesses. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you handle it when 1 PC wants to use a Strength in a conflict with another? There are two schools of thought on this. Gregor's answer is to have the Strength inflict 1 kill on all opposing PCs, unless they use a Weakness to save themselves. Some, myself included after some discussion, feel that this is weak, and have ruled that you can kill any/all opposing PCs, unless they use a Weakness to save themselves. (You cannot use a Strength in response to a Strength). This is something you may want to decide either for yourself, or with your group, as you feel is best. Feelings can be hurt either way you go, so be careful. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould a 3:16 campaign be more like Platoon/Cross of Iron and less like Starship Troopers/Rambo?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. Ideally, both. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go down the Platoon route, do you venture too far from the beer and pretzels -mindset laid down in the rules?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook closer. Are you SURE that the rules encourage a beer and pretzels mindset? Are you absolutely sure?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince in 3:16 the rules and the setting go pretty much hand in hand, how far can you stray from the setting and still be playing 3:16? When are you simply playing a war-themed scifi-rpg using 3:16 rules?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you're talking about literally leaving the setting, and playing in some other setting, I don't follow you. So long as you're playing Troopers of the 3:16 with all the rules intact, you're playing 3:16. Your characters are free to make their own decisions, even if that means turning against their orders, or each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184202/#Comment_184202" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T19:28:31+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  7:28PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikko, I think 3:16 works anywhere from comedy to serious.

Luckily we have a very experienced group, so consensus was pretty much instant.\n<blockquote>Look closer. Are you SURE that the rules encourage a beer and pretzels mindset? Are you absolutely sure?</blockquote>\nConsidering that a lot of people <i>seem</i> to be playing it that way, the rules IMO imply it. Of course you could interpret the whole game - including the author's advice - as being totally ironically written. Which of course is a valid interpretation. Still, quotes such as:<br/><i><br/>Play is fun, so embrace the kill-happy machismo and play with it. <br/>It\u2019s not work, right? You shouldn\u2019t be stressing over this.</i> <br/><br/>Add to this the way the rule mechanics for replacements work and the idea of the ultimate expendability of characters (from a rules' point of view), the kill counters et al and I'd say that yes, the game does initially come across as a b&amp;p-game, while it of course implicitly points at a different style of game altogether. Even the most explicit hints, Hatred for Home and the brigadier's directives, can simply be interpreted as the troops being so kill-happy that they'll scourge any planet eventually. So we're not talking for instance about World of Darkness games which are explicitly <i>serious</i> and <i>tragic</i> in nature.\n<blockquote>Unless you're talking about literally leaving the setting, and playing in some other setting, I don't follow you.

If you devise a game-show rpg around say...Trivial Pursuit, where every wrong answer gets the player injured, are you still playing TP or an rpg using TP mechanics? The question here is mainly philosophical, of course. In 3:16 the system and the setting are integrated to a high level. For instance, in 3:16 the brigadier is THE brigadier. There is not A brigadier. And I don't know if I'm making any sense.<br/><br/>This discussion closely resembles the one about Verhoeven's Starship Troopers. Is it a heavily satirical war critique, or a sickeningly macho war movie? All my money's on the former, but surprisingly not everyone agrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184228/#Comment_184228" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T03:33:17+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  3:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2008 3:36AM by renatoram.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: manatic</cite>Considering that a lot of people<i>seem</i>to be playing it that way, the rules IMO imply it.

You can play Dogs with a team of torquemada inquisitors, even if that's not really the point. You can play DnD with a group of pacifist healers going 'round dungeons like Doctors Without Borders teams to relieve the pains of the poor goblin and kobold tribes. If you (and all the other players) are having fun,  you're probably doing it right, even if *it* might not be what the author intended <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manatic" title="manatic"><img alt="manatic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manatic">manatic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184230/#Comment_184230" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T04:06:06+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  4:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><br/>...and also the explicitly stated intent of the author, at least on the intarnets: the book leaves things deliberately unstated.

Still, you have to really pay attention to the text, as the ironic tone can quite easily be lost amidst the comic illustrations and the humorous quotes and so on. It would be interesting to know which percentage of 3:16 players never have that "wait, what?" moment of illumination (BTW JuddG's post, above, is a beautiful example of the game setting suddenly flipping around), and play it as space-D&amp;D. Neither style is of course wrong or right, as you noted.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see whether 3:16 will be remembered by the roleplaying crowd as an ingenious satire of racism, genocide and warmongering in the guise of a fairly light-hearted action romp, or a black, twisted game glorifying genocide, racism and war. Or it might become "cool", such as WH40K, which it draws heavy influence from. Funnily enough, WH40K is a fairly family-friendly game in its marketing <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184263/#Comment_184263" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T10:56:55+00:00" title="December 19, 2008 10:56AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Yes..

Grimdark fantasy about keeping home safe from the bad-guys without ever really peeling back the subtext so the trooper never steps back and looks at what they are doing (but as a player you are almost forced to).  I even used Space Marine figures when we played.<br/><br/>I gather many groups sit in teh middle ground - not bringing more meaning into the goings on than the player brings to it for themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184399/#Comment_184399" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T10:05:35+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 10:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2008 10:05AM by NomdePlume.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: manatic</cite><br/>This discussion closely resembles the one about Verhoeven's Starship Troopers.

Although I'd rephrase your question to: Is it a heavily satirical war critique, or a hilariously macho war movie? Answer: it's both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
