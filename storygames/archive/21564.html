Specifically, I\u2019m using the \u201c<b>Monster Reaction Table\u201d from Labyrinth Lord</b>:<br/><br/>2d6   Result<br/>2   Friendly, helpful<br/>3-5   Indifferent, uninterested<br/>6-8   Neutral, uncertain<br/>9-11   Unfriendly, may attack<br/>12   Hostile, attacks<br/><br/>However, I\u2019ve noticed that I am only using them intermittently and am often frustrated.<br/><br/>Firstly, I feel that the majority of results (6-8 but also 3-5) are <b>inconclusive</b>, which means I often find myself re-rolling. Also, I consider adventurers too tasty, threatening and unusual to garner such responses (or I am misreading "neutral" -- see more on that below).<br/><br/>Secondly, I feel that drastic, <b>interesting results (i.e. 2 and 12) don\u2019t happen often enough</b>. <br/><br/>(I should note that I\u2019m usually using the table unmodified, as even a +1 can have a massive effect. So far, I\u2019ve only considered modifiers for creatures such a as a demon whose very presence creates strife within a radius of several miles of the dungeon where it is imprisoned.)<br/><br/>I\u2019m currently planning to change the table as follows:<br/><br/>2d6   Result<br/>2-3   Catastrophically bad (often hostile, with a mechanical benefit, e.g. no need for morale checks)<br/>4-5   Bad (i.e. worse than by default; in many cases this means an immediate fight or flight response)<br/>6-8   Neutral (i.e. the default reaction by outlook, e.g. \u201caloof\u201d, \u201cbelligerent\u201d, \u201chungry\u201d etc.)<br/>9-10   Good (i.e. better than by default; in many cases this means interested and open to negotiation)<br/>11-12   Phenomenally good (often very friendly, seeking cooperation)<br/><br/>As you can see, I have flipped the table and \u2026<br/>(a)\t<b>tripled the likelihood of edge results</b> (now 1 in 12 each) and made them more extreme.<br/>(b)\t<b>use a creature's default behavior for "neutral" results</b> (as per creature outlook from Rolemaster's "Creatures &amp; Treasures", by the way) which makes aggression the most likely result for most monsters and cautious interest for most NPCs.<br/><br/>Finally and perhaps most importantly, I plan to tighten my procedures and use the table f<b>or just about any creature the characters encounter</b> for the first time (unless I have a very clear idea of its goals, personality etc. -- and even then, I might decide to consult the dice to see if it has a bad day etc.).<br/><br/>I hope this will shake things up (by forcing me to improvise more) and lead to chaos, mayhem, unlooked-for alliances and strange pets!<br/><br/>What do you think about these adjustments?<br/>And how do YOU handle monster and NPC reactions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471478/#Comment_471478" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T22:35:22+00:00" title="April  6, 2018 10:35PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the reaction table from Classic Traveller:<br/><br/>REACTIONS<br/>Die Reaction<br/>2 Violent.

Flipping the numbers makes a great deal of sense to me, that's a nice touch. <br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>* If you have a good source for "a creature's default behaviour", your fix there works. However, I don't know where you're getting that, or what it looks like. Tell us more? <br/><br/>* I think that the "extreme" results only work/make sense if you often apply modifiers to the roll, in which case they are more useful. (As "2 or less" and "12 or higher", respectively.)<br/><br/>I collected the following notes a few years back, although I now don't know where I copied and pasted this from. Maybe it will be interesting or useful - this could even become a thread for various OSR reaction tables.\n<blockquote>[...] appearing in the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons, book 1, on page 12. It appears as follows;<br/><br/>2 Attacks immediately<br/>3-5 Hostile reaction<br/>6-8 Uncertain, make another offer, roll again<br/>9-11 Accepts offer, friendly<br/>12 Enthusiastic, volunteers help<br/><br/>As you can see, it is slightly more complicated than even 6-/7-9/10-11/12+, but the principle is the same. This reaction table was repeated in the Holmes edition of D&amp;D (1977, page 11), the Moldvay edition of Basic D&amp;D (1981, page B21), and the Mentzer Red Box edition of Basic D&amp;D (1983, Dungeon Master's Rulebook page 20).<br/><br/>When it appeared in the Rules Cyclopedia (1991, page 93), it had changed slightly:<br/><br/>2-3 Monster attacks<br/>4-6 Monster is aggressive<br/>7-9 Monster is cautious<br/>10-11 Monster is neutral<br/>12 Monster is friendly</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471480/#Comment_471480" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T22:45:24+00:00" title="April  6, 2018 10:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was working on an OSR-style game (but with different dice mechanics) for a while, called <i>Kroll</i>. Here's my Reaction Roll table from that game (I never got to play it, though):<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fir1ljvxo9tne96/Kroll%20Reaction%20Rolls.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Kroll Reaction Rolls</a><br/><br/>I still really like this.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>1. The difficulty is the number each die has to beat to count as a "hit". So, at Hard (4) difficulty, each die rolling a 5 or higher counts as a "hit".<br/><br/>2. One disadvantage of this method compared to the more generic OSR-style reaction chart we're discussing in this thread is that the encounter must <i>first</i> be categorized as "social" or "potentially violent". If I were to use this, I might occasionally want to randomize which it is (or base it on some in-game conceit, like the random encounter table being used) before rolling on it, in situations where either could be a possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471481/#Comment_471481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T22:45:48+00:00" title="April  6, 2018 10:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't go look at the OD&amp;D table, but it clearly matches well with the Traveller table, which is not surprising since Marc Miller is on record as having walked through the D&amp;D books in writing Traveller.

If that's what you can run in an even-handed and consistent way, then rock on. I particularly like explicit default behaviors.<br/><br/>I'll explain how I use the reaction checks when I use them (historically I haven't much, but I've done it enough to have a procedure). I think that the following is semi-textual for historical D&amp;D, in case somebody cares about that - I don't remember where I picked this up, but it could well be in some DMG somewhere.<br/><br/>First, just as the rules describe, I figure out an initial attitude with the simple dice roll. This roll should not involve any character-based adjustments because it's not a diplomacy check - it determines the attitude in the immediate moment of encounter, before anybody even opens their mouths.<br/><br/>If there are any modifiers (and even the monster's type could cause some - some are more likely to be friendly than others), I strongly prefer bonus and penalty dice (that is, roll multiple dice and pick the best/worst) over static bonuses; the math is simply better. This is a pretty common trend in how I use old D&amp;D rules stuff, anyway.<br/><br/>Once we have an initial attitude, that attitude strongly determines what the party can gain from this monster, in general terms: "Friendly" gets you tolerance and weapons put away, "Indifferent" suffices for terse advice, "Neutral" suffices for superficial commerce, "Unfriendly" suffices for potentially getting to leave without combat (after a payment of tribute, perhaps). I describe the monster's behavior to the players, but do not tell them which attitude tier I rolled (without some sort of insight maneuver, of course).<br/><br/>(The players know the rules I'm using, of course, even if they don't know the entire game state at a given time.)<br/><br/>If the party opts for parley or other action that does not immediately end the encounter or begin combat, we enter what basically amounts to a social conflict resolution system: the rounds are one minute long, like in combat, and the procedure ends when either the attitude hits one of the extremes ("Friendly" and "Hostile" are stable and permanent, unless something starts a new parley conflict), or the encounter ends. Essentially, the three mid-range attitudes are all understood as fleeting moments of parley; the situation <i>must</i> crash into either Friendly or Hostile soon, for that is the nature of parley.<br/><br/>During each parley round the party may attempt to improve the attitude of the opposition (reveal stuff about themselves to gain trust, roll charisma checks, etc.), gain a boon from them (information, gifts, etc.), surprise attack them (easier at higher trust, of course), or whatever. Monster attitude generally worsens every round <i>unless</i> the party succeeds in some proactive maneuver; these dungeon parleys are quick and tense affairs, the monsters grow bored and hostile if you waste time and don't convince them quickly.<br/><br/>The monster may, of course, also make parley maneuvers. If they do, the first mover gets to do their thing each round - unlike combat, in parley only one thing is occurring at once. Just like adventurer maneuvers, if a monster maneuver fails it generally worsens the disposition by one step.<br/><br/>(Multiple PCs may wish to run the parley together. If they do, they should take turns conducting rounds of negotiations. Multiple people talking over each other is an automatic failure.)<br/><br/>This approach means that rolling one of the mid-level results in the initial reaction check is not the vague and mild thing you make it out to be: rather, it sets the stage for parley. Essentially, the result you roll determines how many rounds the players get to putz around and try to avoid combat before the monster decides that enough is enough and attacks them.<br/><br/>Note that outright hostility being rare is not an issue here because most parleys either never get off the ground (what do you offer a non-intelligent monster?) or fail anyway. For example, a monster that both notices the party first and gets an ambiguous result will likely observe them from hiding for however many rounds it takes them to gather their courage and attack (or decide that the adventurers are too tough to take on, of course). Context obviously matters: one "Unfriendly" will just want to get away, while another just needs that one round of hesitation to decide on the lethal option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471485/#Comment_471485" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T23:00:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2018 11:00PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty interesting, Eero. I feel like one could, if desired, mechanize that final paragraph a little more:<br/><br/>For instance, on an Unfriendly result, a monster makes a Morale check, and, on a success, attacks. On a failure, it tries to keep it distance and will fight only if intruded upon.<br/><br/>Something like that.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I find that often enough the fictional circumstances are sufficient to give me an idea of what two possible attitudes for the creature are, and then I can randomize between them somehow (a Morale check or a Charisma check seem like obvious options).<br/><br/>However, it seems that your approach has the same drawback as my Kroll table - it doesn't have a general-use application to an undetermined encounter (like stumbling across a group of farmers in the woods, who, presumably, don't turn fully Hostile every time they talk to uncharismatic strangers).

Is that correct, or did I miss something (or perhaps you have a different strategy in those types of encounters)?</p></div></blockquote>\nThe thing to do is to have some dice modifiers, and have flexible ideas of what a given monster <i>does</i> in a given attitude.<br/><br/>So with those farmers in the woods you get a bonus die to the reaction roll because as civilians they're not likely to attack a person (I would give e.g. faeries that same bonus); that drops the probability of outright hostility from 3% to 0.5%, which I'm entirely comfortable with. You could walk into the middle of a sorry misunderstanding or a psychotic break, after all; that's the whole point of the reaction roll, to find out.<br/><br/>Any other result aside from "Hostile" means that I'm entitled to have the farmers attempt to avoid or escape the encounter; they don't need to want to fight. "Unfriendly" could mean "afraid of", for instance. They would only respond aggressively if the PCs force them to stay, which seems quite reasonable. As you said, we can roll Morale to determine it if there's uncertainty.<br/><br/>That being said, I think that the whole concept of reaction checks and monster parley should only be used for those  first impressions and initial social maneuvers in an encounter. The way I explain it is that the moment you put away your sword because it's clear that it's not going to be a fight, that's the moment you hit "Friendly" and the parley becomes a real conversation. This means that the vast majority of social encounters occur <i>after</i> the initial parley stage. And, of course, in civilized environs the parleys tend to be automatically successful: even if we for some reason rolled for shop-keeper attitude (maybe your character is a non-human in a racist town or something) and you got something less than Friendly, you could just basically stand there making auto-successful small talk for a couple of minutes to get up to Friendly and stop wondering whether the other guy's going to stab you. Can't run a shop if you're going to decide to attack strangers coming into your shop, after all.<br/><br/>(You can engage in social maneuvers at other stances than "Friendly", but those are really different and much more volatile situations. It is precisely the difference between on the one hand talking to a guy and on the other hand talking to a guy while suspecting that they might want to kill you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471493/#Comment_471493" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-07T07:40:38+00:00" title="April  7, 2018  7:40AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2018 7:44AM by DeReel.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are doing a new table anyway and are ready to use 2D, why not follow to the end : use each die for a different info ?

Paul's table for Kroll nicely covers multiple situations with the same mechanic. Which brings me to the next point:<br/><br/>2) One reason to stick to something coarser (like 2d6 with just five or seven results) is broad applicability. I want to use the table for wild animals, monsters and NPCs (both in civilised and uncertain circumstances). A hostile shopkeeper might discriminate against the PCs, try to offload a cursed item on them, pass on information to the local thieves' guild so they are robbed later etc.  <br/><br/>(I should note that I am happy to add details with potentially a lot of impact here, e.g. turning a previously faceless shopkeeper into a contact, fence or member of the local thieves' guild or an orc patrol into a group of mutineers.)<br/><br/>3) Another reason to stick to 2d6 might be that one could roll one of the two dice in the open, to give the players some idea of how things might turn out. An intriguing idea I picked up at The Mule Abides. What do you make of that?<br/><br/>4) For a creature's default outlook, I have turned to "Creatures &amp; Treasures I-III", Rolemaster's equivalent to the Monster Manual. Most creatures have a default outlook from a list of about twenty entries, each described by a line of text. Some examples:<br/><br/>Aloof \tIgnores other creatures unless interfered with, or attacked.<br/>Carefree \tDoes not believe that danger or misfortune exists for it.<br/>Cruel \tNot only hostile, but delights in death, pain, and suffering.<br/>Jumpy \tNormally bolts at any sign of other creatures.<br/><br/>The list is not particularly systematic, in that it mixes goals such as "hungry" (the default for most predatory animals, for instance) with tactics or character traits such as "belligerent". I find it useful, though.<br/><br/>5) I really like the ideas of the monsters' attitude worsening turn by turn during negotiations (unless the PCs are proactive and succeed) and automatic failure for talking over each other. In my group, this phase often devolves into a free-for-all, let's-see-what-overtures-stick. A tightening of procedures as Eero outlines is exactly what I am looking for. In this context, the 'inconclusive' results I bemoaned earlier make sense: <b>Limited</b> extra time to turn things around if you come up with something worthwhile to offer (and manage to 'sell' it).<br/><br/>6) After determining initial reaction, I switch to a mix of negotiation and d20 die rolls (e.g. a Personality check for the lead negotiator with an ad-hoc bonus for the party sheathing their weapons).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471495/#Comment_471495" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-07T11:24:46+00:00" title="April  7, 2018 11:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2018 11:26AM by Krippler.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a reaction table on the assumption that most creatures are very careful to get into deadly fights, especially with an unusual force such as an adventuring party.<br/><br/>The negative side of the table has the entries:<br/><br/><b>May attack</b> - won't under the current circumstance, but if the party displays vulnerability or some great profit they will<br/><br/><b>Will attack</b> - will attack under current circumstance, unless the party displays an unknown strength or remarkable poverty, submission and consessions might also prevent attacks.<br/><br/><b>Does attack</b> - self explanatory                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471496/#Comment_471496" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-07T13:09:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2018  1:09PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Well there are two points that differ. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Common ground means you need to share a common language, a neutral or better previous history, and be on roughly equal footing for talking.
