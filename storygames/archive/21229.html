In the course of this \u201cguide\u201d, I\u2019ll mostly follow the levels outlined <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/464850/#Comment_464850" rel="nofollow">in my earlier post</a>, ie. going roughly from least-additional-effort to most-value-added.</p>\n<p>This guide probably won\u2019t go into questions like why somebody would want to do that, beyond \u201cSome people want to make it easier for other people to use their work in their own. Here\u2019s one way to do that.\u201d.</p>\n<p> I'll try my best to give an introduction, but I'd love for people to correct me where I make mistakes and add their own guide and advice below. Let's collect as many guides and best-pratices as possible!</p>\n<h2 id="explicit-permissive-license">1. Explicit, permissive license</h2>\n<p>(Disclaimer: IANAL)</p>\n<p>The first step here is basially to give explicit, understandable and probably-legal permission for other people to use your work. While in most cases, like \u201cSomebody wants to use my work in their home game\u201d, just publishing your game for free on the internet might be enough, this would still prohibit people from (legally) republishing your stuff or reusing it in their own published work.</p>\n<p>So to allow that and give others a sense of legal security in their reuse, an explicit open license is probably the best way to do that. For the kind of work we\u2019re mostly talking about in game design, there are two licences currently in use to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Open Gaming License</p></li>\n<li><p>Creative Commons</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which licence to use is ... a complicated issue, somewhat depending on personal preferences, wether you yourself are reusing work published under one of those licences, your intended or suspected audience, and so on...</p>\n<p>The OGL is (almost) exclusively used in the gaming scene, especially in the subscene of d20/D&amp;D-descedant games. Its often described as complicated and opaque and as such is probably not the easiest to use correctly.</p>\n<p>The Creative Commons licences are a family of open licences intended to be used for creative work like text, images, music and so on. It\u2019s widely used both in and outside of gaming, has lots of material published under it and has been translated to a bunch of different languages.</p>\n<p>Though I should say \u201cthem\u201d, since there are several seperate licences, allowing for different types of reuse.</p>\n<p>All CC licences allow the free distribution of the oroginal, unedited work and from then on vary what other uses they allow and under what conditions. (For more information on <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" rel="nofollow">how CC licences work</a>, <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees" rel="nofollow">considerations before using them</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">a tool to help you choose a license</a> check out the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons website</a>. )</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re aiming for maximum freedom-to-reuse, consider publishing your work under a CC-BY license or CC-0 license.</p>\n<h2 id="easily-reusableeditable-file-formats">2. Easily reusable/editable file formats</h2>\n<p>Personally, this one is an even bigger deal than the open licensing: Most rpg publishing today happens in print and/or using pdfs as the digital publidhing format. Both of those make it pretty hard to resuse content, as getting the necessary information out can be a lot of work. Scanning and running OCR software in a printed book is a lot of work, but extracting large portions of text from a pdf file isn\u2019t all that much easier. (Especially with the complicated multi-column layout so common in rpgs.)</p>\n<p>So if you want other people to reuse your work easily, publish it using other formats. For text, it\u2019s pretty hard to beat a plaintext file for usability, but html files and its derivates (Like epub.) are nice as well.</p>\n<p>If your work relies on image files in addition to text, publish the image files along with the plaintext/html files and/or zip it together for ease of download. Your image files should preferably use a high-enough to allow for print publishing and use some form of losslessly compressable image format like png, raw, bmp, lossless JPEG2000, etc.</p>\n<p>For audio ... I have no idea what besides wav and flac one oughta use here, but I guess the people who consider publishing their rpg audio/video in a free/open way know what formats to use best.

Added Markup</h2>\n<p>Publishing your stuff as plaintext is great, but chances are it won\u2019t look all that nice and be kinda hard to read. In print/pdf publishing, we use layout to make our work pretty, well-structured and easily readable, but to do so in plaintext world, we need to add some kind of structure or markup.</p>\n<p>When doing this, we need to consider how our work might be used down the line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will it be used to make print files?</li>\n<li>Incorporated in other work?</li>\n<li>Published on the web?</li>\n<li>Read in the plaintext version?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To cover as many possible usecases as possible, it\u2019s best to use established and (mostly) standardized markup formats like Markdown or HTML. Both are widely used, so there are lots of tools to import them into layout programs, convert them into other, more specialized formats like LaTeX, XML or Mediawiki Markup or just publish them looking nicely.</p>\n<p>(To go into more detail, I will now focus on Markdown, as it\u2019s pretty powerful, widely used and easy to write.)</p>\n<p>To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" rel="nofollow">quote Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Markdown has been in development for a while now and while there are a couple of different implementations of it out there, the core of its syntax has IMO been pretty stable now, with the various versions just extending that core.</p>\n<h3 id="the-basics">The basics:</h3>\n<p>Markdown was designed as an easy Markup that converts to (x)html, as such it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" rel="nofollow">thinks in similar concepts as html</a>. It\u2019s plain text with bits of syntax added which add meaning to the text and mark it up to signify information like \u201cthis is a link\u201d or \u201cthis is a heading\u201d. (Here\u2019s a link to the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" rel="nofollow">original syntax specification</a>.)</p>\n<p>If you write some plain text, it will be valid markdown, probably a bunch of paragraphs.</p>\n<pre><code>This is one paragraph.<br/><br/>This is another.<br/><br/>This is a third,  <br/>Which consists of two lines.<br/></code></pre>\n<p>Chances are you want to structure your text, for example by added headings. Here we once again see that Markdown is thinking kinda like html in that it has six levels of heading:</p>\n<pre><code># This is a top level heading<br/><br/>This is some text under that.<br/><br/>## Level 2 Header<br/><br/>### Level 3 Header<br/><br/>### You can of course have multiple headers of each level<br/><br/>##### Or skip some.<br/></code></pre>\n<p>Markdown also supports a different style for the first two levels which some might prefer:</p>\n<pre><code>First Level<br/>===========<br/><br/>Some Text.<br/><br/><br/>Second Level<br/>------------<br/></code></pre>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to <em>emphasize</em> something or make a <strong>bold statement</strong>. You can do that in Markdown as well.</p>\n<pre><code>I want to _emphasize_ that people are making **bold choices**!</code></pre>\n<p>You can do Blockquotes, email-style:</p>\n<pre><code>Some text:<br/><br/>&gt; This is a Quote!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a nested Quote.<br/>&gt; &gt; WITH TO LINES EVEN!!!</code></pre>\n<p>You can list things:</p>\n<pre><code>Reasons I love lists:<br/><br/>* Its a reason to use asterisks.<br/>* Enumeration is fun!<br/>* Also I\u2019m a deeply forgetful person who relies on todo lists.</code></pre>\n<p>And of course you can also use links and images. After all, we\u2019re thinking like HTML.</p>\n<pre><code>I sure love [Story Games](http://story-games.com/forum/)!<br/><br/>Especially it\u2019s frontpage:<br/><br/>![Story Games Frontpage Image, a city drawn in child-book style](http://story-games.com/story1.jpg)</code></pre>\n<p>I think these cover the basics, you can also try this <a href="http://www.markdowntutorial.com/" rel="nofollow">Markdown Tutorial</a> or check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/lordminx/95d113a5734efd241916dcf105df1b70" rel="nofollow">Markdown source I originally wrote this guide in</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have something written in Markdown and you want to use it, there are tools to convert it to other stuff!

XD<br/><br/>But a bit more seriously: My first instinct was to say no-unless-the-alternative-is-pdf, thinking that odt files are only used by the open-/libreoffice family, but after a bit of research it seems that there is quite a number of tools for multiple platforms that can both read and write it, so I changed my position to "probably, with one caveat":<br/><br/>I suspect that odt would be a problem if you or your collaborators intend to use git for your work down the line. (While versioning them localy presumably works, <a href="https://medium.com/@dis_is_patrick/git-for-non-programmers-49c85d3f647d" rel="nofollow">merging probably breaks them</a>, severely limiting the utility of a distributed versioning system.)<br/><br/>That said, there are tools that <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html" rel="nofollow">read odt and output Markdown</a>, so maybe this would be less of a problem even in this case. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465180/#Comment_465180" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T07:03:32+00:00" title="July 31, 2017  7:03AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A conversion from ODT to markdown is going to be very lossy in the general case.

(It's a spinoff, not the original, if that makes any sense somewhere outside my brain.)<br/><br/>That said, forking or cloning a repo is the prerequisite for Pull Requests, which is why you collaborate with somebody without them giving you push access to their repo. A pull request is basically a commit/a series of commits which you can send to the maintainer and basically say "Hey, here are some changes I made, please incorporate ("pull") them into your repo."<br/><br/>Thus: Pull Request. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If I see it correctly you already tried to create a pull request, but in your own repo. This is, amusingly, possible, but not the way people generall do it. Normally, you interact with your own (forked or otherwise) repo by normal add/commit/push/pull processes, while pull requests are for moving changes between repos.<br/><br/>So, unless I'm mistaken (Somebody with more Github experience correct me here) the next steps would be:<br/><br/>(0. Accept your own pull request, so your changes are in your master branch. This is technically optional, since you can have whatever in your master, but it makes things more intuitive, IMO.)<br/><br/>1. Go to my repo and <a href="https://github.com/lordminx/Open-Game-Design-Link-Collection/pull/new/master" rel="nofollow">create a new pull request</a> for the changes in your fork. I will then be poked by Github and proceed to...<br/><br/>2. Pull your changes, check them out and (most likely) merge them into the repo. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(If I'm not mistaken I could also just add your repo as a remote to my local repo and pull changes that way, but that's largely invisible, less explicit and probably a bad idea.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" title="Tam_H"><img alt="Tam_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">Tam_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465242/#Comment_465242" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T18:21:23+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  6:21PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Despite using git daily, I've never done a pull request.

I thought that I was supposed to add the file I made to Lord_Minx repo but I didn't got authorization for that nor for creating files at first, all I could do was to fork and make my own repo from it.<br/><br/>So, as far as I get it, as a collaborator you need to :<br/><br/>1- Write down whatever you want to collaborate with in markup. This could be made easier for those who don't know anything about markup by using tools like <a href="http://dillinger.io/" rel="nofollow">dillinger.io</a> or <a href="https://stackedit.io/editor" rel="nofollow">StackEdit</a><br/><br/>2-Copypaste or save the text as a txt document on your pc (I did saved it in google drive through StackEdit but to upload it to github I had to copypaste to a txt doc on my pc, it seemed less convoluted.<br/><br/>3-Make a git account, go to the link to Lord_Minx repo above, fork it to make a repo on your github account as you don't have authorization to do anything to other poeple's repo.<br/><br/>4-Upload the file to your repo (dunno why you can ask a pull request to yourself but if you do, you've got to accept it)<br/><br/>5-Go to Lord_Minx's repo link above and click the button "new pull request", which will prompt you to the Compare Changes screen that got me puzzled for hours when I hadn't figured out the forking thingie. <br/><br/>6-There you will need to click where it says <i>compare across forks</i> and chose to compare <i>master: lordminx/Open-Game-Design-Link-Collection</i> to your fork (head: <i>whateveryournickis</i>/Open-Game-Design-Link-Collection)<br/><br/>I'm not sure now but I think there were another pull request button or commit button there to confirm. Now it looks like it's in your pull request list.

But intsead of server_host you need to put the address to your web server. In my case, idiomdrottning.org.

You can waive SA for that special friend you trust, say, or waive NC for the team who wants to run a crowdfunding for their derivative game and promises to give you a cut of the money (in fact, I suppose that's what people hope for when they choose NC; unfortunately, that's an entirely theoretical example).</li>\n<li>In practice, I believe CC BY-NC for a role-playing game will end up working the same as Vincent Baker's informal non-license: <i>"ask me whether you can use the AW engine; I'll probably say yes"</i> - though perhaps if you went for NC in the first place you'd OK different things than Vx routinely does (that's your right and privilege).</li>\n<li>An aside: part of my original reasoning for first choosing SA was as an effective alternative to NC. My reasoning back then: the kind of people who would try and make money from my work but not throw a penny my way are, psychologically, the kind of people who wouldn't touch SA with a 10' pole, for fear of the same happening to them. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/></li>\n<li>If you're really not worried about the above, CC BY (or perhaps CC0, see below) most likely offers the greatest compatibility and widest range or reusability than any license. The actual reasons for using CC BY-SA (including my own insisting on it) are political: sacrificing some potential compatibility for the sake of participating in an activist movement. Truth is, people who have opposing political views might give up reusing your work specifically on the ground of its licensing - any copyleft activist is willing to take this risk, the trade-off being an opportunity to bring in more people.</li>\n<li><a href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">@Lord_Minx</a> also mentioned CC0, which isn't a license, exactly, but a legal device to make your work effectively public domain (inasmuch as that's possible). That's a complex topic of its own. For our purpose, however, going CC0 is a bit like waiving the "BY" from CC BY: you want people to be able to reuse your work as they please <i>even without</i> attributing it to you. CC0 is a bit like signing a statement that you won't, indeed, sue anybody for doing so.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
