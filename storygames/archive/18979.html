Only the GM (Gorgoneion) had played anything quite so freeform, but we took to it very quickly. It was one of those rare sessions where everything clicks and comes together perfectly. Very, very cool. (<a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/1067397/ghostecho-session-report-the-veil-of-reality" rel="nofollow">This is a repost from the session report on RPGGeek, made by fellow player Kattvippa!</a>, with some added commentary by me).<br/><br/><b>Setting</b><br/><br/>We're looting in the Ghost World and we're after <b>vaccine</b>, an antidote against the drug we have to use in order to get into the Ghost World in the first place. The Ghost World is actually called <b>The Darkness</b>. You can tap into The Darkness pretty much everywhere, provided you have the drug, Oneiros. When you travel in The Darkness, it doesn't matter how far you go there, you always wake up in your own chair. Connecting too much into The Darkness without the antidote will turn one into a Wraith. <br/><br/>The Darkness is only a shadow of the real world and there are peoples' memories floating around. If you're not careful, you can get sucked into a memory and never let out again.  Wraiths are stuck in their own memories, with no way out anymore. No secret can be kept as a secret from The Darkness. We suspect The Darkness is using the Wraiths as guards and in some other nasty business that is not for the faint of heart. <br/><br/>The Real World is a Victorian Steampunk one. Lately we've been connecting to The Darkness so much that the side-effects are starting to kick in. And we only have two doses of the vaccine left...<br/><br/><i>Setup was really smooth! Just like LB, G/E really works for a variety of settings. A bunch of us were pushing for hard sci-fi cyberpunk, but Victorian Steampunk junkies won out.</i><br/><br/><b>Players</b><br/><br/><b>Cable</b>, very strong, good at not getting stuck in the Darkness, a Killer (the first person in our session report)<br/><b>Venom</b>, the Drug Dealer <br/><b>Crane</b>, good at hiding.<br/><b>Nix</b>, good at getting into the Darkness in many ways, a junkie who's building up resistence against the drug. <br/><br/><b>The Night Carnival</b><br/><br/>We were going to do make our biggest score ever at the Night Carnival. Of course that did not happen, we were betrayed and ambushed by Wraiths, hot at our heels. The Night Carnival might have been beautiful, but we don't have time to stop looking into it. We're at a dark alley and hoping that the Wraiths won't see us. There are balloons and steam all around us. Even though it's dark, the city is lit with hundreds of gaslights for the Carnival. As we stand at the dark alley, we suddenly feel the Wraiths closing in on us. Suddenly it's cold despite the humid air and we know they will relentlessly pursue us, from here to oblivion. We suspect Chain sold us cheap. After all, he gave us the tip in the first place.<br/><br/><i>I've had other one-offs that started in medias res like this, but they usually failed to pick up speed because no one knew what they could do, what issues they could grab on to. But this worked very well. Genre-convention helps. I knew there would be flying dirigibles to grab, alleys to jump into, crowds to rouse and so on. Genre conventions are great!</i><br/><br/>We put Venetian mask on. You know, those beautiful mask with large feathers and all that. We try to blend in the masses and lose the Wraiths. As soon as we think we're off the hook, we see people dressed in white death gowns. Those people are also wearing completely black masks instead of the festive ones with feathers: they're Wraiths! <br/><br/>No matter where we look, the place is filled with those and other people don't seem to notice them at all. I make the run for it and for a moment I actually made it away from the Wraiths. Nix runs right after me, but as soon as he reaches me, he gets a punch on his stomach. As I'm quite a lot bigger than Nix, he doesn't start fight with me, instead he discovers that it's not me after all, it's a Wraith. Oh, did I not tell you? They can change themselves to look like anyone they want to. <br/><br/><i>Paranoia was running up a bit, and people started unintentionally imagining out loud what kind of horrible abilities the wraith might have. Very dangerous in such a free-flowing narrative game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></i><br/><br/>And it's anyone they want to: they don't have lives anymore so they crave for peoples' lives and do anything to suck it right out of them. So the Wraith starts strangling Nix and he tries to scream, but he can't. He tries to use the drug to get into The Darkness, but as they are in a form of eye drops, it's very hard since he's being strangled. So he drinks it, which comes with a price to pay as a side-effects. Just when he feels his life slipping away from him, he moves into The Darkness. He's out of the Wraiths hands and in a sea of darkness all around him. Nix barely makes it out of The Darkness because of the side-effects, but suddenly I see him coming out of the thin air.<br/><br/><i>It seems like we forgot that you can't really move in The Darkness - at startup we'd established that if you drop out of the Darkness, you are in the same place that you entered. Those little inconsistencies usually slip in in a game like this (right?) but here we find out it makes sense later.</i><br/><br/>In a mean while Venom is looking for a steam cart to fly us out of here. At the same time she finds one, she sees a Wraith with black feather closing in on her. She can't start the engine and she starts frantically pushing all the buttons and finally there's a satisfying sound as the engine starts and she feels the steam doing its work and getting the steam cart up in the air and just in time too. Crane waves to Venom and tries to signal her to drop a rope for us. She tries, but since she's only ever once even tried to fly one of those things, she breaks the steering mechanics and now the cart only goes left. <br/><br/><i>Best fail ever!</i><br/><br/>It's going in round and round and people start yelling "Thief! Thief" on the ground and throwing stones at her. The Wraiths are following the crowd. I decide that an accurate shot of stone on the right spot would steer the cart on the roof of the house Venom's next to, so I throw a stone, but my aim is no true and I miss my mark terribly. A true mayhem follows: the stone hit the cart in a bad possible way, sending it down on the house, crashing it totally. The stone also hit the crowd and there's a spray of blood. A Wraith sees me and sprints toward me, attacking. It's a terrible things straight from worst nightmares. It has rusty claws at the end of its hands and it starts clawing at me. I can feel the deep coldness creeping in me. Crane manages to save Nix, who's having bad side-effects and is mostly drooling at this point, not realizing what's happening around him.<br/><br/>There's a huge hole in the roof, where the steam cart crashed. The whole building starts collapsing and Venom is falling in the building. She tries to slip into The Darkness as she sees the floor approaching very fast. At the end of her flight she sees a statue that is holding a upward pointed sword. At the very last minute she manages to slip into The Darkness. A tiny drop of blood lingers on the tip of the sword in the real world. <br/><br/><i>Nice action narration, GM!</i><br/><br/>As she lands, she lands on something shadowy but hard. She realizes they are shadow babies, this was an orphanage. It's a terrible echo: the building burned down a century ago, wisps of smoke is gathering all around her. Suddenly one of the babies open its beady eyes, shadow worms starts crawling out of his eye sockets. Venom very carefully starts backing out, humming a lullaby. Another baby opens her eyes and starts following her, red-eyed, on all fours. She leaves tiny footprints on the dusty floor. <br/><br/><i>The first echo we see, it instantly sets the tone to spell out: echoes are bad news.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/juleske" title="juleske"><img alt="juleske" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/juleske">juleske</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424007/#Comment_424007" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T15:52:38+00:00" title="November  9, 2013  3:52PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Venom gets back into the real world, people see her and start yelling "Thief!" again and throwing stones at her. One of the stones hits her in her left arm and she can hear a sickening sound as her elbow is crushed by the large stone. She knows that if she stops, that'll be the end of her. Despite the pain making it hard to even see anything, she keeps running, searching desperately for us...<br/><br/>In the mean while I have my own troubles as I try to fight the Wraith. I manage to crush its other arm completely, but that only seems to make it angrier and it cuts my thigh badly with its rusty claw. I somehow manage to beat it after all, but don't really get a change to have a breather as I can hear a very angry mob getting closer. There's a door behind me and I break the lock, get in and as soon as Venom is at the door, I snatch her in, grapping her with both of my arms. I quickly shut the door and we can hear the angry mob passing by. <br/><br/>Nix is having a terrible hallucination at the same time nearby. He can see a terrifying truth about The Darkness, but there's a price to pay. His brain is getting damaged and his ears and nose starts bleeding, he soils himself. He realizes that we're living in an illusion, this is not the real world, we're still in The Darkness! As he finally comes to, he let's us know that he believes we're made to believe this is reality when this in fact is not.<br/><br/><i>Gha-ha! This is why the Wraith can enter reality and we can travel by 'going into the Darkness' - it's an extended illusion! I admit I was happy to add that story element, and the GM is very excited about this turn of events.</i><br/><br/><b>What Horrors Lies Beneath</b><br/><br/>We decide the best way to get into the bottom of all this is to try to find an Echo of the doctor who created the vaccine in the first place. As Nix has lingered in The Darkness a lot, he has an idea where to start. We walk to the place Nix thinks the good doctor's house should be and we send Crane to infiltrate in there. Crane sees houses number 10 and 13, but nothing in between. There are missing numbers. The houses are attached to each other, he can't even see a seam between them. The buildings are very different from each other, no architect would ever design these two houses to be attached to each other. So Crane walks at the back of the houses and sees that the doctor's house is in The Darkness, which is very unusual. And there's also a huge swarm of Wraiths there, like they would be guarding something. Crane gets back to where we wait for him and tells us what is going on. As Nix is listening to the Echoes, he suddenly start trembling and we can sort of almost see through him, he feels deader and it's apparent he's beginning to turn into a Wraith. <br/><br/><i>As I recall the goal was "Trying to channel the ghost world to get information" and "keeping your brain intact". I'm not sure if this is canon, but our GM would tell us flat out what the results would be if we picked a certain outcome. I think our GM phrased it as: "Pick two, your brain will leak out of your ears, pick four and you'll have the worst hangover of your brainlife". Our players loved making horrible things happen to themselves.</i><br/><br/>As he's slipping between the worlds, he has a vision: he sees a red brick house and a man approaching the house, wearing a white coat, like a professor would. He has a key and he uses the large copper key to open the door of the house and there's a small dog barking and whacking its tail. There's also a little girl and Nix hears the man tell them both how he loves them. Nix also sees that the dog will be squashed under a truck and the girl is hairless and will die to some horrible disease. The man puts the key under a stone and looks Nix straight in the eyes, like knowing his watching him doing that. Venom takes out one of the vaccines and hits the needle into Nix's heart, like adrenalin. As the antidote flows through his veins, he has another vision: Nix is tight into a chair and there's a man in a mask. He can see a lot of bodies and body parts all over the place. He sees the rest of us there too and the man in the mask is making horrible sucking noises. Suddenly Nix recognizes the man in the mask, it's Chain. <br/><br/><i>OMG CHAIN STILL HAS US! HE'S KEEPING US LOCKED IN THE DARKNESS AND HE'S... EATING US?</i><br/><br/>We're getting increasingly worried about what is going on here and we all feel time is of the essence here. So I look under the stone and find an old, green copper key. Another house emerges between the two we already saw there. It's a brick house that is completely burned, but somehow the door is still standing there and is shut. Crane puts his ear on the door and listens, channeling the Ghost Field. In a vision his head goes through the door and he sees a dog who's head is completely smashed by a truck and there's a hairless girl playing with a doll, but that he sees only as a shadow. He can feel a presence of a sea of souls. I use the key to the lock and open the door. I hear a bark and see the dog that is so broken that it shouldn't be able to walk, but walk it does. I see the girl and she's completely skinned and the doll is not a doll at all, it's her father's head she's playing with. My friends can see the dog and the girl getting inside me through my mouth and at the very moment I see a man who's making disgusting and horrible sucking noises and he has bloodsucker's teeth. Chain says to me: "Cable, get back to sleep, I have work to do on your body!" and I'm back at the front door. I now think that the girl and the dog were mine and even though I'm not the type to cry, I feel tears rolling down on my cheeks. "You may enter my house." says the head on the floor. So we do and feel thousands of Wraiths.<br/><br/>I tap into my new memories and the girl starts telling me things: she says there's a kitchen where daddy used to cook a lot of things. He used to brings people here and they went to the basement but never came back. I see that "Daddy" also used to bring body parts home. but. In the kitchen there's a copper knife "daddy" used to dissect the bodies he used to carve for her to consume, no matter what he did, she kept dropping her skin. At some point her brother left too, and never came back. Crane goes to the kitchen and there's a great basket with water and arms and legs are floating in it. There's an evil looking meat cleaver, Crane picks it up. He suddenly feels very powerful. As we walk toward the basement, he grins wickedly. He says the meat cleaver feels... nice. As we get down, we see a body with white gown, chemical substancies are going in and out of the place. The creature tries to stop us from entering, but Crane uses the meat cleaver to chop the thing in pieces. We see other body parts and a lot of blonde hair on the floor. Crane is laughing and chanting something weird. Crane suddenly wants to cut us into pieces, but I manage to stop him and take the meat cleaver from him. I feel the dark energies flowing from the knife, but the Wraith recognizes me because I have the girl and the dog as a permanent part of me now and the meat cleaver has no effect on me. <br/><br/><i>Ah, so absorbing Echoes isnt all bad?

I am in no pain, the creatures saliva seems to be anaesthetic. <br/><br/><i>In what was definitely the roll of the session, the GM says: "Roll two dice. One is to see if you can free yourself from the chair you tied to and act this round, the other to see how much of your body Chain has eaten." Wow, what a great roll. Results vary from losing a liter of blood to half your intestines.</i><br/><br/>I'm also not tied to the chair anymore, so I take a swing at the creature with the meat cleaver. He's hurt, but not badly. He says to me "Go back to your dream, or it will hurt!" I see that my artery is severed so I'm dying and don't have much time. Nix hasn't got his other foot anymore, but he still gets up and tries to get toward the creature. Venom's still tight to the chair, but she's mostly intact, only 1/2 liter of her blood is taken. Crane's a total mess: He's lost at least 5 meters of his intestines and all other body parts are in wrong places, majority of his body is totally messed up. Crane grabs Nix's foot and tries to stuff that into the creatures mouth. The creature has supernatural powers and is quite irritated, so he lifts Crane and crushes whatever there is left to be crushed in Crane's body. I try to cut him again with the meat cleaver, but miss and Chain crushes my remaining arm. Nix opens a portal to darkness I grab a lock of the girl's hair from Venom and show that to Chain. It turns out the girl was Chain's sister. Chain stops and suddenly the memories of everything rushes back to him: how he turned his back on everyone, how he left his sister. He sees how he turned into a monster that is cursed to consume living things. He cannot bare to re-live those experiences how he left everyone who ever loved him or who he loved, how he became the monster he is. Behind him we see a skinny, hairless arm with a hairless body getting out of the portal. That skinny arm starts dragging Chain down in the dark world. Chain hisses angrily and his mask breaks into thousands little pieces. As we see his face, we see that there's still a tiny part of him that is human. He gets dragged down and dies, but it is just, as he is a monster...<br/><br/><i>That's it! We debriefed for about half an hour. Everyone adored the dice mechanic and getting to 'choose your poison' and the evocative/inspiring setup of the game. Looking back at the setup, I realised we never gave our characters powers. We distinguished them from each other... Venom was a dealer, Cable a silent man with the reputuation of a killer, Nix a junkie, ... but we forgoed on having more superpowers than just being able to enter the ghost world. Some players jumped into the narrative input more, others seemed more drawn to the action, so that balanced out quite nicely as well. <br/><br/>Lovely game!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krak3n" title="Krak3n"><img alt="Krak3n" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nD1VZBIADW5BT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krak3n">Krak3n</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424012/#Comment_424012" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T01:46:42+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  1:46AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is crazy good stuff!<br/><br/>I make it a habit to NOT watch scary movies.

PC's are looking out the windows of the train and describing what the deathlands look like, and I just narrated a storm coming at them across the black ocean, and instead of hunkering down and trying to figure out what to do, the PC's are all, "Oh shit, it's a big one, tie yourself down!" and stuff. <br/><br/>It reminds me a lot of a therapy technique I learned for working with kids.  You start by drawing animals or other familiar shapes and letting the kid complete the drawing or talk about it, and after a while you start just making squiggles and letting the kid complete them -- like a Rohrschach test.   It's like that, I'm throwing out an ambigious image and the player's reactions help define it, giving me more to work with, and so on.  I also think it's a bit like improv, you have to listen very closely to what the other people are saying and go with it.  The genre expectations do really help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424706/#Comment_424706" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T19:11:46+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  7:11PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's cool.
