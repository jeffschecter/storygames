The original "theme plus choose 3 of 4" model is the best. Other additions tend to be a distraction. Also, picking a good theme and ingredients is really, really important: it can make or break Game Chef for that year.<br/><br/>2. Getting an "Endevour" forum on the Forge + Praxis is probably all we need, feedback wise (for now). People can organize other things on their own, if they like.<br/><br/>3. There is room for providing some up-front advice for how to get the most out of a week of design work.  I might write an article on this and link to it next year.<br/><br/>4. The "weekend + week + weekend" time limit is good. Lots of people need that second weekend.<br/><br/>5. It might be worthwhile to seriously consider a wordcount or page limit, like Little Game Chef.  I'm not sure how long yet.<br/><br/>6. Reading and commenting on 50+ games on my own takes at least a month. I need to consider other ways to cut down on that, but I really like being able to personally ensure that each game gets solid feedback, since -- if left to the masses -- sometimes individual designers get lost, confused, misdirected, or overwhelmed.<br/><br/>7. Players are good at self-organizing feedback groups, but it's not clear how useful they are. Maybe we could organize regional groups (Pac NW, New England, California, England, Nordia, etc.), where people could be more invested in their fellows, who live nearby? Perhaps these could also be used in the intial judging, with groups conducting "regional qualifiers" and submitting the 1-2 best games from their region?<br/><br/>8. The concept of the playoffs was cooler than the reality, I think, unless we can schedule it to coincide with one or more local meetups or conventions. "Never to Die" got a nice kickstart in playtesting from getting played three times in the same weekend at a local UK con.  I also really, really should have counted playtests during the design week and judging period as sessions, though that means I should also post all the reviews and finalists at the same time.<br/><br/>9. There should really be a thing where the judge(s) actually play the top handful of finalists, and ultimately choose the winners that way.  Choosing winners through play is definite the way to go (why else do you design games?!), whether that's in the form of this year's "playoff" structure or something different.<br/><br/>10. You cats sure can write some good games.<br/><br/>A couple other things I learned:<br/><br/>Here's the chart of website hits at gamechef.wordpress.com, sorted by week...<br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/gc-chart.png"/><br/><br/>The hits start coming the week I announced GC2010, peaked during the two weekends bookending the design period (the opening of the competition and then when the games were submitted) and then fell sharply each week afterward until they hovered around 500/wk, with one minor spike later on (I'm not sure what that was, maybe the initial posting of reviews?).  What this says, more clearly than ever, is that judging and naming the winner really needs to happen <b>as soon after the games are submitted as possible</b>, before everyone forgets what's going on.<br/><br/>Also, from reviewing the various submissions, aside from <b>a lot of really quality design work</b>, two particular issues stood out above all:<br/><br/>First, some folks had trouble nailing down their resolution mechanics in really concrete procedures. Under what circumstances do you roll dice? When, in the process of those circumstances unfolding, do you pause the fiction and roll? (IIEE issues). How do you read the results of the roll and incorporate it back into the fiction? What is the scope of what is allowed to be narrated during this incorporation? (Stakes). How do you make the traits that are invoked in resolution feel significant, meaningful, and consequential, rather than numbers and words that feel interchangeable with each other?  These issues suggest that <b>we need to talk seriously and in concrete terms about resolution.</b> Heck, we could even have a contest where you just design a resolution system and nothing else.  I think we have a tendency to treat these as fundamental things that are easy and straightforward.  They may be fundamental, but they can also be <i>really difficult</i>, especially when designers are attempting something unusual.<br/><br/>Second, in some of the games without a traditional GM role, designers went with mechanics that highlighted inter-player competition even when the premise of the game was more cooperative or exploratory. Also, <i>Polaris</i>-style distribution of responsibilities seemed pretty dominant in GM-less designs.  <i>Polaris</i> is certainly a modern classic, but -- combined with the first -- it suggests that <b>we need to talk seriously about different structures for GM-less play</b>. There's a lot of potential out there, but still only a few GM-less games have made it through to commercial publication and really gotten on folks' radar.  <i>Fiasco</i> is undoubtedly the biggest one recently, but a lot of others -- often with innovative responsibility distribution -- have either gotten less attention or never been finished (a lot of them have come out of Game Chef, actually). Consequently, it felt like some designers were struggling when the tools they were looking for were actually available, or at least previous attempts at them were, enough for them to build on.  I'm not really sure how best to make different GM-less techniques more accessible to folks, because sometimes it seems like -- as Emily wrote in her Push article -- that collaborative play generally happens on the level of individual playgroups, and that specific games are basically attempt to recreate other folks' home play environment.  But I'm not sure that doesn't apply to GM-ful play as well.  Guess we just have to publish more GM-less games or something <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Or maybe start some good discussions.<br/><br/>What did you learn?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305371/#Comment_305371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T09:29:58+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  9:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I learned that most of my productive designing time happens in the shower.<br/><br/>I learned that after the initial massive brain-dump, I need to write more often, in shorter bursts.<br/><br/>I learned that without actual playtesting with real people, economies are a pain to make feel right.<br/><br/>I learned that finding actual playtesters where I live is even harder than finding players for a regular game.<br/><br/>I learned that I can still latch onto little sparks of inspiration (a sketch of a map, an improv character warm-up exercise), and work them out into full-blown mechanics or other system bits.<br/><br/>I learned that making lists is really fun.

So there ended up being some games that were submitted that i had no idea were in development.  not a bad thing, but i would have loved to have watched them unfold and help with feedback if requested.  I think i'm also then saying that i miss the rss feeds from last year.<br/><br/><b>re 3 and 5:</b> I suggest that document formatting would definitely help take some of the x factor out of things.  If, for example, entries were standardized in Letter format with the type at 12 points and leading/spacing of 1.5, then it might take a huge amount of chatter about designing the look of the game and create more space for the making and playing of the game.  <br/><br/>As it is, making the quick draft version of the game look like a finished product is an absurd consideration for a fast contest.  It would remove the numerous discussions about "how" the game looks.  <br/><br/>As an example, i took a criticism (well deserved) for using too small type in my document.  I'd set my document up for printing aesthetics and for the way i proof work.  It would have been just as easy for me to set it up for web viewing but my head wasn't there.  My "pretty print" document didn't do any online readers any favors... and really, they were my audience.<br/><br/><b>re 6:</b> your comments were wonderful, but the extensive feedback seemed like a ton of voluntary work for 1 person to do in fairly short period of time.  I'd call it crazy but i don't know you that well.<br/><br/><b>re 9:</b> Could this be helped by extending the playoffs...  through New Year's or Dreamation or some such?  <br/><br/>...............<br/><br/>The competition part ran well. The time length was great.  Two weeks might have been nice.  Anything shorter than this would have caused me to not finish an entry.<br/><br/>The shorter competition length (over last year's) gave me far less time to read and participate in others' design discussions and requests.  I think i did an ok job of helping a handful of people but i would have liked to have done more.  As it ended up, I read about 1/2 or 3/4 of the final drafts and tried to submit notes where that was possible.<br/><br/>Further to that, It would have been great if more designers had included contact information and draft versions in their documents.  Because of the way entries were submitted, it was in a number of cases impossible to give the author feedback from a pdf link on the central site and not knowing which forum they were using for development.<br/><br/>I'd love to see feedback improved\u2014other than "finishing a concept", it's the most important part of the event to me\u2014 i'd even like to go so far as to make it necessary to qualifying as a finalist.  How would that happen?  Ooof\u2026  Support groups, or Comments counts in a designated forum, or Game Designers submit a list of 10 angels that contributed to their game?  Essentially, somehow monetize participation as a game within the competition, etc.<br/><br/>I learned that, for me, game design contests are a battle of expectations and deadlines.  Make tons of notes, shelve the darlings, (and as board gamers say all the time:) make a working prototype asap, aim for "done" at the 1/2 way point and use the addl time to adjust the existing document, and also that game design writing is nothing like literary writing.<br/><br/>And it can't be stated enough, but, thank you Mr. Walton for all the time and work you put into this event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305396/#Comment_305396" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T11:41:41+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 11:41AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I learned that my game ideas are usually too big to fit into a one week contest format.

Without some focusing mechanism I can't pay attention to everything, and that results in me paying attention to nothing. Despite my best intentions I didn't really follow anybody's development threads, there were just too many of them flooding the forums.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of splitting activity between Praxis and the Forge. I couldn't decide whether I should copy posts to both places, try to maintain independent threads, or focus on just one place.

More than that, i'd kill myself in overwork. (9 days)<br/><br/>I attempted to participate in a group, but i felt kind of ripped off in the end - it was mostly a timing thing, but i gave a lot of feedback to each, and received feedback from only one of my group-mates. Weird feelings. And then other folks who gave me good feedback and helped me out (Double King, Tomas, etc)... well, i didn't give them as much feedback as i would've liked, as that i was using that time already. <br/><br/>There could be a way to organize groups beforehand, maybe not regionally, maybe more like... stripe of game? Like, f'rex, me with my structured freeform, so-and-so with their crunchy grid-mapper: it wouldn't make a good match. I wouldn't know what to say in order to be helpful. "Design schools?"<br/><br/>It's counter-intuitive to me that we can play our own games in the playoffs. Which sounds snotty, though it's not meant to, and it's certainly not an attack on James or the other winners - Playing one's game a lot is totally dope, i play my own games too. But it makes one choose whether to play competitively or not... I'd rather have there be a system where we don't play our own games, and that there's maybe even another section before the playoffs where our hatch-mates or "Design school cohorts" play our games and give them actual play reports or something. <br/><br/>Also, next year i'll plan not to be moving into a new place during the playoffs, so that i can play the games that i'm most stoked on... two of the three of which didn't get played at all!<br/><br/>Those are my thoughts for now. Thanks, everyone and jonathan!<br/><br/><br/>Edited to add: i'd love to have a multi-tiered or somehow broken-up-into-sections playoffs. Yeah, that would be cool, would allow for more pomp surrounding the playoffs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305876/#Comment_305876" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T12:51:50+00:00" title="December 24, 2010 12:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a huge post and it was eaten. Poo!<br/><br/>1. Weekend-Week-Weekend is the perfect arrangement. Keep it!<br/><br/>2. Imposing a word limit is a wonderful idea. I propose 7-8k as the uppermost limit, and a suggestion of striving towards 4k.<br/><br/>3. You should stop structuring contests such that you need to read and review 40+ games. This is your second or third such contest, no? It burns you out and kills you, and always seems to intersect with other big life commitments. You need to design contests that take less work to complete!<br/><br/>4. Theme + 4 Ingredients is a wonderful structure. It's very important to get the right balance of ingredients, though. They should not fit together obviously and obtusely. I'm looking at 2009: Icon Intrigue as an example, here. Fleur-de-lis, Dividers, Seabirds, Stars. Well, three are about sea travel, and one is about France (and French nationalism). They don't combine in very many ways. Most of the game produced are about knights, seafaring, and zombies. This year ran dangerously close to the same problem, with a theme of journeying and 2-3 of the ingredients being locations. "Skin" was a saving grace. "Desert" also meaning "to abandon" was another saving grace.<br/><br/>It's important that the ingredients combine in non-obvious ways, and that there be room for lots of different clever discoveries when staring at the lists. The lists need to be diverse and disconnected. tentacles, aviation, boiling, fidelity. chamber, abyss, barter, spectrum. respect, horse, gutter, silence. thug, interfere, glass, magic.<br/><br/>So, I have an idea for Game Chef 2011.<br/>It would require, say, 5 judges. I volunteer to be one, and to recruit more.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2011: Champions<br/>1. There are 5 judges.<br/>2. Announce the Theme + 4 Ingredients. State a maximum wordcount: 8,000 words. Give 9 days.<br/>3. The submitted games are divided between the 5 judges (so, each judge probably has 8-14 games).<br/>4. Each judge reviews their batch, Walton-style. From their batch, each judge chooses 1 game to "champion."<br/>5. The 5 judges reveal their champions, and these 5 games are the finals entrants.<br/>6. Each judge reads each champion, and adds notes to the initial review. They also score each of the 5 champions on a scale of 0-10.<br/>7. One champion becomes the Grand Champion, based on scored reviews of the judges.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2011: Champions<br/>Side-Awards<br/>1. People can run Side-Awards. They don't need to be judges, necessarily.<br/>1a. Side-Awards are best announced around the same time the ingredients are revealed, either before or after. Announcing them too late would result in contest entrants not being able to design around them.<br/>1b. All Side-Awards must be announced before the end of the design period.<br/>1c. There would be a maximum number of Side-Awards. Possibly 8, say.<br/><br/>Examples of Side-Awards: Most Innovative Core Mechanic, Best Non-Standard Gender Depictions, Most Ewoks in Setting.<br/><br/>2. When entrants submit games, they can indicate "I think this game is eligible for Side-Awards A, B, C."<br/>3. When judges review games, they can verify those suggestions, and also mark any that the contest entrant missed. This is just a matter of looking at the Side-Awards list while reviewing the entry, and saying "Yes, nope, nope, nope, maybe, yep."<br/>4. The person who suggested the Side-Award is responsible for reviewing all the games eligible for the award, and picking one. Ideally, Side-Awards get announced around the same time that the Champions stuff is taking place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305879/#Comment_305879" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T14:12:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  2:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

A lot of the things that used to stymie conversations about resolution are now, in my opinion, solved. Which is not to say there aren't still a lot of exciting avenues to explore.<br/><br/>I think maybe we have less technology regarding assigning responsibilities in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305884/#Comment_305884" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T16:06:52+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  4:06PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, and I suspect a lot of folks in these parts, writing a game - and playing the game we designed - is its own reward.  What is really an effort is reading others' games, giving feedback, and playing others' games.  What about incenting the hard stuff? <br/><br/>Some ideas:<br/>* you can only enter a game if you play someone else's game (a bit like the Zoetrope writing workshop website...though since it takes 3-4 people to play a game there would still be games unplayed...)<br/>* prizes for most-games-played-that-aren't-yours;  most-games-given-feedback-on<br/><br/><br/>I wonder why we need a judge or judges to elect finalists - with the piles of feedback and history of play we should be able to choose which games we want to play even without the finalist / non finalist designation.  (Though I wasn't able to talk my group into playing any of the ones I wanted to.)  I suspect Never to Die would still have won...and I wouldn't have had to soak in my bitterness and resentment for not making finalist.

Poo!<br/><br/>1. Weekend-Week-Weekend is the perfect arrangement. Keep it!<br/><br/>2. Imposing a word limit is a wonderful idea. I propose 7-8k as the uppermost limit, and a suggestion of striving towards 4k.<br/><br/>3. You should stop structuring contests such that you need to read and review 40+ games. This is your second or third such contest, no? It burns you out and kills you, and always seems to intersect with other big life commitments. You need to design contests that take less work to complete!<br/><br/>4. Theme + 4 Ingredients is a wonderful structure. It's very important to get the right balance of ingredients, though. They should not fit together obviously and obtusely. I'm looking at 2009: Icon Intrigue as an example, here. Fleur-de-lis, Dividers, Seabirds, Stars. Well, three are about sea travel, and one is about France (and French nationalism). They don't combine in very many ways. Most of the game produced are about knights, seafaring, and zombies. This year ran dangerously close to the same problem, with a theme of journeying and 2-3 of the ingredients being locations. "Skin" was a saving grace. "Desert" also meaning "to abandon" was another saving grace.<br/><br/>It's important that the ingredients combine in non-obvious ways, and that there be room for lots of different clever discoveries when staring at the lists. The lists need to be diverse and disconnected. tentacles, aviation, boiling, fidelity. chamber, abyss, barter, spectrum. respect, horse, gutter, silence. thug, interfere, glass, magic.<br/><br/>So, I have an idea for Game Chef 2011.<br/>It would require, say, 5 judges. I volunteer to be one, and to recruit more.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2011: Champions<br/>1. There are 5 judges.<br/>2. Announce the Theme + 4 Ingredients. State a maximum wordcount: 8,000 words. Give 9 days.<br/>3. The submitted games are divided between the 5 judges (so, each judge probably has 8-14 games).<br/>4. Each judge reviews their batch, Walton-style. From their batch, each judge chooses 1 game to "champion."<br/>5. The 5 judges reveal their champions, and these 5 games are the finals entrants.<br/>6. Each judge reads each champion, and adds notes to the initial review. They also score each of the 5 champions on a scale of 0-10.<br/>7. One champion becomes the Grand Champion, based on scored reviews of the judges.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2011: Champions<br/>Side-Awards<br/>1. People can run Side-Awards. They don't need to be judges, necessarily.<br/>1a. Side-Awards are best announced around the same time the ingredients are revealed, either before or after. Announcing them too late would result in contest entrants not being able to design around them.<br/>1b. All Side-Awards must be announced before the end of the design period.<br/>1c. There would be a maximum number of Side-Awards. Possibly 8, say.<br/><br/>Examples of Side-Awards: Most Innovative Core Mechanic, Best Non-Standard Gender Depictions, Most Ewoks in Setting.<br/><br/>2. When entrants submit games, they can indicate "I think this game is eligible for Side-Awards A, B, C."<br/>3. When judges review games, they can verify those suggestions, and also mark any that the contest entrant missed. This is just a matter of looking at the Side-Awards list while reviewing the entry, and saying "Yes, nope, nope, nope, maybe, yep."<br/>4. The person who suggested the Side-Award is responsible for reviewing all the games eligible for the award, and picking one. Ideally, Side-Awards get announced around the same time that the Champions stuff is taking place.</blockquote>\nI second this post.  This seems like a significantly more sustainable approach and one which would benefit the participants more.   Realistically, it matters more that entrants receive prompt and constructive feedback rather then determining the objective winner of the contest.  I personally got so much more out of the lessons learned (define stakes in your resolution system) then out of the finalist list.<br/><br/>I personally lack the expertise to judge, but I would by happy to help the process in any way.   One of the potential elements of the contest which we may wish to incentivize is the contribution of feedback to other designs.  I tried to provide at least one constructive comment to each of the posts in the Forge and I think I may have fractionally helped those designs.  I would have benefited greatly if there were more bodies looking at my own thread and prodding it, so rewarding the givers of feedback seems like a wise course of action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305959/#Comment_305959" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T08:14:08+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  8:14AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking about it more last night - this probably not right for gamechef but the gamejam approach in videogames is cool: <br/>* hook up some collaborators<br/>* they iterate over their game over a short period of time: playing, tweaking, playing...<br/>It seems to me the approach should work well for story games.

Really, i'd rather people take their clever contest ideas and start their own small contests. Game Chef itself is somewhat overburdened as it is and having additional, smaller contests year-round would help allieve some of that pressure. I'm certainly planning on running smaller contests once I retire from running Game Chef, but I can't really "be the change" right now and need to count on other folks to do that. Little Game Chef and the contest idea Graham just started posting about are a good start.<br/><br/>Running small contests well is tricky, though, and I'd love to talk to interested folks about that, assuming anybody is interested. Folks like Andy, Graham, Jason MS and others also have good things to say about that, I bet.<br/><br/>Second, I tried really intentionally, both last year and this year, to resist the culture of design discussion and only semi-productive feedback that I felt was increasingly impeding (rather than assisting) actual design work and burdening the administration of Game Chef. I very much support Graham's effort to find a way to make feedback productive but, at least under my watch, Game Chef is going to follow roughly the same approach as the recent Forge reforms, deemphasizing feedback until a playable draft is written and encouraging playtesting instead. In my personal experience, building a design culture around seeking internet feedback can quickly become poisonous while building a design culture around play has always been much stronger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306288/#Comment_306288" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T19:36:25+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  7:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon,<br/>\nRE: Design discussion ... was increasingly impeding (rather than assisting) actual design work and burdening the administration of Game Chef.<br/>\nWell, the reality is, it is better to get a review before the contest is over (so you can adjust) than after.<br/>\nAnd, I do see your point, there is a lot of bad reviews flying around out there.<br/>\nBut, I don't think shutting down modes of discussion won't stop the bad stuff and will hurt the constructive feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it's your baby, so I beleaguer the point..<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306295/#Comment_306295" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T20:19:17+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  8:19PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I get what you're saying, but I guess I would like to view what gets produced during Game Chef as the very beginning of a process, with the feedback really happening after the contest.

It's too big of a subject to tackle in this thread post but there are a lot of people here that can help you with specific questions.  The Evil Hat people write about marketing, sales and distribution a lot.  Bohl, Crane, Sorenson, Morningstar, Solis, and Harper are all really strong about stumping for their games.  And John Stavropoulus (Jenskot) is a NYC area marketing professional that posts here and on other forums about tools and tips with regard to rpg and small publishing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306454/#Comment_306454" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T06:30:57+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  6:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I was judging games based on how playable the drafts were. Sometimes there's some overlap between games with decent layout and well organized texts, because part of layout is thinking clearly about how to present your information.<br/><br/>King, every effort I've seen to make Game Chef longer has just seemed to drag the contest out, with less and less involvement from participants over time.
