                            Penn State has a load of campuses, from what I remember.  State College has, what, like 20-30 K undergrads?  You ought to be able to put together a game for just about anything there, if you sell it right.                        </div>

I'm assuming you mean the State College area, namely University Park campus. Both myself and Bill White are in that area. Between the two of us we've been running a weekly indie demo/playtest at the GAPS (Gaming Association) late night saturday gaming at the student union building. There seems to be uncertainty about whether the open gaming will occur next semester, largely due to club and student government politics, but I expect the demos and some gaming to continue at worse. Also, Matt George, who occasionally has posted here, and is now helping me with RPG Theory Review lives in State College. <br/>
<br/>
As far as finding general RPGers, mailing-list style adverts tend to be largely hit or miss (outside of D&amp;D). I've developed a fairly diverse network of RPGers, from the larp community down to some RPGA groups. I can help track down people willing to try more experimental games, although I find it somewhat easier to bring people into the hobby from related organizations (SCA, harry potter fan club, etc.), than to compete for traditional RPGers with long running D&amp;D games. <br/>
<br/>
Also, Chad, I was informed about that offer when it happened. They seemed to think I was the only GM they knew willing to try a third-party playtest. I'm afraid I didn't end up following up, likely I was too busy, but I'm not sure why. GAPS has been much more about board games and CCGs, than it is about RPGs, usually supporting that solely by a mailing list and letting GMs reserve rooms in the union building. <br/>

Shockingly, nothing seems to have changed at PSU, vis-a-vis the "official" gaming scene in 13 years, then. I never really got involved with the gaming society when I was there because it was all D&amp;D and all Champions, all the time. I fell into a nice homebrew campaign and a good GURPS one with friends, and that did me pretty well.

Gotcha. Well, if there's any change in the interest level, drop me a line.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

Thanks, Mendel!<br/><br/>However, I doubt I'll have anything for "playtesting" at that point. . . but I do have several fine, published games ready for play. <br/><br/><img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>
