It's extremely evocative and the unconventional (especially at the time) rules mesh with so well with the feel he's going for. It changed the way I look at roleplaying, no matter what game I use. I lost track of the game for a while and found it again recently. I've also noticed it does get mentioned here, to my surprise.  <br/><br/>I've always wondered if Scott Knipe planned to continue working on it. IIRC, he seemed to allude a few times that he had refinements in mind. <br/><br/>Does anyone know?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94275/#Comment_94275" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T21:50:44+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  9:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

I know, because I'm actually Scott...name changes are confusing, I'll explain some other time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I did allude to fixing it several times.  I more or less know what those fixes would be even.  Frankly, my life is a mess right now.  Lack of energy and participation in the rpg community have forestalled any game design efforts on my part over the last couple years, but it could happen.  I'm not making any promises, but I also never say never.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Paul has prohibited me from launching new game design ideas at him until I finish at least one project on the table.  That more or less means WYRD, Kagematsu, or maybe something goofy, like Human Wreckage.  So maybe it will happen!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I'm glad it continues to garner a little attention here and there.  It's actually a fun,if imperfect, game just as it is, and I like that it's still floating around out there.  Your kid words are very much appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Corinne" title="Corinne"><img alt="Corinne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Corinne">Corinne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94281/#Comment_94281" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T22:02:03+00:00" title="September  9, 2007 10:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure Andy...<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20050405165452/www.actionroll.com/gildedmoose/pdfs/wyrd.pdf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94287/#Comment_94287" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T22:41:39+00:00" title="September  9, 2007 10:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Huh.

I liked that it was a very original game but never once did I get the impression it was simply for the sake of being original. <br/><br/>But for now, you certainly have my best wishes as far as taking care of real life first. Take care of yourself and thanks for the game, man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
