Josh Drobina chose The Witch (Vanessa), Kelly Vanda chose The Ghost (Katterina), Mark Causey chose The Chosen (Morgan), and I chose The Infernal (Harbinger). Sean Leventhal was the excellent MC. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the skins, The Witch and The Ghost are fairly self-explanatory (but no less interesting in execution), The Chosen is the Buffy/Slayer type of character and the Infernal is the person who\u2019s made bargains with and owes debts to a Dark Power. I love The Infernal so bad \u2013 such a gaming gold mine.<br/><br/>We filled out most of our playbooks (or whatever they\u2019re called in Monsterhearts), discussed the basics of characters, then did backstories which involved giving and gaining strings (bits of mechanical and narrative power) and other things to/on each other. This started tying us into each other\u2019s stories with small but very concrete details. <br/><br/>Then, on a whiteboard in the center of the table, drawn with a basic classroom set up, we chose where we sat during homeroom. I loved this. It instantly transported us to the hand-wringing of where to sit (and next to whom \u2013 some NPCs were on there too) and reminded us that as badass as monsters are, we\u2019re still just a bunch of teenagers who have to get to class on time and do homework.<br/><br/>Then Sean, the MC, asked us each some evocative questions. After each round of questions we had the chance to ask each other stuff too, for fun or clarification, and then we could say anything else we wanted to say. This was great. It wasn\u2019t that time consuming but it helped us understand each other\u2019s characters more completely and it set us up with enough fodder for multiple sessions, easily. We also turned the classroom drawing into a relationship map, which got complicated right away.<br/><br/>At this point, I\u2019m going to talk about some story AP and game playing stuff, focusing in on my character. Just to be clear, the other characters were important too, and were involved in other plots, but for the sake of brevity and clarity, I\u2019ll let the others chime in with stuff they liked on their own, if they want \u2013 they\u2019ll do a much better job.<br/><br/><b>The set up:</b> So Harbinger used to be a loser. Skinny, awkward, not much going for him. He fell hard for this girl Johanna, but she just wasn\u2019t interested. After one too many rejections and things otherwise not going well, he decided to end his miserable existence. So he cut open his arm. And as he was lying there, bleeding to death, he realized he wasn\u2019t that committed to suicide. But it was too late to do anything about it. So he pleaded with the Dark Power that was waiting for him. The Dark Power not only stopped up the blood but started fixing things for Harbinger. Sure, debts were racking up too, but that\u2019s a worry for tomorrow. Flashy new Mustang? Check. Hot bod to go with the renewed confidence? Check. Lot of sex? Check. Check. <br/><br/>The Ghost (Katterina) watched all of this with obsessive interest, but did not interfere. Yet. The Witch (Vanessa) proved to be a valuable ally in this time of change, but even she had her limits. And The Chosen? Morgan knew something was up with Harbinger and felt like he could save him from the Dark Power. (This is all the Backstory \u2013 strings given and strings gained part.) Except that Morgan also fell for Johanna and she fell for him in return. Morgan\u2019s allies, Fender and Lucy (both NPCs), became targets of Harbinger\u2019s lust and also a way for him to keep tabs on Morgan, and ultimately Johanna, his life\u2019s obsession.  <br/><br/><b>The questions:</b><br/>MC: Who beat you?<br/>Me/Harbinger: John (an NPC that had no tie-ins yet) \u2013 back when I was a loser.<br/>MC: Who do you beat? <br/>Me/Harbinger: Whoa. Fender (a dude).<br/>MC: Who do you sleep with?<br/>Me/Harbinger: Who *don\u2019t* I sleep with? Uh, Lucy and Fender. <br/><br/>That right there? That\u2019s how Harbinger became the villain of the first half of the session or so. Every other player had sudden fire in their eyes to protect Fender and teach Harbinger a lesson. I loved it! <br/><br/><b>AP:</b> In the opening Homeroom scene, Vanessa gets yelled at for being tardy, and Fender walks in with a bruised and cut face. Every one of us wants a piece of Fender at that point. It\u2019s not long before everyone finds out through Manipulating and Seducing Fender that Harbinger did it.<br/><br/>Later, in the cafeteria, Harbinger was hoping to speak to Fender, even apologize (\u201cwe were drunk, blah, blah blah\u2026\u201d), but there\u2019s this wall of protective friends sitting around Fender. I think that sent chills up my spine. Such a visceral scene. So Harbinger takes his lunch tray to sit by Lucy and they get cozy. Katterina is furious and she pours into Harbinger\u2019s head some haunting memories and feelings of pain, shame, and abuse, leaving him with the Condition: Blamed.<br/><br/>But the end of school, Harbinger\u2019s had a pretty shitty day. He still goes to wrestling, and in sparring practice, gets paired with Morgan, who\u2019s been wanting a piece of Harbinger all day. Morgan tries to overpower him, but the dice are not in his favor, so Harbinger, really pissed now, flips Morgan to the floor, badly wrenching Morgan\u2019s shoulder (Harm). Harbinger storms off to the locker room. Morgan goes to the hospital. And the coach calls Harbinger back in to berate him, giving him the Condition: Shamed (in front of the team). <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vanessa, finds out that Harbinger beat up Fender, so she gets a token from him (a cheap bottle opener) to hex Harbinger with illusions. So when Harbinger gets home to his milquetoast suburban house, he is greeted not by his parents (as far as he knows) but by utter blackness and two huge, demonic creatures that scream at him and call him worthless, pathetic, etc. on and on and on. (I think I did a few Hold My Ground rolls during all of these past scenes.) Crushed and desperate, Harbinger finally calls out to the Dark Power, who promises to give him Fender and make everyone else leave him alone\u2026if only Harbinger delivers Lucy to him. Suddenly Harbinger is back again in his own mundane living room, reeling on the carpet, with an address slip in his hand and the Condition: Terrified. (That\u2019s his third Condition in one day.)<br/><br/>The next day, still shaken, Harbinger keeps his head down until lunchtime. Fender is still surrounded by friends (minus Morgan, who\u2019s had an altercation in the spooky basement with the Principle, but that\u2019s his story) so Harbinger cozies up to Lucy again. He suggests that they go out later and have an adventure \u2013 do something different. Lucy is a bit hesitant so he eeks out a Manipulation. Now she\u2019s game, but wants some assurance first that things are ok between he and Fender (who\u2019s her friend too) \u2013 she\u2019s been hearing things.<br/><br/>So Harbinger sucks it up and sits himself next to Fender, who quickly edges away. With only moments to speak before all of Fender\u2019s protectors act further on their outrage, Harbinger looks at him with genuine contrition, \u201cFender, I am SO sorry! I fucked up really bad! Can we please talk about this later?\u201d Manipulation fails and everyone, including Lucy, is watching. Harbinger reaches out to the Dark Power again and learns that Fender is still really attracted to him. So Harbinger tries to Turn him On. Looking intensely into his eyes, \u201cPLEASE. I\u2019ll make it up to you later.\u201d You know, nudge, nudge.<br/><br/>It works! At this time, Fender falls on the floor convulsing with imagined creepy-crawlies on his skin. I believe this was a failed(?) Hex from Vanessa (who Seduced Fender earlier). Harbinger kneels by Fender and calls for help. Fender is taken to the hospital. <br/><br/>After school, Harbinger cleans up for his date. Makes sure he looks and smells good. Picks Lucy up in his Mustang. He\u2019s feeling pretty anxious and guilty about delivering Lucy, so he drives to a scenic location first and does everything he can to give her a good time. The thing is, The Infernal\u2019s sex move transfers a string of Dark Power debt from himself to his lover, so Lucy is now under the Dark Power\u2019s influence, just a bit. <br/><br/>(By the way, at various points throughout this, Katterina tries to Seduce Fender and fails; Morgan and Fender break out of the hospital; Katterina and Morgan sleep together; and Katterina hides Fender in a hole somewhere. I can\u2019t explain all of it well.)<br/><br/>Anyway, Lucy and Harbinger drive to the mysterious address. Turns out it\u2019s a seedy bar and strip club. At first Harbinger tries to make it sound fun, but Lucy\u2019s creeped out, \u201cLet\u2019s leave! Hey, my parents are away, we could go back to my place\u2026\u201d Harbinger\u2019s guilt is dialed up to 11 \u2013 and he really does like Lucy, so he puts the car in reverse and starts to leave. Except that the Dark Power isn\u2019t happy. Harbinger barely Holds Steady, and Lucy decides the club might be a fun new experience after all. She takes control of the wheel, causing a car accident.<br/><br/>She\u2019s unconscious and bleeding. Harbinger calls 911. Some big dude comes out and moves to drag Lucy into the club. Harbinger tries to stop him and gets pounded into the ground. Reeling, he just manages to answer his phone when it rings. It\u2019s Morgan! Harbinger clumsily explains that he needs to come help.  <br/><br/>Morgan eventually contacts Katterina and Vanessa as well and soon they\u2019re all on their way over in the decidedly uncool cars of their parents. But while this is happening, the police show up. Harbinger tries to explain that they need to find Lucy, but of course he\u2019s been drinking and his car is smashed up, so the police take him into custody. <br/><br/>The others show up, recognize the car, and storm the club. Morgan gets his second chance to beat up the baddies while Vanessa and Katterina find Lucy and take care of things on that end. <br/><br/>This is where we wrap up the session. The first thing Harbinger does upon getting out of jail is punch Fender in the face.<br/><br/>It felt like we could have gone on and on \u2013 there was so much good stuff going on and there was a lot we didn\u2019t get to. I would have loved to see what became of everyone and if Harbinger ended up more hero or more villain \u2013 he was definitely trying to walk the line, and, in this session was a villain. Probably just needed Morgan to save him. Heh. It definitely brought up interesting questions about abusing the abuser. <br/><br/>Also, we laughed SO hard during this session, among all the serious angst. There\u2019s something wonderfully grounding about playing a character with special abilities who is still just a teenager in a mundane world. Growing, leaning, changing. And who knew Fender would be such a big fucking deal?!<br/><br/>I ordered Monsterhearts as soon as I got back from Nerdly and hope to rope some people into playing an ongoing game soon.<br/><br/>(Oh, if you were in this game, feel free to add your own stories or fav moments.)<br/> <br/>-Rachel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379618/#Comment_379618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T02:34:06+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  2:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is such a mesmerising read Rachel!

Rachel told all the Harbinger stuff, but I'll try to bring in some of my favorite moments from the other characters.<br/><br/>First, Lucy and Fender were the Chosen's friends that he was supposed to be protecting.  Vanessa (the witch) also had a crush on Fender, and though things briefly went her way Harbinger eventually pulled him away.  To get revenge Vanessa cursed Fender.  This ended up with him in a mental hospital and Morgan trying to break him out.  Poor Morgan couldn't pass a roll the whole night ended up locked up in the mental hospital and eventually picked up by his mom when he got caught.<br/><br/>Katarina, the ghost, wanted to split Lucy away from the Chosen.  The basic plan was to show Lucy that Morgan was just as much a monster as everything he protected her from.  As an aside this was one of the coolest things about the way Morgan played the chosen.  The chosen was a monster of his own.  Anyway, Katarina sleeps with Morgan to get answers to questions about how to better manipulate him.  She tries to help Lucy in the strip club by taking her depression so she can stand up and move, but ends up engulfed in depression of her own.  Eventually Katarina gets free thanks to Vanessa and successfully splits Lucy, but only by manipulating Morgan into attacking her.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Morgan is storming the strip club/whorehouse that Harbinger had been delivering Lucy too, when he ends up in a fight with the demon/school principal.  After a continuation of his bad rolls Morgan is able to save Lucy, but only by losing an eye (and decent part of his face) all the while Katarina is successfully splitting Lucy away.  At the end Morgan has taken on a major sacrifice to protect Lucy, but Katarina has stolen her away nonetheless.<br/><br/>So much happened in this session.  We ran over by almost two hours due to my horrible pacing.  But it was totally worth it.  One of the most intense games I've ever run.  This is why Camp Nerdly is awesome.  So many fantastic players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley" title="pandajelley"><img alt="pandajelley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley">pandajelley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379626/#Comment_379626" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T05:24:50+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  5:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am about to talk too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my goodness, this game was incredible. Some things that I really liked:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Drawing a relationship map right over the homeroom map. This was a great visual aid for both the MC and us players to make sure lines were flying everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our Witch! The Witch shines best when played just as Josh played it - narcissistic and "invincible". Josh didn't play the passive bookworm, nor did he let fear of consequences stop him from Hexing everything that wasn't nailed down. It was amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our Infernal! Oh man. Rachel did such an incredible and subtle job portraying this young man just beginning to realize the threat and immensity of this power he's bargained with. He was villainous, but relatable and vulnerable. So good. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Our Chosen! I love that Morgan shunned destiny, that monster fighting was a way to let off steam. Mark drew heavily on the impulse to protect, but the emphasis was on those who mattered to him personally, not the world at large. He made this character that you could hate for being so imbued with violence, but you loved for his loyalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our MC! Sean was wicked in his hard choices, and pushed on the failed rolls. These are things I love to see in Monsterhearts, because the genre has the drama and angst cranked up to 11. And again, loved how he drew a relationship map over the homeroom. Totally stealing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Being a Ghost! The table let me ghost it up. Be "invisible", be vengeful, be a conniving bitch wrapped up in my own drama, including haunting visuals and creepy stalking. They even encouraged it. Thank you guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, this game had so much going on. There was virtually no "dead time". It ran over because there was always something else to do! I would love to have another ten hours with these characters. When I tell people about this game, I also like to mention Katterina's convoluted plan and how it freaking happened. Didn't think there was any way that we'd get to the end of it, but this game was moving so fast and hitting hard so it did! (Find out how to make Lucy hate Morgan thus ending their friendship and hurting Lucy who Katterina views as a victimization "enabler", seduce Morgan to ask him what he's most afraid of so as to best set him off, separate Fender/Lucy from Morgan, tell Morgan they're dead and sick him on a random thing, have Lucy see, chuckle evilly and fade into the background). Everything happened except for that last part, which is totally cool 'cause instead she got the shit beat out of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, thank you guys for being so awesome. I am now having withdrawals. Hope you're happy :D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379632/#Comment_379632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T06:31:57+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  6:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2012 6:32AM by Mark_Causey.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Esarel</cite>At the end Morgan has taken on a major sacrifice to protect Lucy, but Katarina has stolen her away nonetheless.</blockquote>\nBecause once Katterina figured out that Lucy would leave me if she saw me beat up Katterina, and Katterina revealed her ghost nature to me, shocking me into realizing that I'd ... well, fucked a monster, to be truthful.

Man, if something became of those two, that would be like the most screwed up relationship ever.

A couple things I particularly enjoyed:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a great moment toward the end of the session where Harbinger was fighting with his own conscience over giving Lucy to the Dark Power to get Fender, or losing Fender to save Lucy. It was great watching Rachel struggle with the decision herself, trying to figure out what Harbinger would do. Sean using the Dark Power's string on Lucy (gifted to her by having sex with Harbinger) was perfectly timed and dialed up the tension to a whole other level. I did not envy Rachel that choice!<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, Kelly as the ghost was creeeeeepy. Always turning up in unexpected/inappropriate places, asking probing questions and really getting under the skin of other characters. Vanessa and Katterina clicked on some level, I think because of their 'outsider' natures (not that the Chosen and Infernal weren't outsiders, but the Witch and Ghost I think were even further out). Plus Vanessa was the only one who knew what Katterina was at the beginning, and even had a sympathetic token relating to her death (a blood-crusted piece of rope).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked playing the Witch. The way I played meant that Vanessa was rarely the focus of the story, but instead was always lurking in the shadows, ready to make a bitchy comment, or hex someone to make them go crazy (Fender, Harbinger) or (in the case of poor Mr. Samson) end up in the hospital indefinitely in order to exact revenge for slights against her (imagined or otherwise). My favorite Vanessa moment was probably seducing Fender in the basement of the record store. Or maybe the moment shared with Katterina at the end where Vanessa realized that someone had just done something nice for her (the ghost healed some of her harm). Or maybe when she shut another NPC named Fred down when he was asking Fender questions about his bruises, cutting him off after every word he'd say, earning the condition 'Bitch.'<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to have more interaction with Morgan, but it just didn't happen in the story -- we were off in our own stories a bit, and Fender as the focus for all the PCs attention was working pretty well. I also wanted to put my Transgressive Magic to use more, but I only found a way to use it that didn't feel contrived or just too outrageous and improbable once.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou folks were awesome to game with -- this session was definitely the highlight (among many great games) of Camp Nerdly for me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379651/#Comment_379651" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T09:18:16+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  9:18AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is super awesome!
