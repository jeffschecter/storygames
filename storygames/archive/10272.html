He seemed astonished and asked me why I would not support the local gaming stores as they help keep the hobby thriving. I told him they had not done anything particularly to support my gaming other than want my money so there was no point when some one would support my gaming cheaper. In my opinion LGS\u2019s need to switch gears and focus on impulse or treadmill style games, and give people a reason to want to be in their store surrounded by awesome games. If there is not some special event, or space for me to play my games in the store than in my opinion the store is not doing anything to benefit the community except be a vendor who is not will to send my games to me cheaper.<br/>\n  I know my favorite LGS was the \u201cGamers Guild\u201d which boasted snacks 6 full size fold out tables tons of chairs and 3 4x8 wargame tables stocked with counters. Aside from that they had a photo copy machine and manila folder of any character sheets or play accessories to games they stocked (and some they didn\u2019t) that you could run a copy off for yourself. Sadly when I was still in high school the location they were at continued jacking their rent up until the older fellow who ran the store simply decided to retire and closed shop. When they were in business though I never bought anything online if they did not stock it I had them special order it for me and the play space was worth the extra cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am curious though what makes your LGS worthwhile to visit, or what would make it desirable to pay a bit of a higher price tag for?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228343/#Comment_228343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:18:18+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keeping the prices reasonable and the space clean and clean helps a lot. While online certainly gives a run for its money, for little things (a box of dice , a box of mini's , singles, etc) I really think a LGS is a lot more accessible and price competitive. <br/><br/>As for keeping my business, for the love of crap, if you dont have the space for play space, don't try to jam it in. Honestly there is one decent store out of three that really have the space for it, but 2/3 try it, and as much fun as it is , trying to slide past fat and smelly game nerds , i don't. I really think the whole 'lgs as community hub'  is something i never experianced or really want to. I have a social and events group in toronto for gaming (two actually) and I don't feel like I'm indebted to some creepy store owner guy (that's you harry tarantuala guy) or his pot smoking staff (ps that's a turn off too). PS also don't keep your pets in your goddamn store. Even for those of us without allergies, the smell and hair get everywhere, so gross.  <br/><br/>And the Harry Tarantualla really isn't that bad, especially the new location. <br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228345/#Comment_228345" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:27:07+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:27AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 7:28AM by Lord_Minx.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: OddsAre</cite>I am curious though what makes your LGS worthwhile to visit, or what would make it desirable to pay a bit of a higher price tag for?</blockquote>In my case, it's basically two, no, three things:<br/><br/>1. Instant Gratification is awesome. So if the price is acceptable, I don't mind paying a couple of euros more for the privilege of getting the game now.<br/>2. My the owner of my FLGS (<a href="http://planetharry.at" rel="nofollow">Planet Harry</a>, in case anybody cares.) is very interested in getting new stuff into the community (He's AFAIK the only FLGS in Vienna to stock Indie games.) and works pretty hard to do stuff for the community (For example, he's organized a gaming convention the last couple of years.) and I like supporting this enthusiasm.<br/>3. He's a nice guy and if it's in an acceptable price range, I will gladly pay a bit more to support local businesses I feel do a good job.<br/><br/>I don't buy everything there, but if I want something in print, he has it or is willing and able to get it for a good price, then I will buy it there before ordering it online and trusting the post office tp actually deliver it to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228347/#Comment_228347" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:33:21+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My FLGS stocks stuff I want to buy, including indie games (which aren't typically discounted online) and dice (which aren't typically sold direct through places like Amazon).

There used to be nice play spaces, couches arranged in 3's, and various dividing elements to keep noise down. Now it's a big, open space and there are long rows of tables for Magic tournaments. We used to play there, then buy product. Now its a poor space to play, so we don't go there. This is not an accident on the store;s part, but a studied choice. I know that Magic and other tournament games are more profitable than RPGs by a long shot, I've discussed the matter at length with one of the head guys at the store, and shifting away from RPGs has meant the difference between years of the store running in the red and now actually expanding. <br/><br/>So, I think the answer to the question is that our LGS's ought to be dropping our business like a bad habit. Every indie game and DnD supplement they stock is essentially wasted money compared to the faster-moving, higher-turnover products that they could be stocking, and getting more people to come in and buy a $10-$20 indie game has to be weighed against getting more people coming in and dropping $10-$20 on tournament entry fees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228371/#Comment_228371" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T09:09:11+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  9:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last several times I spent money at my game store it was because:<br/><br/>They're hosting a Race for the Galaxy Tournament and a bunch of us are going tomorrow (Blue Highway Games)<br/><br/>The owner kindly offered to buy some copies of my game and put them on the shelf, and gave me a great deal on in-store merchandise (Gamma Ray Games)<br/><br/>The owner regularly stocks IPR stuff, and I like to browse it in hard copy when I'm in the neigborhood (The Dreaming)<br/><br/>Had the urge to hang out with gamers and gossip about the industry for a few minutes (The Dreaming)<br/><br/>It in the mall where we were going to see a friend perform, and I needed dice (Uncle Games)<br/><br/>The store was brand new, and they sent me a discout coupon for the opening (Gamma Ray Games)<br/><br/>Strong desire for instant gratification (RE: Warhammer Fantasy Role Play) (The Dreaming)<br/><br/>Instant gratification (RE: Race for the Galaxy) (Uncle Games)<br/><br/>They donated an evening of in-store gaming to our charity auction and I bought it (Blue Highway)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228375/#Comment_228375" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T09:19:16+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  9:19AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 9:20AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since Eric and I frequented the same places (until I moved to Seattle), his experience mirrors mine.  Roleplaying games -- and indie games even more so, since they don't do the supplement treadmill thing -- aren't even as profitable as comics, which can be read quickly and in series, so you're constantly looking for new comics to read.  They aren't as pick-up-and-play as fancy board games and, from my understanding, offer much less profit per sale than board games do. Pretty much all the game stores I know are constantly in financial trouble of some kind, due to a mixture of bad business plans and selling low-income products to begin with.  The ones that aren't in trouble are moving lots of Magic cards.<br/><br/>That said, I don't understand why game stores don't create really nice play spaces and <i>charge people to use them</i>.  If people have to pay money to enter a Magic tournament, why shouldn't they pay money to play games in stores?  Seems like that's an easy way to get cash flow from RPGs and board games.  Personally, it was often the case that I wanted to support my FLGS, but they actually <i>didn't have anything that I wanted to buy for months at a time</i>.  So other than getting a cream soda from the fridge every now and again, they didn't get any of my money, even though we played games there all the time.<br/><br/>So, yeah, no game store in Boston really had my loyalty as much as they had my habit of going there.

Sometimes you get a nice chair, a room full of manga, and a soda fountain with free refills. Sometimes you get your own karaoke machine in a soundproof room. Anyway, it's such a standard business model that I have to imagine that it works well. After all, this is how Starbucks got so big - they were selling an 'experience,' with a certain kind of space and music and so on, and that was the core of their business model for years until people got used to paying their high prices for coffee.

They care about the big lines and keep them in stock (D&amp;D, Dark Heresy, a few other things). I buy D&amp;D books from them because they've got an excellent range of comics and I like having that accessible and close. They don't have play space, which bums me out.<br/><br/>My Not So LGS is sort of minis-focused; however, they have play space so I can run Living Forgotten Realms there and they're clean and well-lit. Being well-lit puts them ahead of the other comic book store nearby that has play space. I wouldn't bother with them otherwise; no indie games, and they don't stock a couple of the bigger publishers I'm interested in. But the play space is worth a lot to me.<br/><br/>Btw, said Boston store cleverly charges two bucks to each LFR player; said money goes to the GM as store credit, so when you have four tables of six players each in the store on Monday night, you know there's at least some revenue flowing into the coffers. Coulda been three bucks for two bucks worth of credit, but... the number of good businessmen who love gaming enough to run a store in a relatively non-lucrative business sector is very, very small.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228407/#Comment_228407" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T10:57:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 10:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>There's a certain business model that's pretty big in Japan, and I think I've heard of it in the U.S. also, where you have a nice space, an activity to do there, and you pay to use it.

However... I'd rather play at home.  Now, two apartments ago, I didn't really have the space and things were cramped and then I might have paid a little cash to play at a gaming lounge (although cash was also tight, then).  These days, though, I have a nice, big gaming table in a room big enough to hold it, and the games I play just aren't on store shelves (and there is a very good argument why they <em>shouldn't</em> be on store shelves, as Eric and Jonathan outline).<br/><br/>I haven't really had a "Favorite Local Game Store" since I was fourteen, and then I only really went there because it was a place to go, rather than a place I wanted to be.  You know, teenage years.  In college, I went to <a href="http://www.metro-entertainment.com/" rel="nofollow">Metro Entertainment</a> pretty often, but it seemed like every single time I went I was disappointed.  These days, the only reason I can think of to go find a game store is to buy dice.<br/><br/>Actually, not true -- NerdSoCal did some flash-mob gaming weekends at <a href="http://gameempirepasadena.com/" rel="nofollow">Game Empire</a>, which were fun while they lasted.  However, as attendance waned, setting aside half a weekend became a dubious proposition \u2014 not their fault, just schedule entropy.  Anyway, I usually browsed the shelves while we were there, and I think I bought something each time they hosted us, but I always bought board games or board game expansions.

Sometimes you get a nice chair, a room full of manga, and a soda fountain with free refills. Sometimes you get your own karaoke machine in a soundproof room. Anyway, it's such a standard business model that I have to imagine that it works well. After all, this is how Starbucks got so big - they were selling an 'experience,' with a certain kind of space and music and so on, and that was the core of their business model for years until people got used to paying their high prices for coffee. This is also how gym memberships work, right?</blockquote>\nIt really just depends on what the market will bear. Over in San Francisco's Japantown they tried to have a Japanese-style manga cafe, but it flopped and closed after a few months. I suspect that that's basically because here in the U.S. people who want to read manga without buying them just hang out in the manga aisle at the local Borders or download them off the internet, whereas in Japan reading stuff in bookstores is discouraged (and manga is typically shrinkwrapped), and online piracy isn't nearly as prevalent.<br/><br/>Likewise, for Japanese gamers, playing in someone's house is an order of magnitude more difficult for not only physical but social reasons, and on top of that the hobby scene is small enough that there's not a lot of specialized places to go. Instead, they tend to play in karaoke boxes, at family restaurants (diners, kind of along the lines of Denny's), and so on, and do so less frequently.<br/><br/>While it makes a certain amount of sense to offer a good play space and charge a modest fee for it, Americans have so many free options that it'd be damn hard to keep such a venture afloat. Listening to Chris Hanrahan (of Endgame) on podcasts, it seems that having play space benefits game stores in the long run by building a community around the store, and keeping regular customers coming back. I personally don't really use my FLGS' play space, but I know for a fact that with the RPGA and CCG stuff, there is a core community that does so very regularly. Some of those people no doubt still buy their D&amp;D books and such off of Amazon, but having that kind of constant foot traffic has to be worth something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228460/#Comment_228460" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T12:47:20+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 12:47PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>You're saying that the hobbyist community in the U.S. isn't full of people who live in small spaces, and might still be living with their parents well into their 20s?</blockquote>\nYes.

Unless they're really good friends, and even then, it can still feel "weird".  Instead, there's a HUGE and rich tradition of friends, coworkers, etc meeting in public to socialize, and it's so ingrained that it's pretty much first on folks' minds when they think of social meetups. It's only natural to meet up at the izakaya/tavern, kissaten/coffee house, or wander around the Old Town, or go to a restaurant and talk for hours, etc.<br/><br/>In Japan, I lived in the boonies, and still within 5 miles of at least 10 places where I could publicly meet friends and game until late at night almost any night:<br/>3 taverns (particularly "Don" in Isesaki)<br/>2 coffee houses (both "Himiko", an excellent palce with big tables, quiet/darkened seating and great food)<br/>At least 3 family restaurants, 2 of them open 24/7 (Gusto, Yumean)<br/>2 Karaoke parlors<br/>There are also 2 community centers, but I think both close at 8-9.<br/><br/>Compare that to where I live, one of the most cosmopolitan areas of one of the nation's oldest states: Within 5 miles of me... scratch that, within 20 miles of me, there is only one coffee house that is open past 9:00PM (It's a Grind), and a few Starbucks which close around 9. There are no family restaurants/24-hour diners (man, sometimes I miss New Jersey in that respect). There are no restaurants that are good for gaming. There's a community center in the next town over that's open later (9 to 10 or so), but they have no real good space for sitting/relaxing. Libraries close early and have no talking spaces. And the bars are loud and primarily stool-driven, not sit-down places of food and drink to spend hours. So again, just 1 public place within 20 miles of my house that I could comfortably game at.<br/><br/>In Japan, even mini-cons of 8-10-20 people tend to be held at reserved rooms at local hotels and stuff ("bring $5 please to pay costs", etc).<br/><br/>So yeah, aside from simple space issues, Doing Things With Friends Outside The House is just about as ingrained a social thing in Japan as the Take Off Your Shoes When You Enter a Home thing.<br/><br/><b>OK, Aside Over.</b><br/><br/>So, my local gaming store is also SciFi Genre in Durham (in fact, I might hit it up tonight, it's been a while). Honestly, though, I don't buy many RPG things from them: It just really never occurred to me to try ordering things I was going to purchase online anyway (IPR stuff, etc). Every once in a while I swing by for some nWoD books or dice/accessories. I primarily use them as my place to buy board games. That 20% discount keeps me going there rather than online stores. <br/><br/>I've never played/run an event there.<br/><br/>But thinking on it, aside from "convenience", and "inspiration; the ability to casually flip through Big Item games (big trad releases, etc) and look at them", there's not much draw for me. But that latter, the ability to put my hands on a book and see what it's like before I buy, is pretty much the only reason I even go to gaming stores these days. It's big for me.<br/><br/>Still, though, I'm trying to think of something where, if they had it, I'd totally come to the store more. What I'm thinking is "MORE gaming space", because most of the time, for area gaming stores, there's space, but not a lot of space, and there's usually already stuff happening in that space: I could just as easily go to It's A Grind with my friends, where we can game in a fun social atmosphere, undisturbed (the owner even goes out of his way to make sure we're happy and taken care of), where we can sit in comfortable chairs and drink/eat good food.<br/><br/>Maybe that's it: If the LGS made delicious coffee drinks and had some good food items, I'd use them more. As it is, it's always canned soda and junk food.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228465/#Comment_228465" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:03:04+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>While it makes a certain amount of sense to offer a good play space and charge a modest fee for it, Americans have so many free options that it'd be damn hard to keep such a venture afloat.</blockquote>\nRight, but by that same argument, people should still be paying $0.50 or $1.00 for coffee from pretty much any random place rather than three or four times that from Starbucks. Starbucks worked <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol144/starbucks.htm" rel="nofollow">due to their business model</a>, and that model was specifically not to convince people that their coffee was three or four times better than what you were getting at the time from Dunkin' Donuts. <br/><br/>Getting people to pay money for something that they were previously getting for free is a core business strategy, and there are success stories everywhere. You just have to be clever about it. Starbucks charged you a fee to use their nice space. It was bundled into the coffee. The FLGS model is to bundle it into... what? Well, the economically viable answer is manifestly not indie RPGs, or even RPG books in general. And the spaces aren't even that nice. How many LGSs have you been in with spaces nice enough to be a restaurant? How about nice enough to be a grungy college coffee shop? I've never even seen one that looked as good as an activity room in a retirement home.<br/><br/>Putting out tables to play your DnD games at might build a community, but that means jack all if it doesn't keep the business in the black. A very small minority of stores seem to pull it off, but I've never seen anyone pull that off well enough to fuel sustained expansion. It always seems to be a labor of love, with owners and employees working long hours without overtime and such.<br/><br/>There's a better business model here. Making a nice social gathering space, making a genuine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Place" rel="nofollow">third place</a> around gaming, and then making a business model out of that. It's worked elsewhere in the U.S. for other industries, provided they were clever enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228474/#Comment_228474" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:17:47+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 1:18PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I lived in Boston (and now, where I'm living in Seattle), most of the 20-30yo folks I know are living in group housing in one of the various student housing ghettos, either with a few friends / craigslist housemates -- many of whom are not gamer types -- or with their live-in significant other -- also often not a gamer.  Consequently, when you're splitting a small 3-5 room apartment with some other folks, finding a place to play regularly is a pain in the ass.  In Seattle, Harper's groups sometimes play in his office after hours because there aren't other convenient places to play. So my experience is very, very different from a lot of folks here.  I would gladly pay $5-10 an evening (per person) for a good place to play.  If they served coffee/tea and/or beer that would be even better.  The only people I know who wouldn't be excited about such places are those who have specifically arranged their lives so that they live in a house that is entirely full of gamers, but I just can't bring myself to do that.  I want to have other things going on in my life as well.<br/><br/>P.S.

There are dozens and dozens of places around you in Durham with rich traditions of social gathering, group activity, and community building, all fueling a business model that has successfully persisted for as long as Durham has existed. They're called churches. Your fellow hobbyists might not be willing to go gaming at the local restaurants, but I bet a fair number of them go to church. And a good chunk of those that go to church also attend church-related activities. You've also got dozens of mom-and-pop BBQ places, and those also have a rich history of local community. Bullock's has been serving up BBQ in Durham since 1943, same family and same building, with a strong local following and community (to pick a random example). It's right there all around you. It clearly works. It's sustainable and strong. The challenge is how to make it work for gaming. <br/><br/>Pandemonium in Boston is having strong success building a third space around Magic. I see a large cohort of regular players in there all the time. It's working right here for that game. It requires lots of skills and effort, but it works. Why can't it work for RPGs? (Pandy's tried and eventually said 'fuck that shit'.) Geek fallacies aside, we are still social organisms.<br/><br/>edit: I quoted the wrong bit of Andy's post. I meant to reference the "Americans do <i>this</i>, the Japanese do <i>that</i> bit, because that bit focuses narrowly on particularities to the exclusion of the underlying commonality. <br/><br/>The bit I actually did quote, however, screams 'underserved market' to me. I went to High School in a little town where the only places open after 9:00 were bars and truck stops. After I graduated, some guy opened up a little place where high school bands could play shows for their friends.

The way this works in other industries is to make a place people want to be in, with food and drink and everything else, and then build in an activity set - even listening to music from the CDs that you can buy at the front - and you rake in the cash. I've seen this work in Minneapolis based around LAN parties. Clean, shiny, new space, great chairs, big-screen TV with consoles, top-of-the-line computers, good (if not great) food and drink. You wanted to be in there just because it was a fun place. They made mad cash.

It's clean, it's well-lit, it has reasonable prices (possibly with a regular discount or good, frequent sales), and it's convenient (either close to home or close to my route to/from work).  The staff are polite, the store is either quiet or plays music that I don't hate, and it's easy for me to visit when there's not a crowd.  And of all these preferences, probably the most important is price.<br/><br/>I really do like brick-and-mortar stores a lot, just for the browsing factor.  Being able to pick up a book I haven't heard of and flip through it beats the shit out of things like online reviews and Amazon's dorky "other people bought this" recommendations...but being able to buy most books cheaper online tends to skew my purchasing behavior these days: the books I look forward to and plan on getting are the ones I order online, while the things I'd buy at a LGS are impulse purchases (taking advantage of a sale, seeing something unexpected that I want to own RIGHT NOW, emergency replacement dice for tonight's game, etc.).<br/><br/><br/>Things that don't get me to shop at a LGS are a few of the things mentioned as draws for other people.  I don't care if they have gaming events or gaming space, because I don't want to game there.  I don't care if they promote local conventions, because I don't go to cons.  I don't care if they "promote a gaming community" or serve food and drink, because all I want is to get my shopping done and get the fuck out.  I don't mind if the LGS does all of those things, and if it helps them stay in business, more power to them: it's just not something that matters to me and it won't influence my decision to shop there.  (I wouldn't shop there when they're hosting some event, but them hosting events wouldn't make me swear off their store forever.)<br/><br/>Basically, I want to treat my LGS like I treat my grocery store: I stop by, look through the aisles, buy what I want, and go home to enjoy it.

The ones that don't have either flopped, or have stayed in business by being comic book stores that happen to stock some games. If the community isn't buying stuff then they won't be helping the store much, but I don't see why we'd expect people to come into a game store regularly to play games and not buy anything.

But you have to spend the credit that night or lose it, which means add on a few bucks per GM since they're rarely spending exactly $12.

They'd be more than happy to have people come and play RPGs, and they're open until 3 AM. They stay solvent by being adjacent to the largest public college in the US, and through food, drinks, and the largest Sanrio gift shop in the US. So for you midwestern types, check it out. It's an awesome atmosphere.<br/><br/>There are two LGS around here: Modern Myths and Greenfield Games. In general, the folks in Western Massive support them because they support us. They sponsor JiffyCon financially, stock our games, play them at cons. They support us because, especially in Greenfield, this is a small area with people who don't like big-box stores or going too far for what they want. The closest Target or mini-mall-type place is a half-hour away at the least, so Greenfield Games is the only place to buy Clue, let alone Power Grid or Poison'd. They support indie games because it's the indie gamers around here that keep the hobby in the spotlight-- we throw cons multiple times a year, and are always in the newspaper when it happens, along with the names of our sponsors. Because we run indie games, people who attend our cons leave wanting to buy indie games, which might introduce them to a new store where they can also go later to get the higher turnover, higher-profit stuff as well. I think major metropolitan areas, with your Targets and your malls and your large number of comic and game shops, don't have to cultivate new customers in the same way.

Your personal efforts to avoid the tragedy of the commons are noble in a fashion, but those efforts wouldn't be needed if they had a business model that got Denys to drop a ten-spot every time he wandered on through. As far as he's concerned, the only added value that the store brings is physical proximity to the product. That's a pretty thin proposition when weighed against a $10 or $12 markup. You need him to drop $10 on just being there for the fun of it, and then maybe you move product for extra profit or maybe he pulls out his smartphone and meh, you got his $10 already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228538/#Comment_228538" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T21:32:53+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  9:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ever since I've left Pittsburgh, I've missed Phantom of the Attic, on Craig Street in North Oakland.

Most of the games I buy are in pdf form, and even when they aren't, buying online gives me my game quicker usually. 1-2 days delivery time if ordered within the UK whereas I might have to wait all the way to the weekend to go to the shop - noooo!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm puzzled: why <i>should</i> I support my FLGS (if I had one)? When internet vendors are doing a better job of selling the games I'm interested in, and doing so in greater numbers?

And more serious hobbyists, the ones more likely to spend serious money over the course of a year, are more likely to want to bargain-hunt than a dilettante like myself, and are the customers the local store will suffer the most from losing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228607/#Comment_228607" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T14:34:16+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  2:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 2:34PM by Ron Hammack.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>According to a Gallup poll, 53% of the adults in North Carolina attend church on a weekly basis, so I was playing the odds.

I drove to another game store in town today just to check it out and see if they had a different selection. I saw a game (Burning Empires) I wanted to buy, but knew that Guardian had it as well, so I just drove to Guardian and bought it. I also ordered Sweet Agatha from them rather than to go home and do it from IPR.

There probably isn't a lot of crossover (ha) in the populations.  But I would guess that there are probably one or  two other gamers there but I haven't found them.  Yet.  Would we play at church?  No.  Not for rpg's.  I will agree that there is a cloud over the whole 'role playing game' industry/genre as legacy of the past.  I know people who still believe it.  And I do not want to offend or cause a problem for me or the genre.  So we play at home.  Which is probably more comfortable anyway.  My group is a group of pioneers then.

Their staff is friendly and their selection of indie games is also pretty strong.<br><br/>I also shop at Gamma Ray Games in Seattle because it's hyperlocal.  It's about 200' from my tiny inner-city apartment.  I stop in about once a month, around the time the new D&amp;D product drops.  One of these days I have to take the old figures in and see if I can get the seed of a great single-fig display case going there.<br/><br/>I don't generally shop online because my tiny apartment is not online-retailer friendly (USPS sometimes drops stuff off in the foyer, sometimes drops stuff off at my door, sometimes they leave me a little card telling them to visit them, which is more of a pain than just buying the stuff at an LGS.)  Before Gamma Ray appeared I was buying D&amp;D books at Borders, which is hyperlocal to my dayjob. <br/><br/>So, for me: hyperlocality wins, unless you have a bitchin' figures case.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229230/#Comment_229230" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:25:39+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is very interesting to hear, by reflection, how awesome Sci Fi Genre actually IS.<br/><br/>"Online is cheaper": I am about to buy both <i>Mouse Guard</i> and <i>Are You The Traitor</i> from SFG. And both will be 20% cheaper than anyone else selling them (as I won't have to pay shipping).<br/><br/>"Just throwing out tables doesn't make community": SFG has events every night of the week though, admittedly, some of them "open" events (i.e. do anything--an almost non-event) and some don't get any real interest. On top of that, they have loaners/demo copies for just about everything that's new or hot. PLUS, they have a TON of miniatures terrain and buildings so that mini (and Clix and even RPG) gamers can make use of it--this would, I feel, be a key lynch pin for those "lifelong" hobbyists, so that they can have a fresh battlefield without spending on flocking and so-forth.<br/><br/>"Unfriendly": Not likely. You want unfriendly, go to the new comic shop of 9th Street! But SFG always has helpful and smiling folks (barring MAYBE one guy who I haven't seen there in a while). Great email support, too, as I discovered recently while dealing with confusion over their "pre-order" status for Mouse Guard (should be "special order" maybe). And being themselves gamers, they can relate to a variety of niche, geeky stuff without (obvious) judgment (unlike dour comic store guy on 9th).<br/><br/>"Comic shop with just some games": They DEFINITELY are a comic shop. And a LOT of board games and a surprising amount of mini support. Some manga, some anime, some toys/dolls. If they sold R/C stuff, they'd probably corner the market in Durham for that, too.<br/><br/>So it would seem that these things make success:<br/>* Internet AND brick-and-morter, with Internet prices for in-store pick-ups.<br/>* Usable play space with a value add (in this case, the terrain and loaner stuff).<br/>* Courteous and at least somewhat knowledgeable staff (duh).<br/>* Diversity of products for a variety of age ranges and both genders.<br/>* Willingness and ability to order ANYTHING someone is seeking and to do it right the first time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231646/#Comment_231646" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:34:23+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:34AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am lucky enough to live near <a href="http://endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">EndGame in Oakland, CA</a>, and they have continued to work hard for the gaming dollars I spend there.<br/><br/>The people who work there are all partners in the business, so no bored Firefly fanboy turning up his nose at you for asking about Warhammer. Each of them specializes in something, but they all know a little something about the things in their store.<br/><br/>Besides the great people who work there, they have an amazingly well-designed gaming space upstairs that is open to the rest of the store. There are two sections connected by a catwalk; one with 6-7 tables for RPG/board/card games, and another with 5 big minis tables and another table or two for painting minis or gaming overflow.<br/><br/>They really do put themselves out there as a third space, and they hold a diverse set of gaming events. Both weekly like board game night and W40k night, as well as four rpg minicons a year (which get a lot of indie love). Their indie shelf space is always well-stocked.<br/><br/>I don't go there very often when I'm not playing, but on average I play there about every two weeks. And even though the space is free, I generally end up buying something, whether an indie RPG or (more likely) board game. I game at my home or someone else's occasionally. But honestly, EndGame is so welcoming and their play space so comfortable that it's like a second family room to me. It's funny to see "non-gamer" adults browsing the shelves downstairs and ending upstairs to look at the games being played. They usually have a look like "wow, this doesn't look so bad". I can't imagine someone walking into one of those dreaded gaming "basements" they had at the hobby stores of my youth.<br/><br/>The staff is the complete opposite of another Oakland game store than actually said on their website "If you bought it on the internet, go play it on the internet". Chris Hanrahan has become used to me asking for a table for 4-5 hours to playtest various games than may never even make it his store shelves. But he always says "yes" because he is far-sighted enough to know that I'll be bringing people with me who he has the chance to earn the loyalty of. Oh, and hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of minis terrain and terrain boards to use for free when I'm getting my LOTW on. How do you say no to that?<br/><br/>I still buy some of my games on the internet, mostly from IPR or pre-orders I can't say no to, but I spend 90% of my offline dollars there. Happily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231676/#Comment_231676" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T10:15:05+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Endgame looks like it rocks hard.

Don't really need more. (Heretical, I know).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, I don't think they're doing anything wrong. It's just that, while I still <em>play</em> games regularly, I just don't buy much anymore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10272/how-does-your-lgs-s-earn-your-business" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10272/how-does-your-lgs-s-earn-your-business" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10272/how-does-your-lgs-s-earn-your-business/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10272%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10272%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
