                    I thought that while we were in the peacefull lull after Iron Game Chef,  I would make some stone soup for Y'all.  I tell you this stone soup is going to be mighty tasty. Some of the best stone soup you ever had. Of course, it might be that it needs a little Setting.<br/><br/>Has anybody got a setting that they started to work up that they wern't using that I could throw in the soup? Nothin' too big I just need it for a little flavor. The soup would be fine without it really but some nice setting would help a litlle.                </div>

The men's names were: Flash of Insight, Strike of Lightning, Emporer of the North, Emporer of the South, Humility before God, I Know It That I Know It, and Old Noodles.<br/>

                            Oh! That is a lovely little bit of setting it will go nicely with the stones. does anyone else have a bit of setting to thicken it up with. anything you weren't using of course, I would never want to take anything you were using. Maybe some old setting from a game that never got finished, or something you heard about and wanted to put into a game but never found the place. or a feature from some old D20 game you've been hanmging onto with no good reason.<br/><br/>See how good Humility before God and dumpling make the soup smell?                        </div>

                            Have at:<br/>
<br/>
	There were, as normal, thirteen of them, hooded and cowled and drawn together on a cold, foggy night to a meeting place with little to no character, the less to remember and store away in the mind, tidbit clues to endanger its secrecy.  The damp air and the voluminous robes stole all sound from the scene, and as the candles were lit, touching one wick to the next in slow succession around the circle, they became the only light.  Soon the world was only thirteen hooded figures, thirteen candles, and a fog which haunted the fringes of their reality.<br/>
	Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have found him.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The voice presumably came from one of the figures, but such was the scene, so deep the cowls and so dim the candles, that which one had spoken was indeterminate.<br/>
	Ã¢â‚¬Å“It has taken a great deal of time,Ã¢â‚¬Â came the dubious reply, equally as anonymous.<br/>
	There was a pause, as if the first voice feared to speak.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was well hidden.Ã¢â‚¬Â  It might have been the first speaker, it might have been a third.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The resources of the Crown disguised him and hid him.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>
	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then he will not expect to be found,Ã¢â‚¬Â said another, and this time the cowls twitched, almost turning to face the source, a voice in no way dissimilar from the others, but nonetheless carrying more weight in each word than the others might invest in a line.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We work in shadows he cannot pierce and patterns he cannot discern.  He will be in our hands soon.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>
	The circle stilled after the pronouncement palpable with eldritch power.  Finally, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What disguise has he been hiding under?  He was in London?Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>
	Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no better place to hide than London,Ã¢â‚¬Â another voice concurred.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He styles himself a playwright.  His name is now William Shakespeare.Ã¢â‚¬Â                        </div>

                            I bought like 24 of those Crystal Caste d4s the other day, y'know the ones that don't look like caltrops?  I was going to use them for Dogs Fallout, but it's gonna be a bit before I play that again.  Here, I'll throw them into the pot.  24 d4s. Kerplunk.<br/><br/>Someone want to take the spoon, mix it up and see how these d4s will affect the taste of the soup?<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, here, I had these sitting around, as well:<br/>Kerplunk, kerplunk, kerplunk, keplunk.  They are excess East, North, West, South tiles (one of each) from a Mahjongg game I had here. I don't know if they'll just sit at the bottom and won't mix well or be eaten, but there they are.                        </div>

                            This Mr. Shakespear or whatever IT is going by this time, doesn't that provide a smokey overtone. What could go well with this cabal of old people?<br/><br/>24 D4s that's sure going to make it spicey. I was hoping for a little more setting, but not to fear there are many wonderful things go into a soup and your D4s are certainly welcome. Does anyone have an old mechanic that uses so many D4s? Think of how a mechanic might give each bite of soup a little bit of crunch?<br/><br/>Thank you both                        </div>

<p>I received an anonymous letter in the mail, containing a $2 bill and this game mechanic.</p>
<p><em>Casting a Net:</em> Whenever you try to invoke a Net, roll all the d4s in your Pool, and arrange all of them on the table so that none of them touch each other. Each player will take turns choosing an action from below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pick a thread:</em> Remove a dice of a given number; then take all solitary dice on the table that match that numbers. Move them to the side of the table and put them touching each other, so that they form a single, contiguous line. This line now is acted upon on its own. You must bring an Story Element into play to do this.</li>
<li><em>Fray a thread:</em> Pick a thread of dice up from the table, and reroll them all back onto the table. They are now all considered solitary dice again. You must bring a Chaotic Element into play to do this.</li>
<li><em>Snip a thread:</em> Take a thread of dice, and split it into two smaller subthreads. You must bring a Complication into play to do this.</li>
<li><em>Stitch a thread:</em> Take two threads of dice of the same number, and join them into one. You must bring a Boon into play to do this.</li>
<li><em>Declare the Net Complete:</em> This phase is over, and now the Net is ready used in the next phase. (No more actions may be taken.) You must spend a Fate Token in order to do this.</li>
</ul>

                            Here's a scribble I found on a newspaper in the recycling basket at a cafe:<br/>
<br/>
When a player asserts his character by bringing one of their core traits into play, he takes a stone, and he puts another stone in the pot.<br/>
<br/>
When a player establishes some conflict between his character and the character of another player, they split the pot.  The player who starts the conflict takes the least number of stones such that he gets more than the other player - in other words, if the pot has an odd number of stones, the conflict-starter gets the odd stone.  If the pot is even, the starter takes two stones, and then they split the pot.                        </div>

That way it will come out more like character descriptors. <br/><br/>Judson - Keep looking in the trash this is better stuff than some people eat in diners (and less greasy) I think that your mechainc will go well with those D4 Poppers.<br/><br/>I understand that you people round here like the taste of constraint.

                            When I was little I had a reoccurring dream:<br/>
<br/>
It all started behind the daycare center...  We were learning how to garden and as I was digging, my shovel hit something wooden, and everyone around me disappeared. I didn't worry about it and kept digging anyway.  Soon, I uncovered a coffin. A coffin that seemed to me and my small youthful size to be huge.  It was much larger than a coffin for someone the size of my grandfathers, and he was the biggest person I knew.<br/>
Soon, I uncovered I pried open the coffin and as I opened it I heard noises.  Not the kind of noises that you'd expect to come from coffins.  Not the rotting of flesh and crawling of bugs and not the moans of a mummy or a vampire, but the sounds of the jungle.  As I opened the coffin further, a breath of hot humid air touched my face, so I threw open the coffin and peered in, and next thing I knew, I was sucked into the coffin.<br/>
All around me was a dark forest that seemed to float on water, and when I looked up I could see the ground which was now a ceiling.  It was misty and dark and the only light I could see was from an old pure white paddleboat with steam pouring from its smokestacks.  The boat had three floors, and on the top, it was open to the world.  People where dancing, gambling, smoking Cuban cigars, and laughter filled the air.  Then I noticed I was at a dock.                        </div>

Color adds so much to a soup don't you think.<br/><br/>The soup is coming together very nicely; it needs a bit of a simmer and we could still use some more constrains or rewards. I'm sure I could make due with the bits we have but a nice reward system would really give it some zing.<br/><br/>Another thing that would help with the presentation would be some images. Evocative people or places allways saves one a thousand words or so.                        </div>

                            The soup is getting a little cold I need some actions to warm it up. I need some actions that a player would like their character to do and the levels of pain that would stop you from doing them; Assume that the pain goes from 1 to 6 with one being low pain and 6 being the worst.<br/><br/>The pain is from your cancer ( whatever form that takes) the more cancer you have the greater your power in one realm of the game but the lower your abilities in the Physical. <br/><br/>We are definitely using the nets to make the biggest part of the story, the Old men and women as archetypes ( which will act as modifiers to actions in concert with their wishes) <br/><br/>What sort of things come in Fives and Sevens? these will be things which you can associate in narration to improve your chances of success. <br/><br/>The characters will  be people with a Cancer of some sort that seperates them from society they will all have a Father from the Men and a Mother from the Women these will be metaphorical like zodiac signs but will affect what things the characters the chartacters will get bonuses for doing. <br/><br/>I Need some archetypes for the Old Men and Women any body got some archetypes around. <br/><br/>Don't give up on me yet the soup is coming together we need to blend the seasonings a bit and find the meat and we will be there.                        </div>

                            Bryan, Mon Ami! That is incredible. Exactly what I was envisioning. I will have to write rules for giant robots just for that. That is so excellent . <br/><br/>Sorry gushing not good form in the stone soup biz. <br/><br/>Has anyone got some robot stuff they weren't using?                        </div>
