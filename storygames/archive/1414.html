                    I have this problem.  <em>Everything</em> relates to my current project recently.  I feel like I'm running at the mouth.  If you're tired of hearing me babble about <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>, man, I totally understand.  But I'm going to babble about FLFS now.<br/><br/>So in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1392&amp;page=2#Item_5" rel="nofollow">Scenes without goals and conflicts</a>, we were throwing the word 'conflict' around a lot and it became clear that we were talking about different things with the same word.  Short version: some folks were talking about <em>engaging the conflict resolution mechanic</em>, some people were talking about <em>conflicts of interest between players</em>, and some folks were talking about <em>the literary criticism definition of 'conflict'</em> (that being character+desire+obstacle).  And it occured to me that <em>FLFS</em> uses all three of those in relatively discrete procedures and might present a worthwhile example.<br/><br/>You roll dice in <em>FLFS</em> for two reasons.  The first is to charge up your thematic battery.  Basically, at any point in the game you can call for a roll for your own character and give yourself a disadvantage in line with your thematic battery (I'm a <em>Rake</em>, therefore I show up to my post hungover from the night before).  You set stakes and stuff, roll, and stuff happens and it's likely that stuff happens poorly for you since you're at a disadvantage (I bang up the lander's hull trying to dock while hung over -- whoopsie).  This is <strong>engaging the conflict resolution system</strong> but it is not trying to define the scene in terms of "the conflict".  It's pure character exposition.  (It is setting up the character for reincorporation later, though.  We'll get to that soon.)<br/><br/>The second reason to roll dice, though, is to contest control of the narration.  Basically, Judson is narrating that he takes control of the situation because he's just a badass like that, and I tell him "hell no, roll dice to back that shit up."  He rolls his Leadership and Empathy or whatever's appropriate and if he wins, what he said comes to pass and he keeps going, and if he loses, he fumbles in some way and I tell him how it happens and take up the reins of narration.  Alternately, I can jump in and roll myself for some other, totally disconnected thing that I might be doing in the same scene, and if I make my roll, whatever that is, I narrate my success <em>and keep going</em>.  Narration is mine, now.  So these die checks -- <strong>engaging the conflict resolution system</strong> -- are a relatively pure expression of <strong>conflicts of interests</strong> between players at the table.<br/><br/>Now, the situation which the PCs are presented with is built off of their input, either in terms of their thematic batteries or their campaign-building discussion in the first session, or in feedback between sessions.  Basically, the GM keeps a running list of flags and uses them to directly inspire the conflicts (character+desire+obstacle) that the situation is built out of.  This is totally <strong>lit crit conflict</strong> all the way.<br/><br/>Because it's, you know, a roleplaying game, the PCs are trying to address the situation (built out of lit crit conflicts), and they do that by engaging the conflict resolution system.  (Short tangent: for the purposes of this thread I'm referring to it as "conflict resolution" but, as that is very confusing for the reasons outlined in this thread, in the book they're just called die checks and there's less confusion.)  The PCs use the mechanics to grab narration from the GM so they can narrate their success/triumph/victory, which is adjudicating conflicts of interests between players at the table.  The "conflict" mechanics do not resolve the lit crit conflict -- that would be pretty boring.  The <strong>"conflict" mechanics</strong> resolve the <strong>conflicts of interest</strong> so that the players are able to address the <strong>lit crit conflicts</strong> that compose the situation.<br/><br/>Remember the first bit where players can engage the conflict resolution system in order to charge up their thematic batteries?  This functions to make the characters fumble and struggle throughout the beginning of the game, revealing all their character faults and flaws.  In other words, at the beginning of the movie Daniel-san gets his ass kicked.  Because the situation is built off of those same thematic batteries, this creates a resonance between the characters and the <strong>lit crit conflicts</strong>, engaging them with the situation as they charge up their batteries.  Then as the game moves into the latter half (actually the latter two-thirds, but whatever), the players can start discharging those thematic batteries, openning up a can of character suffering and hard lessons to whup batman's ass.  Daniel-san wins the tournament.  And how do they unleash that pent-up power?  By <strong>engaging the conflict resolution system</strong> again, this time taking a bonus equal to the penalties taken beforehand.  The resonance set up between the characters and the <strong>lit crit conflicts</strong> pay off in resolving those conflicts through reincorporation.<br/><br/>So there are definitely three different things one might call "conflicts" and they all interact all the damn time.  However, the whole mess becomes clearer when you very carefully distinguish between which one is which.  Well, it all becomes clearer to me.  Am I making any sense whatsoever to you folks?                </div>

<br/>
When you say conflict of interest among the PLAYERS do you really mean that?  I think you do, but I want to be clear.  I take it then that conflict of interest between the CHARACTERS is either the whole of or a subset of what you're calling lit crit conflicts.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm not very fond of mechanics that resolve the former.  I find that the games I enjoy most have players co-operating over what the conflicts of interest are between the Characters and then eagerly employing the system to see how those conflicts resolve.  Taking on a "Narrator" role (like PtA or the The Pool does) is fine but the system is clearly concerned with resolving conflicts *within the fiction*.<br/>
<br/>
I find games that do the latter become confusing and somewhat hostile as players try to wrest control of narative elements.  Player 1: And then it rains!  Player 2: What?  No way, it doesn't rain!  Roll for it.  I find such games often obliterate the lit crit conflicts because the players spend their game time bicking over non-conflict details of the SIS.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>

                            I do indeed mean conflict of interest between the players, but in play it's rarely anything like hostile.<br/><br/>First off, any check is also an opportunity to charge a thematic battery.  If I'm narrating along about how I'm investigating a crime scene and you tell me I should roll, I can charge a level of <em>Curious</em> or <em>Thorough</em> or whatever.  Since we're already hitting up the die system, I can also set higher stakes than I might normally be able to just narrate away.  I can say, for instance, that my stakes are finding the clue we need.  So with you challenging me to roll dice, you are giving me opportunities to develop character and forward the plot.<br/><br/>It's also totally possible and totally legal for two players to face off with each other, roll dice, and both use the same die check to charge up their thematic batteries.  If that doesn't immediately make sense to you, think of <em>every buddy movie ever made</em>.<br/><br/>If you are rolling dice, your stakes are always within the purview of whoever's dice you're rolling.  That means no "and then it rains" rolls, cause no character is controlling the weather (well, usually, at least).  It is far more in the form of "and then I do this" and "back that up with a die roll, mate."  On the other hand, I can call for a die check on you and if I'm not rolling dice against you ("you can't just jump that gorge so easily!"), I have more freedom in the stakes ("or you fall down the cliff") and I can take inspiration for those stakes off of the Set and Prop cogs in play (We're in the Artemis Lowlands, and that cog has the complication "Swept away in the rapids").  So you challenging me helps reinforce the sets and setting.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's an influence from the setting -- one of those diffuse and hard-to-quantify elements of design -- in which we're all playing Victorian-era British naval officers.  Players tend to default towards being very polite to each other, even if they are trying to undermine and subvert each other's plans.  Rank is also always, always present, and in some games there is not only naval rank as well as social standing, family heritages, even feudal ranks, and those are at least given lip service if not explicitly supported.  So while the Captain may be trying to keep the girl on board and the Chaplain wants to smuggle her off, it's this bizarrely <em>polite</em> conflict, with in-character doublethink "I know you're trying to do what I don't want you to, but we won't actually come out and say it, but we'll try and maneuver our way around each other to get what we want."<br/><br/>Additionally, the conflicts of interests between characters are very explicit in the game, and are, yes, totally part of the lit crit conflicts set up in situation engineering.  Situation engineering spits out conflicts and character foils based off of the character concepts in play, so the differences between the players is repeatedly emphasized.  You've got your thematic batteries right there on your sheet, you're passing the scrip when you reference batteries on other sheets, and you're calling them out when you use them.  So if I'm a Closet Socialist and you're an Wealthy Industrialist's Son, there is no hiding that we are often at odds.  Given that the players are all there for an interesting story, it's very very common for them to gleefully tighten the screws on each others' thematic batteries (and pass the scrip doing it) when they call for die checks.  (Playing my Closet Socialist, I will call for a check when you try to ignore and brush past the pauper children on the street, for instance.)  I haven't ever seen a player get annoyed when such a check is called on them, since it's directly hitting his character concept.<br/><br/>Also note that it's quite within the rules to just pass narration to another player when you're done narrating, and in actual play this happens a whole helluva lot more often than direction-by-dieroll.<br/><br/>God, do I blather.                        </div>

If I understand you correctly, I think that's incrediably innovative.  Because it seems like the rolls MUST come in the context of at least one character within the fiction attempting to do something (as opposed to my example of simply two different players wanting different details or events added to the SIS) and then another player can basically ELEVATE it to conflict status.  You've taken say "Yes or roll the dice" and distributed it across the group.<br/>
<br/>
This solves a BIG problem I have with the Character vs. Furniture situation.  I'm very good at recognizing when a character is really Furniture but I'm not very good at recognizing when furniture is really a Character.  *I* might think my cliff is this facinating imposing mountain side worhty of a roll but how do I a) communicate that to the other players and b) recognize if they agree with me.  You've solved the problem because any player can say, "Hey that cliff there's interesting, I want to see if you can handle it."  Rather than the GM accidentally heaping tedium onto the players or missing out on an opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Or to use your own example, "See those pauper children I want you to deal with them."  The pauper children get moved from furniture ("I sweep past them, argonantly) to character ("Oh yeah?  What's the consequence of that?").<br/>

Gee, I thought I'd seen that somewhere before, but I can't put my finger on it now...hmm...<br/>
<br/>
As Rodney Dangerfield would say, "No respect." I thought I'd won an award for most innovative indie RPG for doing just this. In fact, this is really about 95% of all of what Universalis does.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not bitter... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And this coming from Jesse Burneko who Ron Edwards has described this to on several occasions that I can recall. Oh, in Sorcerer only the GM rolls against you, to be sure, but Ron has described the idea of conflicts in that game only occuring when there's a conflict between what the player wants, and what the GM is saying is a good alternative outcome. As opposed to task resolution.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, what Joshua is calling "lit crit conflict" is what Ron calls a "premise." Or, perhaps in this case, a "locally defined premise."<br/>
<br/>
In that way, what Joshua is describing is every good conflict resolution RPG to date. That is, I've said many times about Hero Quest before, that the resolution system resolves outcomes of the conflict that comes as a result of a thematic decision, but that the thematic decision is the one to get into the conflict in the first place. Do I fight here, or do I run? Is it worth enough to me? When we get to the conflict resolution, we see why it's worth it to my character as the augments come out that demonstrate why I as a player see it as meet that my character turn and fight.<br/>
<br/>
So the resolution system supports the decision, but after the fact. The simple player decision of "what my character will do here," is the player solving the character's internal questions, and, thus, creating theme.<br/>
<br/>
What's the "conflict resolution" system for, then? To use Ron's term, it's a "springboard" for creativity in coming up with the next action, likely the next conflict. Oh, I won the fight? Now I have to deal with the big brother of the one I defeated. That establishes another question for the player to answer, but, again, it's as a result of the GM's interpretation of the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
This is a quite common cycle in these games. In none of them does the conflict resolution system decide the premise or lit crit conflict, because in these cases, those decisions are the "fruitful void" that the player is to fill. In Pendragon, on the other hand, such decisions are made by the system quite often (if not every time). If you take away the theme creating choices in a game like Trollbabe then...what do you have left for the player to do?<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say other models aren't possible. Just that I can't think of an example of one.<br/>

                            I've had this discussion before with Vincent, and I remain unconvinced of his argument -- I think we're actually agreeing, but emphasizing different things. I do put my money where my mouth is, though. I define conflict in my published games as "disagreement between two players about 'what happens next'."<br><br>Here's where I get radical:<br><br>All conflicts are conflicts of interest between the players because the characters don't exist. <br><br>Here's where I get less radical. It's not as extreme as it sounds. I stand by the above <i>even when players are "cooperating."</i> Basically, I view it like this: <br><br>"I think X would be cool."<br>"RAD, I think X+Y would be cool"<br>"Ok, roll sucker!"<br><br>-or-<br><br>"I think X would be cool."<br>"Neat, I think Y would be cool"<br>"Ok, roll sucker!"<br><br>The trick is that it can also go like this: <br/><br/>"I think X would be cool."<br/>"Rad. I think X+Y would be cool."<br/>"Ok, no need to roll. X+Y happens. Neat."<br/><br/>-or-<br/><br/>"I think X would be cool."<br/>"Neat, I think Y would be cool"<br/>"Wait, no need to roll. Y is much better. That happens instead, ok?"<br/>"Ok. Maybe X next time, pal."<br/><br/>I think the following is absurd:<br/><br/>"Captain Insano wants X to happen! I'm not saying I do, I mean, I pretty much AGREE with everyone at the table. But, still, Captain Insano want's it! What can I do?!?"<br/><br/>Because the appropriate reaction is this: <br/><br/>"You jackass. Captain Insano doesn't exist. YOU made him up, so YOU want him to do that. Captain Insano doesn't 'actually' think that. He's YOU acting fictionally. Stop pretending otherwise, you're not going to hurt my feelings, silly."<br/><br/>Consider, why do we put up with writers saying things like "Well, the book just wrote itself once I had the characters thought up"? That's nonsense. That's an artist being arty. He wrote the fucking book, ok? It's not as though the Almighty came down and typed it.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the difference in role-playing is adversity. When a SINGLE PLAYER has two characters interacting, we find it pretty flat (i.e. un-fun) in actual play of a role-playing game. (Is this the Czege Principle? I can't remember.) <br/><br/>We have no problem wrapping our brains around a writer pitting two characters in conflict in his/her stories. Why? Because the writer has his own system in his head and process in writing for how this gets resolved. And, by the time we read it, it's resolved. In role-playing, it's not so easy. Then, we have two or more human beings who must resolve between one another "what they want to happen next" in real time. Sometimes it's freeform, sometimes is structured, sometimes it's fiat. Whatever works, it's system.<br/><br/>EDIT: Damn, damn, damn. See what happens when I try to get all radical and take time doing it? Mike Holmes arrives and steals the show. Yeah, also: What he said.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Sorry man,  my Universalis knowledge is weak.  :( I also think you may be misplacing what I'm calling innovative.  Yes, what Josh is describing is conflict resolution and Premise, etc, etc which is there in spades among all the games you mentioned.  But what I find interesting and which I don't think I've seen before (which may very well be in Universalis) is the ability for a player to elevate something to conflict worthy status in the ABSENSE of their character but still not be total director stance players butting heads against fiction contributions.<br/>
<br/>
GM: You are surrounded by small children clamoring for help.<br/>
Player 1: I sweep them asside, arrogantly.<br/>
<br/>
In a game like Dogs in the Vineyard at this point it's up the GM to decide how important the children are.  Are they just color?  The get swept asside.  Or are they more important than that, conflict!  It seems to me that FLFS alows ANY player to decide, "Hey those children are more important!"  And not just in the usual request or signal to the GM that he should step up and have a conflict but to use their OWN dice to combat it.  In other words, the conflict is between the first character and the children but the children are being fueled by the thematic representation of the second character.<br/>
<br/>
This is assuming I understand what Josh is saying.  If I've got it wrong, then I'm going to steal this concept. :)<br/>
<br/>
To address Matt's point I see this as very very different from just "two players who don't agree on what should happen."  I get the whole "the character doesn't exist."  But you can restrict conflict resolution to the realm of conflicting fictional character desire.  As I said earlier, I'm not very fond of games where the players can just make announcements about "what happens" in the absense of character action and motive and then roll dice to see whose version happens.  "Ninjas Attack!", "No, they don't!  Zepplins drop bombs on us!"  Note: If this kind of thing exists I much prefer to be in the context of resource mechanic.  I spend three points and a cave in happens.  But that's beside the point.  Or a goal or scene framing mechanic like PtA and Capes.  Notice in all these situations no one can veto, director power is just passed around.  The system is still only employed to resolve conflicts within the fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Josh's game appears to be a step between pure resolution between fictional characters and the "what happens" thing I describe.  There still must BE a conflict of interest between ficitional characters but the players can claim external elements as thematic extensions of their characters.  I like that.<br/>

                            Minor correction, Jesse: the big-eyed little pauper children don't get any benefit from my Closet Socialist thematic battery.  But I'm certainly more likely to call for such a die check because that sort of thing is something that I'm interested in.  I can call for the check and I set the stakes.  If the pauper kids are done up as a cog in the current situation, they roll dice off the card; if they aren't, the Industrialist's player rolls against a static difficulty factor.<br/><br/><em>Wrinkle:</em> said pauper kids may have been included in the situation because of the Socialist or Industrialist batteries, which means they would probably have an appropriate thematic battery (like "Starving").  This would be doubly true if the pauper kids are set up to be the Industrialist's foil, or the Socialist's, for that matter.<br/><br/><em>Additional wrinkle:</em> the game uses a lot of delegated narration, so you might be playing the pauper kids if your primary character isn't in the scene.  In which case you'd be rolling the dice against the Industrialist.                        </div>

                            Jesse, you said, in part: 
<blockquote>"[C]onflicting fictional character desire."</blockquote>
And:
<blockquote>"The system is still only employed to resolve conflicts within the fiction."</blockquote>
Regarding the first part: If a character doesn't exist, then neither does "his" desire or anything else. It's merely us inflicting his desire upon the fiction. We, the humans playing, are responsible for everything. Often, we don't own up to that. Usually, not doing so ... is pretty harmless.<br/><br/>BUT, don't also read that as some kind of strong advocation for metagaming with little or nothing to say about resolving conflicts "within the fiction." In nearly all games, including the ones I publish, that's what I'm talking about -- stuff in the fiction.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that we're throwing up a bit of a mental bubble between us and "them" where them is the fictional characters and events (setting, details, whatever). And, that bubble's pretty understandable, and usually harmless. Usually. <br/><br/>That's all I'm saying. Pretty much "Here's a weird thing we do. Weird, huh?" No biggie.                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>See, I mostly sort of agree with you in a weird kind of way that probably wouldn't sound like agreement because I game with lots of immersivists. <br/><br/>But, rather than getting into that, let me toss this out there: I agree that the most important conflicts are those that are conflicts of desire between players. But, doesn't that then make it odd that most games to this day, even in the Indie scene, make your ability to effect the game dependent upon your character's ability*? <br/><br/>Really, if the important thing going on is if I, Brand, get to say X about the fiction where you, Matt, want to say Y, isn't it funny that I have to roll my character's Strength vs your character's Dexterity to make it happen? <br/><br/>Which is where, I think, our frission would come from. In any game in which the players ability to author and alter the fiction comes primarily through their character's stats and abilities it is perfectly sound structural logic for people to consider the desires of their characters as being those that matter. You aren't rolling your "Matt gets a say" you're rolling Gawain's "Chaste." So it is your character's abilities that make it happen, not your player desires. <br/><br/>Thus is birthed the whole oddity of trying to use character abilities to yeild player desires, and any number of cognative disconnects of the RPG. <br/><br/><br/><br/>*Yes, I know there are also several games that don't do this. Or do this to a lesser degree. The majority, however, still fall into this mold.                        </div>

(I think we've argued about this before, Matt. But I think I have a clearer statement now, so I'll repeat myself.)<br/><br/>Of course the characters exist -- you actually had to do something to make them up, right? <br/><br/>Solid fictional characters -- like Hamlet, or Oedipus, or even Han Solo -- are completely real. They're not real in the way that the Dr. Pepper bottle on my desk is real, but they are real in the same way that the state of Arizona or the Pythagorean theorem is real. That is, a character is a set of ideas with a particular logic and coherence to them. This inner logic means that some facts will be true about an idea, and some won't be.  <br/><br/>If I tell you that Panama City is the capital of the Khazhakstan, I'm wrong -- even though Panama and Khazhakstan are just ideas. If I tell you that Shakespeare had Hamlet discover string theory, or that Hamlet was totally well-adjusted and had no hangups, I'd be wrong. And by wrong, I mean I'm saying something that is factually untrue, even though Hamlet is a totally made-up imaginary guy. <br/><br/>This means that when a gamer says that Captain Insano wants to do something the player doesn't like, <em>he can be right</em>. The character has a logic to it, and you can't do otherwise without breaking that integrity.[*] This is actually a really, really good thing, for two main reasons. First, we as humans create meaning from the patterns we see, and having a pattern that strong is a sign the group is doing something profoundly right. Second, as an ongoing thing, having creative constraint is really helpful, and when the necessary constraints are arising integrally from the fiction you're making you're cooking with gas. (One of my telltales for whether a Dogs game has really gelled is when players start Giving even when the dice say they can win, just because the imaginative force of the narrative is too strong to ignore.)<br/><br/>So what does it mean when a player says "Captain Insano wants X to happen! I'm not saying I do, I mean, I pretty much AGREE with everyone at the table. But, still, Captain Insano want's it! What can I do?!?", and what does it mean when the players decide to make Insano decide not-X anyway?<br/><br/>What's going on is that the player is saying that the logic of the character inexorably pushes towards X. If we make Insano do not-X, we have a different character. We have a new character who is, coincidentally, also named Captain Insano. This change means that the players have to do some rethinking to figure out what the story actually means, because you need to figure out how and why Captain Insano-2 made the choices he did in the narrative. That reinterpretation work can be a drag on the game, since having a solid intuitive interpretation of the meaning of what has happened really helps figure out what to create <em>next</em>. The right next scene for the game will be different for Insano-1 and Insano-2. <br/><br/>So "I don't want X but my character does" is really a case of "we have downsides whichever path we take -- either do X, which I don't want, or change the character to do not-X, and spend effort recontextualizing the story". Which choice you make really depends on the relative costs and benefits. <br/><br/>[*] Yes, of course sometimes jerks use this line as a cover for bullying. Assume we're not dealing with a jerk.                        </div>

                            Neel, you've gone a hell of a long way to say "Well, characters should have some kind of integrity." <br/><br/>Yeah, no kidding! They SUCK otherwise. I'm not arguing with that. Nor am I arguing that players and people won't face tough, sometimes frustrating choices about what to do with their characters, and that their pet character's integrity may suffer, oh what to do! So, Captain Insano becomes a different character. Ok, so? People don't LIKE this? Ok, so? <br/><br/>None of these things makes Captain Insano real in any of the terms I'm talking about, as should be obvious. What it does is support my notion -- that we actually real people are still responsible for Captain Insano's "choices" (which, of course, are OUR choices and/or self-imposed restrictions), even if those choices suck!<br/><br/>I just don't agree that this in any way makes a character "real" any  more than it makes a perfectly grammatical language "real" like some kind of tangible object. Both languages and characters are media for humans to communicate wonderful ideas to one another. That, in itself, is a beautiful thing, but it possesses no sentience, no ANYTHING (no decision making capability, no will, nada) beyond humans front-loading an idea and deciding that they refuse to make choices. <br/><br/>Again, I restate, characters are not real. Saying so is usually harmless ... until moments like this when it suggests or hints (and then some fool takes it too far) that the human beings who created and defined the character are no longer responsible for choices they LATER make about that character because, magically, that character has assumed its own power. This is nonsense; we gave it that power by pretending it's left our authority somehow. It's deflection of responsibility. Even if we have a fit character, and we paint ourselves into a corner about the character's choices, we're still responsible for the painting and the crummy choices we've made for ourselves. <br/><br/>We dont' have to like it! Nobody ever said it had to work well! But it's our own damn fault. (And, frankly, that too is a pretty harmless observation. I mean, no one's getting beaten with a rod because they broke a character's integrity, you know?)
<blockquote>So "I don't want X but my character does" is really a case of "we have downsides whichever path we take -- either do X, which I don't want, or change the character to do not-X, and spend effort recontextualizing the story". Which choice you make really depends on the relative costs and benefits.</blockquote>
Right on. Agreed. I hate these "the character ain't real" conversations because they're an excercise in either language barrier or cutesy-poo, artsy nonsense where people are endeared to the idea that characters possess some kind of will of their own, and it's a romantic, beautiful thing to imagine. But, it's also supernatural nonsense and factually ridiculous. Anyone can go back and read what I said, and realize that all I'm saying is "Characters are a means by which players/authors inflict their ideas upon a fiction. They are unsentient ideas created by actual human beings, and they possess no tangible qualities any more than does a language or metaphor."                        </div>

                            Matt, reading your response, I think we basically agree about how to run or play a game, but disagree over nomenclature. <br/><br/>I think that trying to equate realness with tangibility does violence to the English language, and worse, it does so in a way that's likely to promote flamewars rather than understanding. Ideas are real things. English is real. Threats can be real. Freedom is real. Mathematics is real. The state of Kansas is real. None of these concepts are tangible, and yet it's perfectly sensible to use the word real to describe all of them. <br/><br/>Saying "Captain Insano is not a person, he's an idea. The people at the table are actual people, and their happiness  takes moral precedence" is perfectly sensible and correct. But when you say it as "Captain Insano isn't real!" you're attacking your fellow player. That's because using the word "real" brings along the extra meaning that the ideas is so incoherent that they don't need to be heeded. That social aggression isn't just rude, it's bad strategy -- it's likely to get your fellow player to dig in his or her heels, which is exactly what you don't want at a moment that calls for flexibility.                        </div>

                            Neel, I can see what you mean by my equating tangibility (or sentience, for another example) with "realness." Harm to the language, maybe. But, also necessary for these conversations, because the problem is pretty obviously the word "real." We're using that word to stand in for a broad range of ideas, and it causes confusion, frustration, and not-actually-disagreeing-disagreements. Yep, seems to me we're pretty much agreeing! I'm on board with what you're saying; that stuff can and does happen, I'm sure. I think the flip side also happens -- people push of responsibility (in a negative sense) and diminish their own credit (which they deserve in a postive sense) to disarm themselves, pretend as though everyone's too nicey-nicey to acknowledge that:<br/><br/>1) One or more humans is responsible for the creation, ideas, and constraints of a character they made up and<br/><br/>2) One or more humans is responsible for the ongoing changes and alterations, good or ill, they assent to for that character.<br/><br/>I'll shut up now! I've already derailed Joshua's interesting thread too much. Sorry, Joshua. Hope there's some nugget worth something in there.                        </div>
