Every time we went through a door, we had to say exactly what we were doing (disabling the security sensors, disabling the communications network, sealing the door behind us). There were lots of doors and we had to say it every time.<br/><br/>It was fun! It made us think about what we were doing. So I can imagine that the forgetting thing could be similarly fun. It encourages you to take it seriously, to make notes of important things.<br/><br/>It reminds me of computer games where you had to write down safe combinations. In one location, you'd get the combination; in another, you'd have to enter it correctly. Making a note of it was fun. It was better than the game saying "Yes, you've got the combination, the safe opens".

The characters inhabit the game world, and have nothing else to memorize except what fictional things they see in their fictional world. My players have their real lives to keep track of, too, and I choose not to slow the game down with things like, "Wait, what was the Sea-king's nephew's name again?" For the player, that dude is a person with seconds of "screen time," but for the character he was a real person that's been seen and maybe interacted with a dozen times. <br/><br/>And there's the added wrinkle that, sometimes, when a player doesn't remember something... it's the GM's fault. Maybe I gave it a stupid name. Maybe I didn't describe the thing, or the person, well enough to make them memorable.<br/><br/>Finally, and maybe most importantly, sometimes weeks of real life have passed between sessions, whereas only minutes of game-time have elapsed. For the player, the clue about the trapped corridor was a month ago; for the character, it was ten feet and five minutes ago.<br/><br/>If roleplaying a routine is fun for you\u2014as in Graham's starship-intrusion example\u2014then go for it. Sometimes that kind of memory game <i>is</i> an important part of the play. That's cool. <br/><br/>But I don't believe that RPG characters and their players are joined at the brain. Sometimes you play characters who are smarter or sharper or dumber or duller than you. And you are always operating in a fictional world that is a degree (or several) removed from you, unlike your character, for whom that world is real and tangible and memorable.

Try harder!"<br/><br/>I eventually stopped doing this, and now use the following system:<br/><br/>"If you think your character clearly would remember something, say so, and whoever in the group remembers should give the info.  If you're not sure if your character would remember, then his recollection is tied to yours; so if this matterrs to you, note-taking might be wise."  No one seems to have trouble buying into this, and once everyone's bought in, there's no dissatisfaction in play.

Unfortunately, that also means that some players will make poor design choices and wind up playing a bad game. Sometimes through mistaken design. Sometimes out of sheer blindness or carelessness.<br/><br/>The upside is that good design decisions can allow for a group to co-design an RPG that suits the groups preferences. It is very hard to modify, say, football, to allow a group of people with highly disparate capabilities to all have fun. I can't have fun playing football with my kids. I can have fun playing RPGs with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273570/#Comment_273570" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T05:47:32+00:00" title="May 29, 2010  5:47AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2010 5:48AM by marknau.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To all,<br/><br/>RPGs are so diverse and flexible, and played under so many different conditions and with so many disparate groups that it is problematic to point to any component and say "Oh, yes, always good" or "Oh, always bad."<br/><br/>Analogy time.<br/><br/>If I'm cooking for my family, I know all the conditions present, such as what they like and what they are allergic to and what they are in the mood for right now.<br/><br/>If I'm cooking for strangers, no.

I was thinking about using something like this:\n<blockquote>If you, the player, need information about the setting or the world or advice on how to handle a certain issue, the GM should say, \u201cWho do you want to ask?\u201d Then you pick any NPC in the setting that your character has previously been in contact with and asks them that question, in character, as if remembering a conversation had with the NPC in the past. The GM should answer the question in character as well. The answer may not necessarily be the exact truth, but it\u2019s what the character has learned from others.</blockquote>\nHopefully that will make divulging information flow more naturally in the game and even support other things like character development.  You could actually make it apply to both NPCs and PCs, so you could ask the other players for information too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273584/#Comment_273584" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T10:07:00+00:00" title="May 29, 2010 10:07AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the question "Does your character remember?" is the unheralded hero of this thread.

If they forget something, giving them the option of putting it back in-character is empowering rather than mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273601/#Comment_273601" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T13:47:30+00:00" title="May 29, 2010  1:47PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why aren't players remembering?

You know, from all the old advice in game manuals which give advice like "the GM should try to surprise the players if the characters are surprised," or "players shouldn't have knowledge that their characters don't," or all those "DON'T READ THIS SECTION IF YOU AREN'T THE GM!!!" disclaimers and all that.<br/><br/>At least for my group, that approach is extremely limiting. Frankly, it treats us like we're stupid-- dramatic irony is used all the time to good effect in drama, literature, and so forth, and there's no reason that it can't also be used well in roleplaying. If a player forgets something, then the rest of the group (GM or other players) tell him/her. Why not? The interesting question isn't "Do I, the player, remember that fact?" Instead, it's "Should my character remember that fact?" A GM is not the privileged source of creation in roleplaying, the whole group is. I've always found that our games are much more successful (poignant, meaningful-in-a-literary-sense, intellectually and morally stimulating) when we trust players to make <i>informed</i> decisions about the setting and their characters. Our method is simple: tell the player the information, and then she can decide whether or not it is better (by whatever qualification she chooses) if that character knows/remembers. <br/><br/>(Yes, some people will argue that this breaks a feeling of immersion or some-such, and that's fine-- do whatever suits your play style the best! But I personally think it is false to assume that the only way a person can only enjoy a game is if she wholly identifies with her character, including states of knowledge, etc. YMMV.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273622/#Comment_273622" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T23:40:58+00:00" title="May 29, 2010 11:40PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>Why aren't players remembering?

(Which is at least part of the reason why I don't really take notes anymore, but more on that in a bit.)<br/><br/>So, names.  I've tried being better with them and didn't get very far with it, and I think I finally figured out why:  the hardest names for me to keep straight are:<br/><br/>* names which are very similar to other NPC names  ("Bob" vs. "Rob" or "Elidryn" vs. "Gwendolyn", for example; the more the names sound alike, the more I'm likely to confuse them)<br/>* names of NPCs I interact with very rarely (3 times a session and I'll remember their name; twice, I probably will; once, I'll start to remember it the third or fourth session in a row; less frequently than that, good fucking luck)<br/>* names of NPCs I don't expect to interact with ever again (I will *never* remember these, sometimes not even *while we are still talking to them*)<br/>* names of bland NPCs (they come back, but they have no memorable qualities, and so I don't have anything to attach a name to nor any reason to want to)<br/>* names of NPCs who I assign "clever" nicknames to (the nickname will always supplant the actual name in my head)<br/><br/>...which, with the exception of the last one, basically suggests to me that I need <i>both</i> uniqueness and repetition (and the <i>expectation of repetition</i>) to put a detail into my memory.  If a detail is flung out and doesn't get flagged in my attention as something that'll come back again and again, it won't stick.  I expect a lot of details to go into various scenes, but as a player, I don't consider it my job to remember every single one of them any longer than an hour or so at the very most; when we come back to the game a week later, I really only want the "important" stuff in my head.  (As a GM, I feel like I need to keep track of details in a more systematic and persistent way, but only expect the players to remember the stuff I emphasize via uniqueness and repetition.  The rest of it they can ask me for if they've forgotten and think it's important.)<br/><br/><br/>As far as note-taking goes, I force myself to stay organized as a GM, because it makes it easier on me later on...but as a player, I tend to just jot down the broad strokes of things that directly impact my character rather than try to document everything that happens in the game; doing more than that just seems like too much busywork for too little reward, so I stopped doing it.  I also got sick of spending more time organizing/reading my notes than interacting with the other people at the table.  <br/><br/>So nowadays when I need a detail two weeks later that I don't recall, I just ask; and if I find myself having to ask more than once, I'll either remember it on my own or I'll write it down when the GM shoots me the "for fuck's sake, this is the sixth time you've asked me that" look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273685/#Comment_273685" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T18:03:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  6:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>That sounds like a perfect example of forgetfulness indicating that something's wrong with the adventure.</blockquote>\nWell, it can be, sure. But as I say, my players report the main reason they don't remember something is that they know if they forget, I will always step in and save them, every single time.  Would the example change in your mind if every single fact that the players forgot was central to the adventure, and had been established and re-established over and over, say, 1,000 times?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Seriously, if all that family stuff was genuinely important, the players would remember.</blockquote>\nThat is just wrong. Players have memories like anyone else. They aren't perfect. Besides, taste is at work here too.  I am far less likely to remember family stuff than I am criminal stuff, because I read a ton of crime fiction and looooove everything about it.  Does that mean family stuff is bad to put in the game? No, it just means that I'm not as likely to remember it, even given the exact same play, as someone who really loves family dramas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273711/#Comment_273711" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T06:34:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  6:34AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience has been much like J.D.'s. I very often get the distinct feeling that they aren't even trying at all. I started printing out little business cards for my D&amp;D game that have portraits from <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>, the NPC's name, and a little descriptor, like "Ilsevele Miritar, Coronal of Myth Drannor," or "Fflar Starbrow Melruth, Ancient Hero of Myth Drannor." So far, it's helped, but we're not terribly far into this new campaign, so we'll see. I've been tempted to use the "Don't remember? Neither does your character!" notion before, simply because it really seems like they're not even trying. Worse for me is when they refuse to learn the NPC's name, and instead come up with some ridiculous nickname for him. It got to the point in my last D&amp;D campaign where they started just assigning NPC's random celebrity names. They refuse to learn "Marc," but they'll recognize him only if I call him "Forest Whitaker." I'm hoping the visual cue of the card will help them remember, just like seeing somebody's face helps you remember. So far, so good, but again, too early to say anything for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273712/#Comment_273712" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T07:46:39+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  7:46AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know: I'm with Graham on this one. Unless your game involves dozens and dozens of NPCs with different names, or those NPCs really AREN'T important to what's going on, then I've never seen people forget names or important information.<br/><br/>Again, there is a big difference between remembering the name of "that bar we stopped at two weeks ago" and a significant NPC or detail relevant to play. I think one main reason people seem to forget the King's name in a D&amp;D game is because it usually isn't all that relevant. I mean, those same players probably remember the names (and stats!) of the monsters they fight. Or, at least they do much much more often.<br/><br/>I've found that when I playing games where NPCs are really important (like a lot of Forge-type relationship map games, or whatever you want to call them), those things are rarely difficult for people to remember.<br/><br/>But these days I pretty much always also want the players to be involved in the prep as much as possible, if it just means the GM is writing up NPCs in reaction to people`s Keys, Beliefs, Traits, or whatever. Stuff that`s personally relevant to you is easy to remember--and all the other stuff, if it`s just details, we don`t need to sweat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273716/#Comment_273716" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T08:41:21+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  8:41AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Unless your game involves dozens and dozens of NPCs with different names, or those NPCs really AREN'T important to what's going on, then I've never seen people forget names or important information.</blockquote>\nIn my case, I'm talking about NPC's who had been the central focus of the past three sessions.

If you meet that cute girl with the red hair and square glasses and have a good conversation with her and all those visual cues, body language cues and context cues add up... you might remember her very well, even if you forget her name the next time you see her.<br/><br/>Since Players only have that verbal cue to bring up (unless like jason above and often, myself as a GM, we use pictures to help give another visual cue) a name that is shorthand for an entire, often incomplete persona.  On top of that, names like Bob and Smith have modern day context.... Ellowin and Tarn and Albannadar don't.  We all know that Bob is a pretty common name, and often shorthand for William.  We all know that Carlos often mean hispanic naming convention and that Aiko is probably japanese girl's name.  In a fantasy game, all that built up, common world experience is out the freakin window.  So, Ellowin just sounds like "placeholder X".<br/><br/>Next, we've got to talk about context and time.  What is happening to the characters can be pretty immediate stuff.  The characters met Gish three episodes, which happens to only be about a day past in character time.  In the player's time, its been 3 weeks or 3 months.  Lots of other stuff has been overwritten in our brains from that point.  How does anyone expect to remember?<br/><br/>I take pretty copious notes.  I ask for NPCs names twice and since I often have odd spellings for their names, I ask the GM how he/she spells the name.<br/><br/>Another odd thing about names in superhero games.  Codenames are often easier for me to remember than the characters's secret ID name.  Why?  Because codenames are supposed to indicative of the super.  Dr. Deathkill is probably not a shining paragon of restraint and justified violence.  And because codenames get repeated a lot at the table, while the secret IDs are not.. I sometimes forget my own PC's secret Id and have to look the damn thing up.  <br/><br/>Now.  Mapping and figuring where one is.  There are so many cues in our lives, that old house with the odd red shutter that is broken, the gnarled tree that looks like a rhino smoking a pipe.  But these cues are not found on a typical dungeon map.  There is no description of the shift from ruddy brown rock to a deeper blue shale that might say to everyone, "hey, we are going down lower".  That minute detail is left to the imagination, because it would slow the story down to a crawl if it was included.    While figuring out that room X is above room Y in an underground complex would require a die roll from this GM, figuring out how to backtrack from a simple 4 room tomb would not.  <br/><br/>One of the things I've stressed as a GM is not just describing an NPC but their demeanor.  I will blatantly lie in an NPC voice, but if that NPC is obviously lying, I don't leave it just to the dialog the NPC is spouting.  I will say, this NPC is being shifty, his body language is off... you KNOW he is lying.  Not every NPC is that obvious, but I have used that more than once. <br/><br/>I want to give the players as much information as I can, in as succinct format as I can.  And it is an art form and sometimes I fail miserably... thinking I've given them the pertinent motivation or clue to the next idea... and when I do fail, I go meta and say , I made a mistake, here is what I was trying to convey... now you have the information, you guys can make a decision and move on from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273726/#Comment_273726" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-31T09:59:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2010  9:59AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Unless your game involves dozens and dozens of NPCs with different names, or those NPCs really AREN'T important to what's going on, then I've never seen people forget names or important information.</blockquote>\nIn my case, I'm talking about NPC's who had been the central focus of the past three sessions.

The players are coming to King Foril pretty damn cold, they haven't thought about King Foril in some time.  5 or 6 sessions is 5 or 6 weeks.

The immediate reaction in this case was, "This is crazy, you've got all these NPC's, how can I keep them all straight?" There were, in fact, only about 3-4 NPC's with names who occurred in more than one session throughout the entire campaign. I'm not sure how much easier I can make it. If they're having that much trouble, they should take notes, right? Which I've told them, several times now. They wouldn't.<br/><br/>In the latest campaign, I've started using those little business cards\u2014I think you put it quite well, we don't just remember names in real life, we remember faces with them. Even if they're just little avatar faces on a message board. I've also delegated writing the session recap to a player. I really stopped writing recaps because it was too much writing so much of the adventure twice\u2014first when I planned it, and again in the recap. I write it once when I plan the adventure, and then someone else writes it once in the recap. Like the business cards, it's too early to say for sure, but it looks like it might have changed some of the dynamic. Before, there was almost a sense of pride in not remembering the NPC's or what happened before, because it was a fun way to antagonize the GM. Now, I've got a player who cares about those things, because he's writing the recap's. <em>He's</em> now reminding the others about the NPC's and what happened before. So, it's not just antagonizing me, it's antagonizing <em>him</em>, and while antagonizing the guy on the other side of the screen is fun, antagonizing someone on <em>your</em> side is considerably less so. So I've noticed that vague sense of pride falling away. That seems to have improved their general recall by an order of magnitude so far.<br/><br/>But again, too soon to really say for sure. Is it really working, or is it just a new campaign where everything's still fresh and thus, easy to remember? Time will tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273788/#Comment_273788" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T08:20:42+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  8:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on the opposite extreme as a player.  I've found that in many situations, if I don't consciously pay attention, my mind wanders.  The two solutions I've found for this are to do something repetitive and mindless with my hands (making chain armor and knitting both work well), and to take notes. <br/><br/>That said, I'm of two minds on the "I don't remember" thing.  For one, the player is not the character, and the game session is not the in-game experience; it may be a week or a month since the last play session, while only an hour might have elapsed for the character.  So I'm not irritated by occasional "I don't remember" moments.  On the other hand, if it's chronic, it's a sign that the other players are not as invested in the characters and the story as I am, and that gets really old really fast.  <br/><br/>I've also found that it's really difficult to try to change player behavior without being explicit about what's going on.  "Look, guys, I'm really getting frustrated at having to remind you all the time about what you did in the last session, and every time you meet an NPC it's like meeting him for the first time.  What can we do to get you more involved in the game?"  This works so much better, I've found, than punitive approaches like "You don't remember?  Neither does your character.  Guess you'll have to start taking notes or something."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273797/#Comment_273797" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T09:16:57+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  9:16AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to keep notes during a session because we usually go at least 2 weeks between sessions.

Let's say your into your fourth session of a campaign and neither the GM or the players remember anything about X from the first session. Chances are that X probably wasn't that interesting, and if it isn't interesting, it probably shouldn't be important. Which is why I'm a big fan of ascending minor NPCs to major roles and vice versa depending on how players react to them.   <br><br>Having said that, I'm not sure that player forgetfulness should be synonymous with character forgetfulness. I once played a superstitious thug that spent about half a session forgetting that he was superstitious simply because I forgot. The other players just let me get on with it without trying to correct me and it was only towards the end that I realised my mistake. On the one hand, I think it made my character more believable in the way that people are seldom one thing all the time. But on the other hand, I can see how if that kind of thing happened too many times, it would become impossible to get a grip on who the character is.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276323/#Comment_276323" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T07:19:54+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  7:19AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On not playing one of your character's aspects, just like an NPC (or any other fictional element) that seems to be fading into the background, if you can't manage to hold onto some aspect of your character, it probably wasn't interesting in the current situation. It may be that the GM (and the other players) didn't present you with opportunities to be superstitious, or it may be that when opportunities arose, they weren't interesting to you, so you subconsciously chose to "forget".<br/><br/>Burning Wheel has an interesting way to deal with these sorts of changes. The trait vote can remove traits as well as add new ones. If no one is playing one of your traits, let's get it off the character sheet and get something more grabby for the current situation on there.<br/><br/>If the GM (or other players) aren't playing into one of your traits, they (especially the GM) need to step up, or communicate why they aren't hitting that trait in some meaningful way.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276379/#Comment_276379" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T11:11:48+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 11:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, some people are just plain forgetful.

I have one player, for example, who constantly remembers certain visual details of things from months, even years previous, that I made up on the spot at the time and have long since forgotten. When I mis-state one of these details, it totally breaks her immersion. Since I usually try to use intentionally sparse descriptions (in order for the players to fill in the blanks in their heads, leading to stuff I could have never have thought of), I've had to retrain myself to pay way more attention to certain kind of details than I would normally, as this player obviously cares about them.<br/><br/>Also...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>Can't figure out the puzzle?

Neither can your player!<br/>Didn't map the dungeon and therefore don't notice that the room you are in is right above that other room?  Neither does your player!</blockquote>\nI think the first of these is the real conundrum. The others (including the initial topic of this post) can usually be dealt with with some combination of common sense, taking the situation into account and, occasionally, stunting mechanics (especially useful for things like seduction, depending on the game). But the puzzle problem is harder (unless the puzzle really isn't intended as puzzle, but just as a really sophisticated locked door). But the point of a puzzle is in the figuring out, so most approaches that work for the others tend to suck the air out of puzzles. Seems to me a technique that worked decently for puzzles would work well for the others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12196/dont-remember-neither-does-your-character" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12196/dont-remember-neither-does-your-character" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12196/dont-remember-neither-does-your-character/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12196%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12196%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
