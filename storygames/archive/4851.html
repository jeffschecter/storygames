Its a Sci-Fi Convention held in Philadelphia.  As a Gamer I've never been to a Sci-fi con and was a bit uncertain how much good gaming would be found at such a thing.  I know Don and Joanna Corcoran who were organizing the gaming there and they were initially the only reason Michael and I considered going to the Sci-fi con.  We were happily surprised when we got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a regular of the New Jersey Game Conventions run by Vincent Salzillo Dex Con and Dreamation.  If youve been to a Vinny con then you understand what I mean when I say that Philcon had the kind of cozy comfort I've come to cherish from my much loved Jersey cons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two rooms for gaming where shared by Board, Card, Minature and RPG gaming.  A good deal of the RPG gaming was indie.  I had a full table for my Tangled Fates game in development.  The two games of With Great power were full and happy!  I got to play Shock finally and I really enjoyed that game.  Michael ran Mechaton and had a blast.  I saw Mortal Coil and Spirit of the Century running full and entertaining tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoyed myself this weekend and plan on attending next year because of it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108839/#Comment_108839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T09:40:34+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  9:40AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some pictures of the event<br/>\n<img alt="th_Picture086.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x252/kats_whim/Philcon07/th_Picture086.jpg"/><br/>\nthat mechaton wth Mike<br/>\n<img alt="th_Picture058.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x252/kats_whim/Philcon07/th_Picture058.jpg"/><br/>\na close up of the battle<br/>\n<img alt="th_Picture034.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x252/kats_whim/Philcon07/th_Picture034.jpg"/><br/>\nMel running Shock<br/>\n<img alt="th_Picture030.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x252/kats_whim/Philcon07/th_Picture030.jpg"/><br/>\nthere was even some junglespeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108875/#Comment_108875" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T12:35:40+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 12:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a lot of fun this weekend as well. I know that Don and Joanna put a lot of work into making this a good gaming con and it showed. I'm a little bummed that my games didn't happen, but it meant I got to play other great games that were running at the same time. We also generated a fair amount of interest in the games that we were playing. I know that Joanna had a table of folks that absolutely loved The Mountain Witch, and I lost count of how many people saw us playing Mechaton and wanted to know where to buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108992/#Comment_108992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T09:45:54+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  9:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed Philcon a great deal.  I'm looking forward to future years as the RPG track grows from this year's solid footing.  The games I ran or played were:<br>Shock: on a future Earth ruined by pollution where humans and their robot servants competed for ultimate survival.  The robots, inspired by the \u2018Religion of the New Fuel\u2019 ultimately lost to a small band of humans.  The humans had been forced to wean themselves from their oxygen re-breathers and thereby avoided the poison created by a human bio-engineer for her robot lover.  In this game, we learned the power of the d4, which changed a robot\u2019s success into a failure and thereby saved humanity.<br><br>Spirit of the Century:  Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars.  Having played this at Dexcon when my brother Bill White ran it, I now enjoy running it myself.  I\u2019m pocketing a few lessons for next time, including specific compels for the various characters and other ways to keep the spotlight moving around.  Bill's going to run it again at Dreamation for anyone who likes Indiana Jones and rocketships!  <br><br>Tangled Fates.  Kat Miller\u2019s game-in-development was an exercise in creativity.  The characters, the situation, plot, and conflict resolution are all based on interpretation of art cards.  Our story gathered a dragon, an angel, a unicorn, and a sphinx in a struggle to save the world against an evil necromancer.  At least two of the players were new to small press games, especially storytelling games, although that had absolutely no apparent impact on their enthusiasm and impact on play.  <br><br>Kingdom of the Lost.  An ashcan--the characters are basically the homeless that can be overlooked throughout the country.  The game featured a neat character generation mechanism where each player added a secret to the history of the other players\u2019 characters.  Play focused on the characters struggle to uncover these secrets as a means of determining what led them to becoming homeless.  We didn\u2019t reach an endgame phase, but the game was intriguing enough that I\u2019d like to try it again.       <br><br>And a highlight, of course, was dinner at a local pub with Brennan, Dave, the Millers, and the Corcorans and friends, organized by Don.  <br><br>Mel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109139/#Comment_109139" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T08:32:30+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  8:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the postitive comments guys!  Don and I have slowly putting together our thoughts on how things went.  My initial review is over on our <a href="http://www.realityvault.net/blog/games/2007/11/philcon-gaming-2007.html" rel="nofollow">gaming blog</a>.  Don hopes to post more about specific games later this week.<br><br>The woman who ran our "Using Improv Techniques to Improve Role-playing" workshop hasposted about her experience <a href="http://www.alycewilson.com/november07/philcon07_2.htm" rel="nofollow">running the workshop (amont other things)</a>.  Improv is something I probaby wouldn't have included in the program if Story Games hadn't put the idea in my head.

The three other guys <i>really</i> got into taking control of the narrative, setting their stakes, using trust to help and to hinder... I hardly had to do any work at all.  It was fantastic!  Afterward all three wanted to know where to get the book and later that night one of the guys asked me to describe the game to another friend of theirs who hadn't played.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
