Where the game dictates not only how the characters do their thing, but how the GM should run the game, how the sessions are bound together to make a longer campaign, how the very fabric of the story is woven.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr Reign. Where the company rules give the game continuity as the company is more important than the PCs themselves. The company helps writing the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nArs Magica, based around the thought of troupe play with more PCs than players, and only three or four adventures per ingame year. So the game follows the events over possibly several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nPendragon, where only one adventure is played every ingame year, and random tables give the events for the rest of the year, also with the assumption that several years will be played, in longer campaign the players will find themselves playing the children of their first characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other such games out there that I should look at?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146411/#Comment_146411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:28:24+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:28AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Sign In Stranger</i> is gaged for long-term play, but deliberately paced long-term play with an end state.  <br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday </i>really shines in long-term play, and includes a very elegant mechanic (Transcendence) for removing characters from the story before they become more than human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146416/#Comment_146416" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:40:56+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to what Jason said:<br/><br/><i>Agon</i> works great in both short- and long-term play, with characters dying tragically when their Fate meter expires.

The longer story arcs of Primetime Adventures I would say are meant for a "long campaign". The 5/9 session games are not, though, unless you agree that you're going to play more than one "season".<br/><br/>I agree with Ryan's account of Wicked Age... however, I'm not sure that this is "long enough". In playing like 10 sessions, I could totally see how you could flesh out, populate, and explore a grand fantasy world as if you were reading shorter tales from an epic collection. However, I imagine if I played it every week for a year in the same campaign world... well, I *could* see myself getting tired of it. Or else, wanting to start over with a New campaign world (or another corner of the world) and starting again. For me, just at a guess, I'd say my upper limit with In a Wicked Age would be about 20 sessions, max. I've not played anywhere near that limit yet, though: My current max is 3.<br/><br/>Reign was mentioned: Although I didn't personally like the world that much, the AD&amp;D 2E game world of Birthright I thought was a great campaign-focused world. Sure, you're levelling doodz just like any other AD&amp;D world (at the time), but you've got the big picture (the countries developing, conquering, changing) as well. It was a *different* kind of extended campaign.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146765/#Comment_146765" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T19:56:54+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  7:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>I read through BW last x-mas, but it didn't stand out as especially campaign centric.
