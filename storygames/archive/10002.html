The conclusion of that fable is up to you."</i> It's draws upon the symbolism of the chessboard to create the characters and the world. (More info: <a href="http://games.forgreatjustice.net/2009/07/31/dance-and-the-dawn-whats-the-game-like/" rel="nofollow">what the game is like</a> and <a href="http://games.forgreatjustice.net/2009/07/29/dance-and-the-dawn-a-retrospective-and-a-hint/" rel="nofollow">how it came to be</a>.)<br/><br/>Here's an example of a character from the game. I'm hoping you can play along with the thread and try it out.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/><b>Lady Akal, formerly a Pirate Queen.</b> Her chess piece is the black knight, and she is likely to be willful, driven, and reckless.<br/><br/><i>"In sashes and six seashells she's bejeweled;<br/> each taken from the lands her bandits ruled."</i><br/><br/>* I once was a Queen of the Most Ferocious Pirates.<br/>* I loved my horde of gold and gems.<br/>* I lost my prized ship, the Windstar Prestige, to the royal navy.<br/>* I wish to take back the seas.<br/><br/>This is what we know about her. If you had created her character, you might know more about her than this, but we're probably going to learn the most about her in play.<br/><br/>It is the second dance of the night, and she is dancing with <b>Lord Jyn</b>, who is represented by the white bishop. Right now, all we know is that Jyn is scholar, and is quite driven in his pursuit of knowledge. What we really want to find out as much as possible about Lord Jyn. Is he the key to finding a happy ending, or is there something darker lurking within him?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>How this thread works: Lord Jyn (myself) will ask a question, and <b>anyone can answer (in the voice of Lady Akal)</b>. If he likes your answer, <b>Lady Akal may ask a question (provided by anyone on this thread)</b>.<br/><br/>Shall we dance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221934/#Comment_221934" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T10:58:55+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 10:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Lord Jyn:</b> "My lady, I am surprised at your choice of dress for this occasion.
