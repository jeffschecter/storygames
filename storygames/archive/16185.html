It\u2019s almost like the text is taking an author or director stance, where what happens to your character is less significant than what happens in the story, but the resolution mechanic is in a pawn or actor stance, where the character\u2019s success means everything to the player. Back to <b>PTA</b> for an example: the character in the spotlight for any episode is automatically more likely to succeed at everything they do, and has more resources to spend to further promote the success of their actions, yet the text emphasises building a collaborative story where success or failure exist only to serve the developing plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to scratch this itch, which has been bothering me for a while, I\u2019ve come up with this as a basic model for a new system:<br/>\n-\tThe player opens a scene, stating what their character is doing.<br/>\n-\tThe GM (or another PC) can interrupt at any time with a challenge: they present the acting PC with an obstacle which will cause them to lose something.<br/>\n-\tThe acting PC then <i>chooses</i> whether their character prevails or not. If they prevail, they narrate how they overcome the obstacle and carry on; if not, they narrate how they lose whatever the opposition has stated and they gain a Drama point.<br/>\n-\tIf you have any Drama points, you can spend one when you choose to prevail, so not only do you not lose anything, you also gain something as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s always up to the target of the challenge what happens: obviously, they can narrate a string of successes if they want, but they\u2019ll never earn the Drama points they need to achieve anything really important. A random element could be reinserted if Drama points were coins and players could choose to toss one to see what happens, rather than choosing their own success or failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s the rough basis anyway: I could do with some more suggestions of things PCs might lose. So far I\u2019ve got:<br/>\n-\t<b>Time:</b> They can be delayed by a critical amount.<br/>\n-\t<b>Cash/Possessions:</b> They can be forced to part with things.<br/>\n-\t<b>Consciousness:</b> They can be knocked out.<br/>\n-\t<b>The trail:</b> They can come to a dead end.<br/>\n-\t<b>Respect:</b> Their reputation can be damaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny feedback appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368942/#Comment_368942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T04:47:20+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  4:47AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear about PTA, the Producer has enough budget to neatly check the effectiveness of a 3-Screen Presence character when it counts.<br><br>Your system reminds me of Archipelago II, if you negotiated instead of using random outcome cards.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368957/#Comment_368957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T07:25:40+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  7:25AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Their relationship with other PC / NPC can also be damaged, if the system hay some kind of gauge for that.

In games where the rules more or less tell us that we should be looking for interesting outcomes regardless of a character's success or failure, it is still the responsibility of the player to advocate for the success of their character, as it has been since the beginning of the hobby. I've thought about this too! It doesn't always make sense, but it's a hard thing to get around while still having players invested in the stories of the characters.<br><br>Your system doesn't really change this, though. It just takes the chance out of whether a character succeeds or fails leaving it to group negotiation, and pushing the advocacy to 'how much will it cost the character?' The player is still advocating for the character to suffer fewer consequences. I mean, can't we carry your original question on to this system as well? If we're just interested in interesting outcomes, shouldn't how the characters suffer consequences be based on what's interesting?<br><br>That's not to criticize the system! It sounds cool. But I don't think it answers the question you're posing.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368972/#Comment_368972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T09:42:13+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  9:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to be pedantic here -- you are talking about Pawn Stance.<br><br>Quote: "A subset of Author Stance which lacks the retroactive "motivation" of the character to perform the actions."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368983/#Comment_368983" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T11:24:59+00:00" title="March 23, 2012 11:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite>why do we weight the outcomes towards the character\u2019s success?</blockquote>\nI dunno!

Like, in a game where I'm primarily concerned with my character achieving their goals, I can play off that. IAWA sets up some good (potential) tension with what's in my character's best interest. PTA has the Issue, which is explored and addressed through scenes involving my character.  But just on this skeleton, I wouldn't know when to make my guy fail and when to make him succeed. I get that one gives me a tradeoff one way and one gets me a tradeoff another way, but so what? Like, what am I doing in this game when I make that decision?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369025/#Comment_369025" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T16:03:54+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  4:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite><strong>BUT...</strong>if both potential outcomes are interesting and can advance the story, why do we weight the outcomes towards the character\u2019s success?</blockquote>\nI don't think this is accurate.  In at least a few stake setting games (I don't recall if PTA allows this, but Smallville and Dogs in the Vineyard does - and I think PTA works if you play it this way) you can set stakes where a "winning" result for the play can result in the character losing something they want.<br><br>In a Smallville game, I was a pilot trying to convince another character to come join us in an air raid. The other character just got his ego wounded and was at the bar drinking his sorrows. He didn't want to go. I wanted him to go. As it escalated, I switched tactics and stated that my roll confirmed that he didn't go, that he's stay in the bar and miss a chance at proving his experimental airplane to be a success (which was something I did not want either).  I was playing to the PLAYER however. I knew what the player wanted for this character, despite what the character wanted.<br><br/>So, by the same token, most stake systems work to drive towards what the players want - which is usually good things for the character, but not always.  In fact, giving other players what they want through storytelling and roleplaying is a way where you might avoid the conflict system altogether.<br/><br/>But systems lean towards favoring the players - if not always then when it's important - so that we have the power to guide the game "when it's important" to us. Otherwise, you run the risk of "missing" when you really REALLY want to make it. Those moments aren't often, and are usually the story moments that a player has been building towards.<br/><br/>To go back to PTA, the spotlight is more powerful for this reason.  The producer does have the power to fight back, as Jason points out, but those spotlight episodes are the explicitly that time where the player can shape the story to fit the vision that's been building up in the episodes prior to that one and/or so they can enjoy the fallout from it for the episodes that follow.  The player will probably not get complete say, but they get enough power where they have a good chance to prevent things from going in a direction they do NOT want. Maybe someone has been building to have their cop promoted to Detective. The episode might play out where she doesn't end up getting detective, but she has enough power to pivot to something else she finds interesting (maybe she joins IA instead, or she quits in protest of corruption, or she gets kicked out so she can explore a darker side).                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369130/#Comment_369130" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-25T05:31:17+00:00" title="March 25, 2012  5:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one glaring thing that jumped out at me in this thread is the Trail outcome in the OP.

And about wanting our own character to fail, I can't put it better that Ron Edwards here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=26413.msg252695#msg252695" rel="nofollow">Players wanting their PCs to fail?</a><br/><br/>That post works as a reply to the opening post of this thread, too.

Many games have moments where you compare what you would get if you succeed and what it would cost you, and you leave the conflict and choose to fail.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard entire conflict and balance is based on this, for example: the GM has to try to get the player to choose to leave the conflict (losing) by their own will to avoid a very costly raise.<br/><br/>The problem is that the character has to TRY. If the player choose stakes that equal to "hosing his own character" ("If I win the conflict, my character is defeated and robbed") going against the rules about stakes, the conflict rules don't work anymore: <br/><br/>PTA has the same kind of stakes, but after the drawing of the cards, the conflict is over. There are no raises, back-and-forth or other follow-up mechanic: the conflict is over, you get the stakes or not. But even if you win the stakes, an hostile narrator can still hose you.  So in PTA the choice about "what is more important" is not done after a raise, but right at the moment you choose the stakes.  It's the most important part of the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369535/#Comment_369535" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T18:42:34+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 6:42PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's a little different than giving in in Dogs (or With Great Power, which I have a lot more play experience with.) In those, the characters just plain get beat.  They aren't willing or able to go the distance.  <br/><br/>That's a little different than what I was thinking of, and I think different from the aspect of the minigame/mechanic in the OP that makes it a bit problematic.   If I lose my stakes in PTA, but gain narration, the game works just fine if, looking at my character's issue and where they are on their arc, I narrate something pretty terrible for my character.  Similarly, if I win both my stakes and narration, PTA still works okay if I narrate something pretty terrible for my character. But the Issue (and the character arc mechanic, now that I think about it some more) is what makes that work. If I'm just randomly doing it sometimes or not doing it other times, there's no point to that decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu" title="Alejandro_Etsu"><img alt="Alejandro_Etsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i28.tinypic.com/2uqiyv8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu">Alejandro_Etsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380318/#Comment_380318" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T03:03:28+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  3:03AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Cthulhu Dark, you can <a href="http://www.thievesoftime.com/news/cthulhu-dark/cthulhu-dark-roll-to-fail/" rel="nofollow">roll to fail</a>.<br/><br/>In Houses of the Blooded and Blood &amp; Honor, you can choose to make your character fails after a successful roll.

My favourite scene was a kung-fu monkey talking to a bartender in Lost Vegas trying to find the location of the wasp-women hive. The player won the roll and narrated the monkey having one too many banana daquiris, getting into a fight with his reflection, smashing up the bar and being thrown out into the street. It wasn't a strong plot point but it added tonnes of flavour.<br/><br/>In Fantasy GUMSHOE my character undertook a ritual without a key component, I fell short on the roll but had enough swine tokens to buy a success. I chose not to, this lead to us tracking a dragon to its lair, an epic fight during which the thief nicked all the treasure and lots of good story.<br/><br/>In Hillfolk, Robin Laws' new game, in a drama scene you can accept the other player's deal and you get a token. Once you've got enough tokens, you can force a deal on someone. Failure is definitely a reward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
