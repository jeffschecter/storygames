I'm new to Story Games but I figure I'll introduce myself and my game Ember.  This post is about Ember's setting, something I've been working on for about 6 years now and would love some outside opinions on.  Ember is a labor of love but I've reached the point where I'm burning out and I hope that some other viewpoints and encouraging words will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n"There was a time when the world of Ember was at peace, when the false gods ruled over the mortal races and gave to each of them a divine duty.  Ranick, king of the gods, directed humanity to build and protect the temples of the gods.  Edenia, goddess of law and order, directed the T'jal to guard the peace of the world as diplomats and traders.  Asherys, the god of life, directed the cat-like Oubri to guard and encourage all the life that existed in the world.  Dakren, the god of death, directed the Sulvai to comfort the mourning and shepherd the souls of the dead to him.  For millennia there was order and prosperity until a great war broke out and the mortal nations struggled for their very survival.<br/>\n<br/>\nA group of human nobles rebelled against their king, seeking to seize control and build their own kingdoms in what is known as the Lords' Rebellion.  Traitors emerged within all the races to follow their example, even the Chancellor of the T'jal nation was eventually exposed for dealings with rebellious forces in exchange for safety from their aggression.  It seemed that there was no hope for the mortal races, their gods had abandoned them to death and suffering.  There seemed to be no end to this path of madness and death that the world had been set upon, until the truth was found in the ruins of ancient temples by heroes seeking artifacts of great power to save their homes.  The gods were deceivers, powerful wizards who had enslaved the true goddess of Ember countless ages ago and used her power to elevate themselves to godhood.  Manipulating the mortal races as playthings, they had been the ones who urged the dissident nobles to rally and attack all for the sake of their own entertainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one knows who was involved or what exactly transpired, but through much hardship a group of heroes found the goddess shackled in chains forged by ancient forgotten magic that none among them could break.  She begged them to take her life so that her children could finally be free, persisting until they realized there was no choice, she could not be released and as long as she was alive the false gods' power would be unending.  The goddess was slain and the false gods suddenly found themselves robbed of their godhood and made mortal again, their lives ending under the vengeful charge of their former slaves.  Their power was still great even without that of the goddess and with their dying breath each cursed the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanick cursed the world to flame, the mortal races fled to any safe place they could find as fire rained from the sky and set the world ablaze  The ash that remained has never washed away and sometimes the ground still bursts into flames as if punishing what dares to grow.  Edenia cursed the T'jal with paranoia and greed that they might never unite successfully.  Asherys cursed the animals and plants that survived the fires to be twisted by mutation and disease.  Dakren's curse remains a mystery to all but the Sulvai even now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe races scattered to their respective homes, cowering and trying to scrape out a living from whatever remained as the age of devastation began.  Oblivion seemed a certainty, what food could grow was poison or inedible and the livestock were slowly becoming deformed or diseased as Asherys' curse took effect.  Finally the Rassek, a lizard-like race who were once hunted as blasphemers, emerged from their hidden cities in the South bearing gifts for the other mortal races, powerful magical items created by their priests that they called Remnants.  Large shimmering orbs that pulsed with powerful magic while arcane energy flared and sparked within them, they are the only thing in the world that can keep the curses of Asherys and Ranick at bay, though they seem unable to affect the curses of Dakren and Edenia.  The remnants varied in power and the areas outside of their reach were still fully under the effects of the curses, but they allowed crops to grow and animals to be raised free of disease and mutation within their influence.  Those areas that were not protected came to be known as the Burning Lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Humanity is fractured and at war with itself, those few well-meaning leaders who remain are constantly under attack by warlords and savages who seek to steal their lands, their remnants, or simply wish to destroy.  The T'jal fight a constant war for supremacy between city-states, their powerful merchant families hiring mercenaries to do the dirty work while they revel in wealth and luxury.  The Oubri now call themselves the Ashen Claws, their remnant allows much of their jungle to grow healthy once again, but their Elders struggle constantly for power against the Circle, a group of xenophobic zealots who seek to protect their jungle at absolutely any cost.  The Sulvai are only unified race, having rallied under one republic, their agenda as much a mystery as their culture.  Finally there are the Rassek who tentatively travel the world once more, hoping to restore their proper place and perhaps even the goddess herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever forget children that we live in a devastated world by our own actions, we traded comfort for freedom and only by losing your own freedom will you ever know how easy the choice was.  Do not look to the past for there are too many lies along that path to trip upon, instead look to the future and find a new path for yourself and your people.  Do not surrender to despair and desperation, instead cling to what may be, for there is always hope."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153762/#Comment_153762" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T22:53:08+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 10:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well know i now what happened in your campeign setting, you care to cough up a little bit more about about what your setting is about. Is it all about reclaiming lost glory or dealing with the reprecussions of your ancestors or what not, or whatever it is really about.  (what i got so far is that its a post apocolyptic, non tolkien traditional high fantasy... which may or may not be your mark) <br/>\n<br/>\nalso what if any system did you cast eyes upon for a basis of your setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear more , and Thanks for taking the time and effort to share and make this. It ain't easy and i appreciate it.

The game is set long enough after the cataclysmic events that the players are basically the first adult generation of the new world, they've got the opportunity to go out into this dark new world and perhaps make things better or maybe just make their own lives better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as system I've tried for something simple and taken a lot of inspiration from White Wolf and another game by the name of Ironclaw's system.  Mine's a basic stat/skill based roll of the dice system with higher being better.  Magic is something I've added some complexity to by making it dangerous to practice but that's a much longer explanation than I have time to post right now lol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153987/#Comment_153987" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T19:22:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's a nice intro.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey way most the games I try and play work, you could just plop that intro down and have everyone read it, then put out a page or two of rules allowing players to make up their races and connections to King Ranick as you go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fascinating bit is that "nobody knows what happened," usually, in a story game, this gives you a clue that the players get to make up what happened over the course of play. Was it a truly heroic event? Was it, instead, some kind of con job? If you're a normal person in the game world (one of "the races," we'll say) and you're hearing these legends, how blown out of porportion are they? Hopefully, the players will decide that over the course of play and the mechanics will encourage them to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely cannot help with White Wolf or Iron Claw mechanics, because they're kind of anathema to me. Sorry. I'd chuck 'em and just go with something simple.<br/>\nAs much as you've concentrated on the background so far, I'd reccommend using it to give the players something to spring board off of instead of something to pin them down.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's see, the elements you presented in the opening legend of the game present us with these ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe races were scattered to their respective homes: this says to me "create your race and its home, how does this define you? what benefits does it give you? here's a budget of dice/points/bonuses to expend on that."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got a good list of background societies/races:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ashen Claws<br/>\nThe Elders<br/>\nThe Circle<br/>\nThe T'Jal<br/>\nThe Sulvai <br/>\nThe Rassek<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, you might think about doing something like Puppetland, here, using those races to define several characteristics the players will want to have:<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you as mechanically-inclined as a T'Jal? Craftier? Clumsier?<br/>\nAre you as lithe as one of the Ashen Claws? More Lithe? Less?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of thing. I really don't know what you had in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/headtripgames" title="headtripgames"><img alt="headtripgames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/headtripgames">headtripgames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154010/#Comment_154010" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T20:42:21+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  8:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments Arpie, though the world is vastly more fleshed out than that, I wish I had the room to put everything down but it's like 50 pages of text on just setting fluff so I would officially leap past the title of spammer to something far more sinister that is yet to be named.  I don't know what the etiquette on Story Games is as far as what needs contracts and what doesn't and such but I'm very much interested in finding some people to read my rough draft before I send it to editing.  It is ready to go for people to read, all that's missing are some spells and some creature statistics but I think I might be lazy and let player groups design those for me since they'll tear apart whatever I write anyways lol.  Your comments however remind me of another project of mine called Gods Gone Wild so if you see me toss a post for that up here I hope you read it because I think it's more in tune with your play style.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for anyone else who reads this, if you're interested in reading the rough draft of Ember and giving me your opinion on it please leave me a message here with a means to contact you or email me at headtripgames@hotmail.com with subject line Ember Rough Draft or something to that effect.  Thanks in advance, I've tried to find people on Forge but so far haven't had much luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154013/#Comment_154013" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T20:51:21+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  8:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2008 8:52PM by Arpie.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it sounds like you're looking for an editor more than someone to give you new ideas?<br/>\nThat's cool.<br/>\nGood luck with that.

I just want people to read it and tell me what they think, what's good, bad, missing, unnecessary, etc, especially in the setting.
