An AP example: <br/><br/>There's a talking gorilla asking to be let out of a cage. I have a bunch of kids with me. Ruffians come in, stating they will kill the kids and me. I decide to let the gorilla out, and self-compel my "Optimistic to a fault" aspect.<br/><br/>If the GM doesn't want to have the decision screw me over, should I get a Fate point?<br/><br/>EDIT: P.S.: Is there an Evil Hat forum?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87382/#Comment_87382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T16:15:03+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  4:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Screw you over" isn't the criteria for a payout.  Constrain a choice is the technical one, and "make things more interesting" is the realistic one.  The rub is how _you_ see how the two things relate.  Letting out the gorilla is, sure, dangerous, but you're already facing a bunch of ruffians, depending upon genre and tone, releasing the wild animals seems an entirely appropriate thing to do. So what is different between your situation and the situation of someone who, without an aspect involved, Is faced with the same choice? The answer to that is the answer to whether or not you get a Fate Point.<br/><br/>Now, I'm guessing the optimism here is "This is a bad plan, but I'm optimistic it will work, so I'll do it!"  That's a little shaky,  depending on how bad a plan it really is. If it really is such a bad plan that a hopeless optimist would do it, then you're golden.  If it's just risky, but a choice between two bad situations, that's more practical and less optimistic.<br/><br/>Now, were it me GMing I would _not_ reward it for letting the gorilla out. However, since you'd flagged your optimism, I would offer a chip and ask, "Is the Gorilla your friend? Is he on your team? Think you should stay and cheer him on?"  That's a choice, and yes, it may make your life more complicated when the gorila takes you back into the cage to feed you grubs, and your friends need to get you out, but there's a straighter line from optimism to making the story turn  than simple optimism making trouble.  <br/><br/>Any clearer?<br/><br/>And there's a yahoo group: <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/FateRPG/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/FateRPG/</a><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87384/#Comment_87384" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T16:19:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  4:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd give you the fate point because if I have a talking gorilla confront you asking to be let out of the cage that's probably what I want you to do.  If I was smart, I'd be planning to compel your 'Optimistic to a fault' aspect to suggest, 'let him out, what could happen?'  and your self compel just beat me to the punch.  In general, I'll award fate points if the characters' actions are in accord with the aspect regardless of the potential danger or complication.  If the action moves the plot in an interesting way, or moves the plot along towards a scene I'm hoping to get to, or if the player doesn't really know what might happen as a result, that's enough.  I'll even award a fate point if a player chooses a course of action and justifies the choice based on an aspect--even if there's no real difference in risk between the courses af action.  So, back to the gorilla example, I'd award a fate point for any of the reasons above--maybe I wanted you to, it's certainly interesting for a gorilla to be loose chatting up the locals and crediting you for its freedom, and you've justified your action based on an aspect.   Heck, the gorilla may even save you from the ruffians...but then who's going to save you from the gorilla?<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87392/#Comment_87392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T16:35:43+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  4:35PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, both of you.
