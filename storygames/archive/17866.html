What games do you think do the best job of encouraging the players to work as a team to overcome obstacles?</blockquote>\nwww.starshipvalkyrie.com<br/><br/>The website is crap right now, but he's spending the next several months finishing an overhaul of the rulebook, which he's then intending to publish, as far as I know.<br/><br/>It's a work-together sci fi larp in a setting that is about 75% Star Trek and 25% Battlestar Galactica. For about 12-20 players at a time with about 3-4 people GMing and playing NPCs (or more, if you've got em).<br/><br/>And it's the most amazing leadership training / teambuilding exercise / communication simulation type thing I've ever done. It creates a tense but fun situation where good leadership technique really matters, but with an abstract gamey situation that makes it easier to analyze where things are going well and where they are breaking down.<br/><br/>With just the tiniest bit of work to add in actual technique training and reflection, it would be a really neat corporate teambuilding product.<br/><br/>I've spent 7 game sessions now as the captain of one of the ships, and it's been amazing to see how much a team of empowered subgroups can accomplish when given positive, supportive, and minimalist guidance. More than half the captaining work I do is in selecting who is going to be invited to play on my ship in the first place and talking to people outside of the game sessions to get everyone on the same page upfront. During the games, I tend to have my XO and Tactical Officer make most of the decisions, while I supervise and occasionally give a little nudge here and there. Trying out leadership techniques in a low-consequence environment has given me tremendous confidence in my ability to lead in the workplace.</blockquote>Really interesting post, Rob!

What I should have said is that it is a system and structure with tons and tons of potential to be used as a leadership training practice environment.<br/><br/>My current success comes from my own interest in leadership techniques and practices. I've spent the past 9 years of work life as a technical writer, primarily as a contract worker for a year or so at a time at different places. So I've worked with some managers who were amazing and many who were lacking, and I've seen patterns of good and bad behavior that I've tried to learn from. And I've done some project management and business process analysis at various times, so I have an professional interest both in how I manage a project and in how others manage processes.<br/><br/>Christian Brown, who runs Starship Valkyrie as a full-time (but shoestring) business, offers some advice to the various ship captains to make sure they make use of their section heads effectively. He points out that managing the communication stream is vital to success and suggests to captains that they insist that people report to the XO so that the XO can handle easy decisions while the captain struggles with the harder ones. And he always has an after game talk, but the talk is more focused on letting people share what happened during the game rather than on analyzing how the leadership and communicated worked or didn't work.<br/><br/>If he was tuning the experience to present it as a corporate leadership training and teambuilding exercise, then he would need to frontload the leadership training part more. Ideally you'd want to do it as 2 half-day things, but more likely it would just be one all-day event. So the morning would be spent training on communication and leadership techniques along with learning the game mechanics, then break for lunch, then play the game in the afternoon, followed by the post game discussion. It would be pretty darn neat as an experience.<br/><br/>As for what the team of GMs are doing, most of their effort is on facilitating the game mechanics and providing the challenge for the players.<br/><br/>One of the GMs runs the "display" - the tactical map of space. They place enemies on the display according to a combination of time and event triggers (and a bit of fudge factor based on how things are doing - if things are going too smoothly they might add an extra baddie here or there).<br/><br/>Another GM runs the starfighter combat game. There's a separate scaled-in map that is used for the starfighters with it's own movement and firing rules. Most of the bad guys do some sort of thing where they send out a squad of maybe 20 drone fighters at a time (more or less depending on how tough they are) and the starfighter pilots engage with them and shoot them down. If they're in trouble, sometimes the main ship can fire into that combat to help out, so there's some communication that happens there.<br/><br/>A third GM runs the "other stuff". In many scenarios there is something else happening - psychic energy beings are mind controlling some of the crew members and the GM is handing them cards telling them how to react. Things like that. Sometimes this is a couple staffers playing NPCs that we are trying to ally or trade or protect/transport or otherwise interact with.<br/><br/>So mostly the GMs are providing lots of different stuff to different players to react to. When you've got over a dozen players and they're getting different inputs, then figuring out what all is going on and how to address it is a big challenge. And that's typically the main point of the game - to identify the core issues in a sea of information and put together a plan of action to address them. The GMs' task is to create that sea of information.<br/><br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_404332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404332/#Comment_404332" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T15:09:31+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  3:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It clarifies things a bit, yes.

"How do I deal with a reluctant player" parallels the classic manager issue "How do I deal with a reluctant employee." And much advice about how to be a good GM is advice about how to be a good leader. Explain your expectations and make it clear how you will react in regards to those expectations. Be consistent and fair. These are the things we tell GMs and leaders both.<br/><br/>With the majority of tabletop games, the path to practice leadership techniques is to be a GM.<br/><br/>Though I agree that the caller position in original D&amp;D was a player-side example of a leadership position. I think that was there because early games tended to have more players than is most commonly done nowadays.<br/><br/>I would say, broadly speaking, that there are more opportunities in larp for players to practice leadership. And that's usually a matter of size (# of concurrent players in the same game). In larger games, where it is common for the players to break up into factions, those factions often revolve around player leadership positions which may or may not be built in to the system itself.<br/><br/>The Darkon movie talks about player faction leadership and learning leadership skills while doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_404488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404488/#Comment_404488" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T23:30:15+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 11:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 11:32PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the three basic tasks for a GM are:<br/>- building trust between yourself and the player<br/>- building and maintaining a positive mood amongst the players<br/>- resolving conflicts in a friendly and firm manner<br/><br/>If these are dealt with in a good manner, I find it easy to manage the interaction, helping players in producing fiction of high quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407687/#Comment_407687" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T10:03:37+00:00" title="March  1, 2013 10:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2013 10:05AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is awesome.

It uses dispersed roles and responsibilities in a framework where teamwork is essential (as opposed to, for example, an MMO raid where the essential nature of the teamwork is more fragile and it's easier for someone to go all Leeroy Jenkins).<br/><br/>I would argue, though, that the faster action nature of the game makes it lend itself less well to thoughtful analysis of the effectiveness of leadership and communication. It's really tempting to just rush from one death to the next without spending a lot of time figuring out what to do differently.<br/><br/>But if you wanted a game to use to focus on effective small group communication and to practice those skills, Artemis would be excellent for that. It forces 6 people to work together effectively in order to be successful. <br/><br/>And if you committed yourself to going through some "What did we do well? What can we improve on for next round?" type questions after each round, then it would be neat as leadership/communication training.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407734/#Comment_407734" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T15:40:39+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  3:40PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Key of the Commander in Lady Blackbird really got me into playing a leadership role.
