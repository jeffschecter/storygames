I'd encourage people to post encouragement and ideas if you are keen on something, as this might help get it moving. (This would certainly help me on mine.)<br/><br/>Sci-Fi Poison'd sounds great. We played Warhammer 40K pirates using Poison'd for a one shot (an episode from the PCs enemies for our Rogue Trader campaign) and it worked brilliantly, so I'd love to see something like this.<br/><br/>I think there are a number of issues here that can make hacks different from full games:<br/>- Lower bar to entry in writing a hack may encourage more people with less experience (which is good, but may mean less finished product);<br/>- People may be more likely to write hacks to play rather than publish, so they dry up once that campaign is finished or may have rules gaps that are understood at the table that the designer can't be bothered writing out;<br/>- IP concerns, as you are using someone else's work to leverage off; and<br/>- Smaller potential fan base, as they may need to own/like the original game first to get into the hack (as mentioned above with Terminator Grey Ranks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325649/#Comment_325649" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T19:19:03+00:00" title="May 21, 2011  7:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The subforums aren't really a great example. If you're hack needed more than a single thread, it seemed to get a subforum - somewhat to Vincent's chagrin. <br/><br/>However, Monsterhearts and Dungeon World are the two excellent games that came from out of the Barf Forth hack forums and I would say that they are both successful if not quite finished (yet). These are followed by  Goblin World, Dead Weight, Minions Inc., Saga of the Icelanders, Source Code, Bulwark, Monster of the Week, and Fingers in the Firmament; all of which are in various states of completion. All of them are in play(test)able states if you have Apocalypse World and no fear of filling in the gaps. Which means that while some of the forums are inactive, more that half of them are successes or yet-to-be successful as hacks, with Dungeon World soon becoming a stand-alone game.<br/><br/>I agree with John that one tends to abandon most ideas one comes up with but that's simply part and parcel of the creative process.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned almost everyone hacks, drifts or house-rules almost all the RPGs they play, sometimes unintentionally.<br/><br/>I would say that they aren't successful in the way you mean because they are meant as contextual fixes or translations for what are ultimately universal designs. That context, like everyone's been saying, is typically local to a single gaming group. Sometimes it's more, and very, very rarely it breaks out - but that act of 'breaking' out and becoming popular makes it successful but at the same time it not longer is a hack. Like, D&amp;D hasn't been a hack of Chainmail for a long time now.<br/><br/>Man, I gotta knock it off with the dialects. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325674/#Comment_325674" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T08:54:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  8:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The AW Forum issue is partially the fault of the people who get too excited about their hack, request a forum from Vincent (which is the way you get one), and then don't have enough sustainable activity to really make a subforum meaningful. Certainly I'm guilty of that with Firmament.  Honestly, my other AW hack, Ghost Opera, is likely to be in a playable state first, but I haven't bothered to request a forum for specifically that reason.<br/><br/>Most game design ends in either limited play (design for a particular session or campaign) or just getting used as building blocks and fodder for future design and play.  After all, the point of Game Chef isn't actually to produce good games.  The purpose is for participants to have the experience of designing a game, which is beneficial to future play and design even if they don't finish or the game turns out to be terrible.  Hacks are the natural starting point for design, since you can build on things you already like.  That makes them easier in some cases, but they still take some follow through and persistence to finish and, even then, nobody may care but you, just like any other bit of design work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325682/#Comment_325682" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T12:35:38+00:00" title="May 22, 2011 12:35PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard RPG strikes me as a hack of Burning Wheel, and it's alive and kickin'...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325692/#Comment_325692" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T14:25:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  2:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would really appreciate it if people did more retrospection on their hacks and less frenzied anticipation and prep.

In my mind, it means a game clearly derrived from a single other game, a variation rather than something that's more its own standalone thing.  So the distinction between "hack" and "unique, other game" is vague by design.<br/><br/>It's also come to refer to the verb, "hacking" a game together from the parts of several other games, Ghost/Echo and Lady Blackbird being the earliest prominent advocates of this style of game design that I can think of.  Other games were assembled this way before, but haven't openly suggested this kind of design approach in the way John's games did, I think.<br/><br/>Note that, according to these general concepts, a game that's "hacked" together is not necessarily a "hack."

Even back to Chainmail?)<br/>- Original design, but with some ideas from other games<br/>- Original design with some elements borrowed from other games<br/>- ...<br/>- Complex house rules for an existing system<br/>- Simple house rules for an existing system <br/>- An existing system played straight (never actually seen this either?)<br/><br/>You'll have to fill in the "..." above in your head, but I think the point is clear without me typing the whole thing.

Say there's a hack of Dogs in the Vineyards for a Supernatural game, it's tweaked some stuff to account for the fact that Sam &amp; Dean don't give two shits about Mormon Religion, and some monsters have been statted out. You'd still need DitV to play it. It might at some point get released as its own thing. This would be similar to Counterstrike, which originally required Half-Life to play, but then was so popular that it got re-released as its own game.<br/><br/>Arms Law and Spell Law originally required D&amp;D to run, but they were popular enough that Rolemaster got released. That's what I'm thinking at least when I hear hack. It's an add on for a game that you already have, and then you perform the same hack that someone else did. <br/><br/>Otherwise I'm thinking it's just a derivative. Vampire: The Masquerade is obviously a derivative of Shadowrun (for mechanics) and Anne Rice novels (for theme), I don't think anyone would call it a hack though.

I can't think of too much within the Story Games scene but there are many in the OGL scene that are moderately successful (selling in the 300-1,000+ range). <br/><br/>So to answer the original question, "Has a hack ever been truly successful?" I would say that in almost every definition of the word hack in this thread, the answer is yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
