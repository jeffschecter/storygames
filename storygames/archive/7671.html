That card is your character, by this key:<br/><i><br/><b>Clubs </b>= servant or thief/robber, adventurous, social mode: servile or rascal<br/><b>Hearts </b>= peasant or craftsman, traditional and amorous, social mode: rustic<br/><b>Spades </b>= guard or trader, materialistic, social mode: civil or strongly hierarchic<br/><b>Diamonds </b>= noble or hero, idealistic and grand, social mode: noblesse oblige<br/>- The value of the card tell you how high the character is placed in his/her social strata.<br/>- A face-card signifies that the character is a well know and/or significant person.</i><br/><br/>When all players have drawn a card for their character, then you create <i>the troupe</i>, by making relations between the characters according to their stature. A servant-character will be a <i>servant </i>to a noble, f.x. Make relations that makes it natural for the characters to stay together.<br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>Play</b></span></span><br/><br/>Then you draw a card to set the first scene:<br/><i><br/><b>Clubs </b>= you are in dire straits: a gang of robbers have surrounded you on the highway<br/><b>Hearts </b>= you arrive at the ball, and in the entrance you see the daughter of the house, more beautiful than a star!<br/><b>Spades </b>= you have recently fallen from grace, and are now in the chain-gang building a castle for an evil landlord<br/><b>Diamonds </b>= your torches lit up the cave, and the mountain of gold laying there: THE TREASURE IS YOURS!!!<br/></i>Any player may state an intent, and may follow up on his intent if no opposition is offered. He then tell how his character fulfills his intent. Try to limit your intent. Do not go for full marriage at once (se the last paragraph of the rules), but state that you need to make an impression on the beautiful lady standing in the entrance. By doing things in steps you give the other players the chance to make your ride towards happiness more interesting (and possibly a lot more thorny ;-)<br/><br/>If any other player claim that opposition is present, either by his own character or the surroundings or an NPC, then he may tell how the intention is opposed, and draw a card. If it's a black card he interprets it, making the opposition the winner of the conflict. If it's a red card he gives it to the other player to interpret, giving the victory to his character.<br/><br/>Here is how the cards reads in conflicts:<br/><i><br/><b>Clubs </b>= the conflict escalates into violence, or veers off in a destructive direction<br/><b>Hearts </b>= the conflict resolves to your advantage, in an amiable manner<br/><b>Spades </b>= the conflict may be resolved, but you will have to work hard for it <b>*</b> <br/><b>Diamonds </b>= the conflict resolves to your advantage, but it cost you<br/>- The value of the card tell the players how heavy the consequence is.<br/>- If the drawn card is a face-card, the conflict (or the solution of it) will include another person.<br/><b>*</b> The work: draw a new card to see what kind of "work" the conflict demands. Interpret the card to make tough "work" for the character.</i><br/><br/><b>New scenes</b><br/>New scenes may be set by a player when he is telling you all how a conflict resolves, or you may agree on what scene is most likely (or fun) to play as follow up. But you may may draw cards to set new scenes in the game too. If you choose to do so, the player drawing the card will describe a scene for you all. Use this for inspiration:<br/><i><br/><b>Clubs </b>= there may be violence in this laden situation<br/><b>Hearts </b>= oh, sweet romance, this has to be one of those moments<br/><b>Spades </b>= you have to work hard to make a soft and silky bed, or to make your daily bread<br/><b>Diamonds </b>= commerce and power and clever schemes ...<br/>- The value of the card tell the players how important the scene is. Some small scenes are good for building your character. ;-)<br/>- If the drawn card is a face-card, the scene will be directly related to the higher goal of a player character.</i><br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>Your goal and the end</b></span></span><br/><br/>During the intial phases of the game you should be on the lookout for a higher goal your character will strive towards. If you find the higher goal of your character, you will halt play and take a stance, giving a speech on how and why your character will strive for this goal. Don't be afraid to be pompous! Romanticize your goal and hold it up as a magnificent ideal! The other players may give their support to your quest, or they may tell you that their characters oppose it (they must tell you all if the opposition is open or hidden).<br/><br/>If any player reaches his goal the game goes to the end-scene. The end scene takes place in a tavern or inn, with the characters gathered around the table, in conversation. This conversation is set to a suitable time after the conclusion of the drama, letting you all play out how the conclusion affected you and your relationships.<br/><br/>The end-scene ends with the lucky player taking a stance again. Once more he lifts his voice, but this time he delivers praise for his friends, and good advice for them. He may even indulge in some blatant bragging of his own heroism/ingenuity/luck. The other players may cheer the character/player, nod sagely to any advice he deigns to give, and lift their mugs in a final salute!<br/><br/>And then all may give thanks to each other for having had a nice game together.<br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>Have a nice game!</b></span></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_170409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170409/#Comment_170409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T16:54:52+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  4:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This little game was conceived under influence of the thread on card-RPGs for the pub, by Ryan Stoughton.

But when someone pulled a joker, they had to connect their next scene to the last scene that was played.<br/><br/>But you could use jokers in reverse to have flashback or soliloquy scenes, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171559/#Comment_171559" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:22:08+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For collecting cards:<br/><br/>Well, as you play, when your character is successful, you collect red cards. When you are successful in providing opposition to other characters (kind of GM-like), you collect black cards.<br/><br/>So it seems like collecting those cards should be good for something, either with future conflicts, or in terms of developing your character. For instance, collecting Hearts means you're making more and more friends or connections. Maybe you can play them in the future to call on those friends? On the other hand, if you're collecting Spades, it means you're creating a lot of violent opposition. Maybe, in some karmic way, that means your character is either more likely to face violence (cards in your hand can be played against you) or to use violent means to achieve goals (you can play cards in your hand to reverse a bad outcome, but must go through with the drawback on the card).<br/><br/>Definitely, the should have something to do with whether you achieve your character's main goal or not. Those cards could also be played to frame scenes, or to create conflicts for other characters--so, with a hand full of spades, you can create violent opposition for others. Heck, maybe you achieve your goal if you can get rid of all your cards.<br/><br/>Just thinking outloud, here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
