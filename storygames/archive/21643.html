You can do whatever you want that makes sense within the fiction. The rules only say "hey when this certain thing happens it triggers this mechanic" <br/><br/>I just think this is so important for cultivating the type of gameing that excites me. And in games where the inverse is true, I think this "the rules don't say you can do that" methodology contributes so much towards turning a lot of people away from the hobby.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there's a more precise term for it. It's just something that stuck with me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473476/#Comment_473476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T03:30:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  3:30AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What games are you talking about that are fraught with "the rules don't say you can do that" methodology?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473477/#Comment_473477" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T03:54:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  3:54AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that the sort of gaming I grew up with, namely D&amp;D, shadowrun, Pathfinder, had this sort of problem in my experience. <br/><br/>A lot of folks on this forum have pointed out this is a problem with practice and culture rather than rules as written.

But what you're describing sounds more like cultural behavior.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there couldn't be something about some games you've played that attract or otherwise enable that type of culture - and that's an interesting topic to me even though I don't know where to begin to analyze that.

In this case when does the fiction and the mechanics interact but more specifically as a player of a game from where do I start when making an active decision for a character I'm role playing.<br/><br/>For the D&amp;D Pathfinder example, you would definitely approach a class with the idea in mind that my class abilities are what my character can do, that's it. (Now that may not be strictly true but I definitely think it's how a lot of people approach it and the game encourages that through design I think) <br/><br/>Versus something like apocalypse world where you do have a Playbook that resembles a class but the elements that make up that Playbook are largely fictional triggers that correspond to archetypal genre situations as well as tightly focused character drama prompts. <br/><br/>When I first started designing my apocalypse World hack one of the things I had to stop doing was thinking of lots and lots of abilities to be listed. I had to ask myself the question "couldn't they already do this?" Or even, "is this element driving anything fictionally or being driven by something fictionally?" Stuff on a Playbook isn't only stuff you're going to be doing per say, it's more like a que to the GM and the player of the types of conflicts they're interested in. <br/><br/>This may not be a profound realization for other people but for me it was a big deal a big paradigm shift in thinking and I still can't fully articulated the way that feels right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473484/#Comment_473484" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T05:17:22+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  5:17AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want my<br/>I want my<br/>I want my mtp\u2665<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473486/#Comment_473486" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T05:49:25+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  5:49AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For the D&amp;D Pathfinder example, you would definitely approach a class with the idea in mind that my class abilities are what my character can do, that's it.

It's also probably a 'softer' phenomenon than the post implies.<br/><br/>This is not simply a "culture of play" thing, or rather, it is, but that culture flows directly from the rules in a lot of cases, but not necessarily in a clear "the rules say <i>this</i>" kind of way.  Oftentimes it flows from the things the rules imply instead. <br/><br/>A lot D&amp;Dfinder style games have a lot of rules for the penalties and difficulties inherent in doing stuff.  So when a GM who has read a lot of rules about "Okay, doing this is a -2, and doing that is a DC 15 athletics check." and nothing much about giving bonuses outside the scope of what the rules say, you end up with the player who says "Can I jump up onto the table, grab the chandelier rope, swing across the room and slash my sword at the Duke?" and the GM who responds, "Well, yes, that'll be a Jump check (DC 12), an athletics check (DC 15) and give you -2 to hit."  So the player responds with "I guess I'll just use my feat that lets me charge without provoking opportunity attacks" because the rules have implicitly told him that while he COULD do the other thing, doing the thing that the rules EXPLICITLY tells him how to do produces better results.<br/><br/>So it's not necessarily that rules tell you that you CAN'T do  but rather that they make it more advantageous to only "do what's on your character sheet." because those levers give you clear defined "permission" and feedback, while the rest of the game seems to have been designed to make everything difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473529/#Comment_473529" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T14:15:46+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  2:15PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great point                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473533/#Comment_473533" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T14:39:53+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  2:39PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Airk<br/><br/>Mechanics for PC action shouldn't be so rigid about what the character can do.

For the record I do agree that it doesn't have to be that way, but I'm interested in the parts of the game are framed signal to the player which things are possible.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473538/#Comment_473538" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T14:53:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  2:53PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I want my<br/>I want my<br/>I want my mtp\u2665<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\nWat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473542/#Comment_473542" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T15:08:03+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  3:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2018 3:09PM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magical Tea Party (it was easy to find in the dictionary)<br/>"I'll play the Mad Hatter, you'll be Alice.

But that's subtle and not the biggest culprit (and perhaps ISNT the culprit just something I noticed), I think Airk said it best as players aren't always rewarded in the same way when they don't interact with the rules explicitly.
