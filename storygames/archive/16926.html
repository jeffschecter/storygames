Meanwhile if I take a chance on a kickstarter, the money never leaves my account unless it funds.  So, if you're tight on funds, the difference is pretty significant.  If it were on kickstarter, I'd probably have put down $10 on each of them, on the assumption that they're not all going to fund, but they might, but on indiegogo my account is out $190 if I do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385677/#Comment_385677" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-24T08:10:06+00:00" title="July 24, 2012  8:10AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly that!

Better for the folks involved to try again, using a better setup. <br/><br/>It's important for people to try new things with these new tools (like having a bunch of $6,000 campaigns all going at once, I guess), but that sometimes means it doesn't work.

In the worst case you're out a few week's use of the money you put in, which really doesn't mean anything unless you're literally choosing between eating and buying some rpg books. No reason whatsoever to not put in the money in your favourite project even if it doesn't seem likely to fund, as long as the price seems right from your viewpoint.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the more probable reason for not participating here is old-fashioned comparison shopping: there are a lot of D&amp;D adventures out there, so for a given project to attract your money it'd have to be more interesting or affordable than the next thing. Many people have already put their money in, indicating that for them these projects qualify. Many have not, perhaps because the price is pretty high compared to buying similar products off the shelf, or because they've not been particularly convinced about the quality of the product on offer. It's certainly true that many D&amp;D-gamers don't even use adventure modules, so the numbers participating here might be considered even pretty good in comparison to some other projects that have involved products of wider interest.<br/><br/>Many people I've talked about this with have been pretty cold-blooded about it: the budgets are large for adventure modules (never mind the production quality, not everybody is in it for professional artwork) and the prices are at least as high as they will be in ordinary retail. As long as you're not completely taken by an individual module, it makes as much sense to wait and perhaps purchase the adventure later at retail price. I can certainly sympathize with this: I know that I enjoy adventure modules and would find all of these projects worthwhile, but I'm not sufficiently taken by any of them to pay a premium to get them made. There's a huge amount of D&amp;D adventure modules out there that I've yet to check out, I don't need to pay to have more produced.<br/><br/>Despite the above points, it is true what Jonathan says, the campaign structure here is remarkably quirky as well. If an equivalent amount of money (a bit over $20k at this writing) had been collected by a single campaign in the model of the earlier hardcover reprint thing (which definitely had its own problems), I'd already be investing myself, as the bundle deals would begin to make financial sense around this scale. Depending on the number of similarly analytic customers, it's possible that reaching such a tipping point might bring in a significant amount of funding from people who are interested, but not sufficiently to join in before the price point becomes competitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
