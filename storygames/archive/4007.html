I pored over the stack the other night after work, and sampled broadly.  Some really groovy stuff here, and I'm digging the "rules are 90% done" approach, the designer notes, and the invitation to participate in a conversation.<br/><br/>So there I am with my stack of new games, reading the first chapters of each, and skimming.  But Acts of Evil, by Paul Czege, was caprivating, and instead of stopping after the first chapter, I read it through in one sitting.  It's an amazing rulebook.  The rules seem to be interlocking and sophisticated, and they are expressed thematically.  The text is rich, sometimes dense; it presents the rules as they are, and constantly invites you to consider the implications.  It's obvious to me that only through AP will I really understand it.<br/><br/>I wish the game had a brief web page describing what it is, and its elevator pitch.  Lacking that, I trust that it is permissible to quote briefly from the book (page 11), in which we have the closest thing to the elevator pitch: "[The players' story is] an unrecorded tale of cosmic ambition, magical clashes, impossible entities, and human pain hidden in the shadows of history. [...] Player characters in Acts of Evil are new initiates to an occult tradition devoted to [the] aggressive and competitive pursuit of personal godhood."<br/><br/>This is a game that, after just one reading and no AP, is damn hard to write about.  I can say that it's terribly fascinating in lots of ways, that each section and paragraph of the rules seems to be there for a reason, and there's a ton of stuff for your hind brain to chew on as your conscious mind keeps reading and flipping pages.  The author has his instruments out and is speaking to you as a peer, not as a consumer with kid gloves on -- and that's incredibly refreshing.<br/><br/>The settings (there are likely to be several) are chosen by the players during creation.  As the characters gain levels (there are three), the setting explodes to include all space and time.  And yet, there are a bunch of structural rules which suggest that the players' ability to make sense of, and not be paralyzed by, these vast degrees of creative freedom is not endangered.   Still, it's something that I'll be watching in my own AP.<br/><br/>The game premise is in full view, and the thrust of the rules unrelentingly presses you to do dark and horrible things to win the game.  The title makes perfect sense.  And when you consider that there is only 1 chance for 1 PC to make 1 attempt at the final battle against the heart of the mythos; win or lose, once 1 attempt is made, carnage ensues among the other PCs (though survival tactics are implied), and the game ends.  That took me a while to digest.  I can't wait to play this game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
