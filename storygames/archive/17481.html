I guess the breaking point for me was an 'epic' prestige class which, at one level, gave the character an extra 30 feet of darkvision. Not exactly earthshattering.<br/><br/>Since DW is my dungeoneering game of choice, I was wondering what form you thought Epic Dungeon World could take. <br/><br/>* Would it need any structural changes at all? There isn't the numerical escalation that there is in D&amp;D.<br/>* Would some numerical escalation be worthwhile?<br/>* Could you change the basic moves themselves, create a whole new epic suite of basic moves?<br/>* Would epic levels be better handled by compendium classes, or expanding the base classes?<br/>* Could you keep the current spell system, or would a build-your-own-ritual system like in 3E be a fun addition?<br/><br/>I'd love to see your thoughts on this!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395954/#Comment_395954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T16:51:44+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  4:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World lets you advance basic moves so they do something <i>really cool</i> if you roll 12+.

At just about level nine-ten, you get to build you own castle and have a standing army. Wizards start getting things like Meteor Swarm, which can hurt an army. Fighters get an actual army. The game if it goes on, switches to courtly politics and epic wars rather than dungeon crawls.

The Queen needs you to travel beyond the Black Gates of Death to bring back her King, who's soul has been taken by a terrible man who calls a demon his master. Make up some level-appropriate appropriate monsters, have your group travel the River Styx and fight out ghouls and spectres and worse, and make their way into the Obsidian Kingdom where they'll find the demon (or maybe just his mortal puppet) and the soul of the King. Bam, you could do that at first level. Maybe make up some appropriate badass custom moves, go all-out with descriptions of the place, encourage the PCs to act like the baddest asses in the realm, etc.<br/><br/>You can always take the Apocalypse World approach and have the Wizard be THE WIZARD TO END ALL WIZARDS, the only capital-W Wizard in all the worlds that are, and so on. The Fighter is literally THE FIGHTER, master of all forms of combat, brilliant tactician, grizzled veteran of a hundred wars. There are wizards and fighters, but they aren't protagonist-caliber (anti-)heroes.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Dungeon World doesn't need any modifications to be epic.

Keep them coming!<br/><br/>To those of you saying that DW is epic from the beginning, I think you're right that DW can be more easily made epic than, say, D&amp;D. I don't agree that DW is inherently epic or easily made epic, though. There'd be no point going to level 10 if level 1 fulfilled that need. Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to play high-level DW yet, but I suspect it feels different to low-level DW and I'd like to cultivate whatever it is that makes it feel different. \n<blockquote>Apocalypse World lets you advance basic moves so they do something <i>really cool</i> if you roll 12+.

But, you hit level 12 (11 exp needed) faster than you hit level 11 (17 exp needed.)  Is that intended?<br/><br/>Also, even a +4 in apocalypse world is really strange -- it makes it very difficult to ever roll a miss (1/36 chance,) and +5 means they will never roll a miss.  Even at a +3 it's pretty low, 3/36.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is, stat adjusting past +3 might be less fun?  Especially as the moves in DW tend not to have overtly negative repercussions on a 10+.<br/><br/>I really like your 12+ moves!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
