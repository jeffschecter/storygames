And Still Life by Wendy Gorman, David Hertz, and Heather Silsbee (from the Golden Cobra challenge) could be another example.<br/><br/>So, what techniques are games using to create that vibe?<br/><br/>In <i>Left Coast</i> (<a href="https://payhip.com/b/9vJI" rel="nofollow">payhip link</a>), I'm using two specific techniques. The first is to figure out what scene is next by letting the group decide who they want the protagonist to hang out with. Everyone names a supporting character (people can choose the same person), and the protagonist's player selects someone from that list. That gives the game a very natural, drifting feel.<br/><br/>The second technique is how to end a scene. <a href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">@Abstract_Machine</a> summed it up pretty well in <a href="https://akingdomis.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/left-coast/" rel="nofollow">their review</a>:\n<blockquote>The other great piece of the system is the double-knock on the table to end scenes. ... <i>Left Coast</i> encourages you to ramble on a bit. ... If one person knocks, they think the scene should end. The moment the second person knocks, the scene is over.<br/><br/>It\u2019s the best of both worlds: a collective edit with creative freedom for each and every player. Aggressive knocking could, of course, occur \u2013 but at least it\u2019s negotiable without breaking the flow of the story.</blockquote>\nI took that technique from <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow">Until We Sink</a>, a (I don't know the technical term) 'contained LARP' set on the patio of a tropical resort on an island that is slowly sinking into the sea. The game has 5-7 scenes, each of which take place at the end of successive days. I love this game, I love the conversations it produces. It ends scenes using this process:\n<blockquote>Every evening, conversation ends as soon as two characters have left the patio. You can declare that your character is leaving at any time (you yourself may remain in silence, listening to the others). Usually another character will leave at the same time or shortly after, so no one has to wait for very long.</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">@Coalhada</a>, what about your game (is it <i>Malandros</i>?)<br/><br/>Anyone else got examples of games that are doing this?<br/><br/><b>Edited to add the games that have been cited in this thread</b>: <i>Golden Sky Stories, Chuubo's Marvellous Wish-Granting Engine,\tSpione (manuevers), Imagine, Okult, The Shadow of Yesterday (refreshment scenes), The Tavern, Burning Empires (Color scenes), Ribbon Drive\t</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444987/#Comment_444987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-28T23:37:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2015 11:37PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Golden Sky Stories and Chuubo's Marvellous Wish-Granting Engine, at least based on my play experience, absolutely accomplish this.

The key bit is that it tells you that the point of Maneuvers (the phase of the game where players are just building fiction turn to turn) is to put the spies into The Cold.  The game defines The Cold as a wedge between the spy and their home agency.<br/><br/>That doesn't necessarily mean, a right here, right now conflict.  You will get to conflicts by doing this but that isn't the GOAL of Maneuvers which makes a big difference.<br/><br/>Since everyone can only contribute one bit of fiction on their turn during Maneuvers scene transitions are similarly smooth.

In every game I playtested here, the two-knock rule seemed to work fine and didn't set off our 'Am I being rude?' alarms. <br/><br/>The first knock is usually just a signal that it feels like we might be approaching the end. After that, the group is usually more invested in the details of the scene. They become more aware they need to 'achieve' anything they want to do in the scene, and they start collectively looking out for a good place to end it.<br/><br/>That time between the first and second knock is usually filled with pretty awesome or fun moments.<br/><br/>By the time the second knock happens, it's usually with group approval and a sense from everybody that it's time to end the scene. It's also not uncommon to have people say to the rest of the group, "I want to knock here. Is that going to be okay with everyone?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444994/#Comment_444994" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-29T09:19:49+00:00" title="April 29, 2015  9:19AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>: I've enjoyed reading <i>Okult</i> before.

When the last one is withdrawn, the scene ends. There are usually only 1-3 uninvolved players, so, in practice, it's similar to the "knocking" rule.<br/><br/>In unWritten, a player actually got a benefit (some kind of point/token) for ending someone else's scene, and it was called "buttoning" (a film-maker's jargon, I believe - the ability to spot a good dramatic spot to end a scene and cut to something else).<br/><br/>Cutting a scene is a great way to emphasize a decision, bit of foreshadowing, or, more typically, a particularly powerful line of dialogue.<br/><br/>(However, it's also arguably quite the opposite of "laid-back gaming"!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445000/#Comment_445000" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-29T15:22:57+00:00" title="April 29, 2015  3:22PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The earliest use of a consciously "laid-back" mechanism in a story game which really caught on that I can think of is "refreshment scenes" in The Shadow of Yesterday.

The story becomes a cavalcade of people relentlessly accomplishing stuff. <br/>Whereas the question to the scene-caller in <i>Malandros</i> is not so much "what do you want to do next?" as "what is your character up to now?"<br/><br/>Oddly enough, knowing that you can't have your go later seems to ease the pressure on the scene-caller somewhat. I think it's because where before it would be OK for someone to say "hey, can we do the scene where I try to get out of going to my dad's birthday party and we'll come back to your scene later?", everyone now knows that no, you can't.

To me, a double-knocking technique is a more democratic formalized way to do this: it's effectively a non-intrusive negotiation, and I'd expect it to be easier on everybody's feelings compared to most other ways to do it I know of ("one specific player has to end scenes" or "any player can choose to end a scene", with the more laid-back alternative being "unstructured consensus that the scene has served its purpose").<br/><br/>In my group - which I would promptly describe as "laid back" when compared to the style of play I can infer as the default from most American rulebooks - we're currently playing <i>Polaris</i>, specifically in the <i>Thou Art But a Warrior</i> setting. By the rules as written, either Heart of Infidel (Mistaken) can end a scene by uttering "And so it was." But in our group, I noticed that "And so it was\u2026?" is usually proffered in an interrogative tone, waiting for the other player to nod and confirm: "\u2026And so it was." This is no deliberate rules-hack on our part, it just came up spontaneously and - though we do from time to time remind each other that's not how it's supposed to work - we keep falling back into the habit. Since the habit is not game-disruptive at any rate (that we can perceive), we don't fight it hard, but rather let it be. It is, to us, the most natural and logical way that ritual phrase should work -- because we're more used, from a number of games we played together, to ending scenes by consensus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445046/#Comment_445046" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-01T02:00:08+00:00" title="May  1, 2015  2:00AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2015 12:30PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I guess I'll cover Golden Sky Stories, since I have a much more solid play experience with that than with Chuubo's. There's a few things that contribute to GSS' pastoral tone, and I'll try and parse them out.<br/><br/><b>The Setup</b><br/>From the getgo, GSS tells you to create situations that don't rely on conflict. As in, that's how it outlines scenario creation. You're supposed to keep heartwarming ideas, not conflict-filled ideas, and the game strictly tells you not to build scenarios with antagonists. I know it's not technically mechanics yet, but this actually goes a long way towards creating that feeling. It upends a lot of preconceptions that GMs have about scenario creation. How do you build a story without an antagonist?<br/><br/><b>The "Dreams" Mechanic</b><br/>Okay, so Dreams are fanmail. That's pretty straightforward. They're not the core of the tone engine, but they really grease the wheels. The book says "hand a dream when someone else does something sweet or cute". Sounds a little hokey, but it really works as a reinforcer of the mood.<br/><br/>They directly work with your characters' relationships. Your character's relationships to other people give one type of resource, other people's relationships to your character give another type of resource, and you increase relationships by investing Dreams.<br/><br/><b>The Powers</b><br/>In my opinion, this is where everything comes from. The setup provides context, the Dreams grease the wheels, but it's the characters' powers that really make everything work. For the one part, characters don't have dice involved; they can do pretty much whatever they want by spending enough Feelings. But that's not the big part. No, the big part is the cool powers that the players get for their characters.<br/><br/>Obviously, none of them are combat-oriented; they're all cool, weird stuff that acts as utility magic...but none of it has obvious uses. So to use your magic effectively, you need to figure out creative ways to apply it to your problems. Or you can just do cool stuff with it. And that, I think, is the lynchpin of GSS: you have to spend your time ferreting out the details of a situation, then figure out neat things to do with your magic.<br/><br/>If you have a little time to spare, I perpetually link people to my <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AndyHauge/posts/VJ25a52NTbQ" rel="nofollow">convention one-shot game</a>, which may be the absolute best roleplaying experience I've ever had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445048/#Comment_445048" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-01T02:43:40+00:00" title="May  1, 2015  2:43AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>While I can see this, what if you were -in- the scene?

I've played with a lot of introverts and I've seen variations of this technique work brilliantly at a social level. It allows people to come out with really exciting, innovative or deep stuff (sometimes all at once). The other game I've seen it used in to great effect is <i>Microscope</i>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445120/#Comment_445120" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-07T12:31:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2015 12:31PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Added a last bit of detail: unlike fanmail, Dreams don't directly impact the resolution mechanic.

If another participant agrees, they knock and you're done.  It's like a nonverbal "We cool?" "Yup" rather than "Stop it! We're done!" y'know?</blockquote>\nTotally. If it's the person who framed the scene who knocks first to say they're good I'd be more than comfortable with that way of doing things and would welcome it without any apprehension.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
