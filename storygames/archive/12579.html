It's turned out that we are the Lions of Tomorrow, the successors to a group of long-ago heroes, fated to finish off the evil they didn't quite vanquish. My thought was, what if you had a set-up where there <i>had</i> to be such a group, always, and the premise of a game (or part of it) is that there was a sudden need and the PCs got drafted. <br/><br/>So in your fantasy world you are the champions of destiny or the gods or whatever, viewed somewhere between a clandestine special forces unit and a superhero team by those in the know, only you're just reasonably ordinary fantasy-setting adventurer types. Part of the ongoing story is how you deal with that. You might be well-established heroes or you might be schmucks with basic useful skills. But when you come across a prophecy it's pretty much about you, and you can't wriggle out of it.<br/><br/>There are probably lots of interesting storygamey ways you could play with that. You could probably render it interestingly in a number of existing systems. <br/><br/>I've got the basics of a card-based generic system knocking about, so if I work it up I'll do a bit of setting outline and put it together with that to produce a little something. (I'm thinking maybe eventual publishing as something short, eg a cheap pdf and/or maybe in comicbook format... I'm sure I saw a POD comicbook outfit a while back, please remind me if you know.)<br/><br/>Some people may be dismayed that I'm going off on a tangent while Albion's hotting up, and I know, but on the other hand it's nice to have ideas arising to twiddle with for light relief.<br/><br/>I've got some metaphysics/cosmology bits bubbling up, cos that's me. My brain is shying away from geography though.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282529/#Comment_282529" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T17:17:09+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  5:17PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ka-Blam.<br/><br/><a href="http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/</a><br/><br/>Joe published Gun Thief through them and talks about it <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12376" rel="nofollow">here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282540/#Comment_282540" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T18:10:06+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  6:10PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Ka-Blam.<br/><br/><a href="http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/</a><br/><br/>Joe published Gun Thief through them and talks about it<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12376" rel="nofollow">here.</a></blockquote>\nI've got nothing but love for Ka-Blam. Their work on Gun Thief was tight, and including international shipping my order of 50 copies came to under 100 bucks. Solid.<br/><br/><br/>In other news, sounds like a cool concept. I'm hoping that a crux thing would be leveraging expectations. Like, you can use those expectations for rallying people and such and such, but you still risk failing on the battle field and damaging those expectations. Do you safeguard the good graces that you currently have, or gamble on people's hopes and hearts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282575/#Comment_282575" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T01:21:18+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  1:21AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

There's the name of who the characters are and there's the title, which might not be quite the same.<br/><br/>Some interesting setting ideas are creeping out of my brain. Like, sometime in the past a bunch of evil souls broke out of the domain of the goddess of death. Some of them escaped into the world of dreams, and now exist as nightmare creatures that manipulate your dreams so that eventually you mess up your waking life.<br/><br/>Something I seem to end up doing quite often is short setting outlines, with just enough information to give interesting hooks and atmosphere. It's quite fun when it works, but can also feel like a chore of going over similar ground and coming up with something different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282683/#Comment_282683" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T15:43:24+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  3:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Powell</cite>John Harper has talked about using<a href="http://www.magcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">MagCloud</a>to publish Lady Blackbird.

The Tigers of Eternity setting document is taking shape slowly. It's fun to play with. Some interesting bits and pieces have been worming their way out of my brain. It's fairly traditional in some ways and distinctive in others. Fiction vignettes for the start and end surfaced yesterday - fairly happy with those.<br/><br/>One thing that maybe someone here can help with. I don't have much picture at all of the geography - not beyond a few germs for specific places. I want to do a rapid-fire setting outline, a bit like Questers and Jaws, with just enough about the landscape and some places in it to get folks going. I could also use a map, preferably for very low cost. In fact, a map could become the basis of the setting.<br/><br/>I'm thinking sketching out part of a world, not a whole one. The Al-Qadim versions found themselves in desert and jungle, which worked well, but I'm thinking probably a more traditional temperate baseline here. Set at medium on the spectacular scale - some big/impressive things, but not too outrageous.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and it doesn't seem to have elves, dwarves, etc. Nor to need them, especially. And so far distinct human cultures haven't turned up either. I am thinking there might be reptile people, descendants of a race older than humanity whose civilisation fell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
