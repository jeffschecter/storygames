In each game the premise basically the same - you are the lone armored bounty hunter Samus Aran carrying out some mission, either for yourself or for the Galactic Federation.  Regardless of your goals, you have no backup and no support.<br/><br/>The planets you travel too are riddled with abandoned alien ruins to explore and natural hazards to overcome, not to mention dangerous native flora and fauna.  There is usually an implied story which emerges as you explore the ruins, fight aliens, and access old data stores.  The feeling I always get from the game is entering and old empty house where something <i>terrible</i> has happened, and piecing just what that something was together bit by bit before the house does something terrible to you.<br/><br/>Fortunately your armor is able to integrate some of the alien technology you find.  After defeating the tech's guardians you can add their strength to your own - better weapons, more sensors, stronger armor, strange abilities.<br/><br/><br/>I've often wondered if you could run something like Metroid in RPG format, but I've never found a system that I thought would work for it.  For one, most games have at least 3 or 4 PCs, while in Metroid there is just the lone hunter.  Also, defeating natural and artificial hazards in most games just turns into "succeed at your roll or die", which isn't interesting either.<br/><br/>Anyway, my copy of <a href="http://www.berengad.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=27" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters</a> came in the mail last week and got me thinking...lone hunter, overcoming challenges, absorbing the strengths of his foes.  It might just work...<br/><br/>Now all I have to do is: <br/>1) Get comfortable with the rules for Beast Hunters as written so I can hack them<br/>2) Find someone else who likes Metroid and knows the series to try it out with<br/><br/>Just a little idea - open to opinions if anyone's got one. Anyone else ever run a Metroid-themed game?  What system did you use? Did it work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63662/#Comment_63662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T09:57:16+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  9:57AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah, holy crap, that's an awesome idea.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I am not a big Metroid buff (even back when I was a crack-addled young'un, I found it very frustrating.

I'll have to educate myself about BH first, though.  I've got a "traditional gamer" friend who sounds interested in the challenge aspect of the game. Hopefully I can get him to play "vanilla" BH with me a few times so we can learn the system...then on to Metroid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63796/#Comment_63796" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T09:30:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  9:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jake, Travis, Matt and I are in the process of arranging at least three store demo days in May and June (so far for Nexus, Empire, and Rainy Day Games), so if you can come to any of those, you could definitely play Beast Hunters (and Panty Explosion, Classroom Deathmatch, Crossroads of Eternity...) then <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63798/#Comment_63798" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T09:47:12+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  9:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a great idea!

After looking at Beast Hunters, there's just one thing that doesn't fit.<br/><br/>The Beasts, and Tattoos (weapons that the final beasts give up) would work splendidly.  However, Metroid is mostly physical challenges, while Beast Hunters (while focusing on physical) also has mental and social.  Mental I can see with Metroid. I dunno, piloting a rocket, or trying to locate an item from a broken computer map. Fixing electrical wiring in a derelict spaceship.  But I can't see social actions in a Metroid-style game, even one that's not super-faithful to the material (I mean, who would Samus or folks like her talk to, or do by talking?).<br/><br/>I can't think of a suitable replacement for social, either.

There are a few instances in a couple games where someone talks to you, and you have some internal monologues in Metroid Fusion, but Samus never actually speaks to anyone in the games, much less has a social conflict.  <br/><br/>I still haven't played BH, so I don't have any good suggestions using the system.  Some thoughts anyway...<br/><br/>You could always fudge a bit and just play "Beast Hunters with a Metroid Flavor" - Have the occasional space colonist or exploratory team show up, as well as some non-hostile aliens and some rival hunters (a'la Metroid Prime: Hunters), to provide some social conflict. This is getting away from canon, but could still be fun, and you could totally use Beast Hunters for this.<br/><br/>Or like Chris says, simply leave out social conflicts and stick to the canon.  Then the question is "Can you have a fun one-on-one RPG with no social conflicts (and no dialogue for that matter)?<br/><br/>Or JDs suggestion of having the players all play the opposition to Samus, which would be a whole new game.<br/><br/>Some of this stuff almost demands new threads, but if people want to make this thread into a general discussion of Metroid as an RPG that's fine too.<br/><br/>Anyway, glad to hear people are thinking about this.  I'm still reading through the BH rules myself.  Hopefully Christian will be able to make it to Go Play NW so I can salute in.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Colin<br/><br/>(Edit: Crossposted w/ Christian)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
