We played college lovers named Tom and Margaret. Tom was uncertain if he had anything special going on for him, but was goth cute, and was witty, and wrote poetry. Margaret wanted to do something important with her life, and had anger issues, and was steamy hot.<br/><br/>And Jackson framed the very first scene of Long Road Nowhere around Margaret's trait "bleached blond hair", and narrated how Margaret was yelling at the maps in the passenger seat (!), and there was this moment when the sun caught her just right and her hair shone and she looked radiant. And then Tom totally moved over a seat in the back and said, "Mar mar, it's just a map. Settle down. Listen..." and he gave her a shoulder massage. And he used a really weak grip, and she said "you can even press a bit harder", so he adjusts his grip only the tiniest amount. That's most of the scene, then they pick up Pauline's kid brother.<br/><br/>The game kicks ass.<br/><br/>And then several games later, it's 2am and it's just me and Jackson and we're talking about this game he wrote called Hydra. It's inspired by a conversation he had with Brendan Adkins (sp?), who is "the boss" wrapped in "the bomb" covered in "the shit". The game has 10 constrained scenes, and each scene is either before, after or a mirror of one of the previous scenes. In each scene, the dialogue and description follows a tight pattern of:<br/><br/>Player A - Dialogue, Description (set the scene)<br/>[<i>OPTIONAL<br/>Player B - Description<br/>Player A - Description</i>]<br/>Player B - Dialogue, Description<br/>[<i>OPTIONAL<br/>Player A - Description<br/>Player B - Description</i>]<br/>Player A - Dialogue, Description<br/>[<i>OPTIONAL<br/>Player B - Description<br/>Player A - Description</i>]<br/>Player B - Dialogue<br/><br/>So, you have exactly four lines of dialogue in every scene. Lines of description fill the spaces between these points of dialogue. It's very tight, word-wise.<br/><br/>We played The Hydra as Tom and Margaret. Scene one was at a circus and Margaret was having fun and Tom felt bored and jaded.<br/>Scene two was at a circus at a spaceport, and Margaret was having space-fun and Tom felt bored and claustrophobic.<br/>Scene three was at a camp site, and it turned out they had doubled up with another couple in a tent. Hot.<br/>Scene four was the scene I described from Long Road Nowhere.<br/><br/>I opened the scene by saying <i>"Mar mar, it's just a map. Settle down. Listen..." and then Tom gives her a shoulder massage with a really weak grip.</i> And me and Jackson were both suddenly really excited. Reframing that scene in this game, with it's tight verbal pattern, was a really cool play experience. We got to play with what the character's saw and didn't see the first time around. I narrate them passing by a hitchhiker in a white sweater there, whereas in Long Road Nowhere they picked that guy up at a place two towns over afterwards (they would have still in this version, I assume, but it was a nice "at this point, to you guys, this guy doesn't really exist yet" moment).<br/><br/>The best part was that we knew what happened next. And we know how the road trip ends. But we didn't know what happened next. And now... now we get to know what happens next.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165855/#Comment_165855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T22:01:47+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 10:01PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am now all that with "the boner."<br/><br/>Jackson!

Since that whole game's about jumping around though time, the instances of "reveal" are usually sort of behind-the-hand, insinuative - not experienced by the characters, but by the players. <br/>in LRN, the instances of realization are usually experienced by the players and the characters at the same time.<br/><br/>during LRN, one of Tom's big focuses was "whether he should leave Margaret and find someone simpler". in that game, we learned that he decided to stay with it, keep on with the relationship. so it was fun to comment on that through our play of The Hydra, if we'd played it longer i'm sure we'd have gotten into alternate realities of them being together or not together. <br/><br/>it was very interesting to have the same materials (margaret and tom), but be interacting with them very differently with the different rule sets. so interesting that i made a game so that i could play another character again- my fifteen year old fashion skate kid from "Best Friends", Ranger! She is like, SO ready to be a detective now. Obviously, i'm gonna make a game about that. Like, Done. <br/><br/>whoa, tangent. point: as Brendan foretold, playing a scene over is awesome. the spaceport version of the fair was less so, in comparason, because i didn't feel like we could really get it wrong, because it was also a genre variation (which, as i describe being less than satisfied with it, it should be noted that i described this option in the introduction of the game)<br/>playing a scene over (especially as the first scene played of the day, then two games, then a fourth game and that same scene being the last of the scenes of the day... pretty special.) across systems was lovely, having different permissions and guidelines, and knowing where to go- and wanting to quote yourself exactly- making it perfect.<br/><br/>it was just very special, that's a good word for it.<br/><br/>oh! i didn't get the insinuation that M&amp;T were camping with other folks. for me, they were just messing around up in the woods, chopping wood and kind of bickering. when did the other folks come in?<br/><br/>what i like about The Hydra that i didn't foresee liking so much: that it was so easy to not say anything at all with the dialogue, to say everything with the description. it's the biggest show-don't-tell thing i've ever participated in. and starting scenes in the middle is very necessary, so it's a good tool to train that. i'll play more and post about it when i feel good and god damned ready, thank you.  *tongue out*<br/><br/><br/>and i'm glad about the boner, brendan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
