                    One of the primary reasons I roleplay is to learn about myself and the people I play with.  I like to explore what decisions we make, push buttons (obviously with limits, usually as defined by the social contract), and expose ourselves to issues and challenges.  <br/><br/>In a recent blog entry I talk about <a href="http://eruditus.livejournal.com/32171.html" rel="nofollow">character types and what they say about me</a>.  It was quite inconclusive however it was a very armchair discussion without a whole lot of thought to what the character types mean or how they are defined.  Certainly all of our characters are just copies of ourselves to one degree or another.  Some gamers take more of themselves than others.  Some of us are method actors when we game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So I open up to you bright folk <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What types of characters do we play?  What sorts of categories might we use to conveniently file them.  These categories should travel across systems and convey a bit of information while remaining broad enough to be useful.  Now, of course every measurement of this type is most useful if it's geared toward "what are you looking for?"  I realize this but I am trying to find a more general measurement and see what happens.  <br/><br/><b>Disclaimer:</b> I realize that various fields and internet quizzes might accomplish all that I need.  "Yeah, Don, all you need to do is run each of your PCs through the Meyers-Briggs exam or do the 'what Order-of-the-Stick character are you' quiz."  Obviously I want to discuss this and come to some sort of concensus of "sure, this works for me."  Not that some of those tools won't assist us in doing it however I do prefer to explore our own way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>So I think that the first step in this process is figuring out what the basis to our character types will be.  I think I have been going toward character directives - how a PC approaches situations and how the character is designed to best approach those situations.  Maybe we could use two or three ideas so that each character gets three words that make up their category - one for character directives, one for familiarity (as an example) and one for deviance (how far from reality is their world?).  So any suggestions where to start?                </div>

                            Recently I've been playing the strong, upright fighter-types. High morality, willing to fight (with a stick, typically) for what they believe in. I've played con-artist wizards, naiive clerics, fast-talking traders, reclusive nancy-boy psions, enthusiastic monks... all over the place. I have a huge desire to, at some point, play the evil necromancer who's only with the party because they're killing off his rivals.<br/><br/>I can think up words for character directives and for game-world deviance, but not for familiarity. I'm not sure what that would even mean - is that how close the character is to my own personality?                        </div>

                            I had forgotten about that.  I recall Brennan linking this in a discussion once.  That's cool too.  It's tough for us method actors to glean as much info.  I think I tend to play characters very different than me yet I believe there is something to learn form their similarities. It's just not as transparent as some.                        </div>

                            Lately I've been playing a lot of "face" characters - men with lots of social interaction mojo. Before the current set of games, I was playing an out-and-out bad guy. There was some serious tension in the group over (wanting to avoid the) possibility of PvP situations, so I ended up making a deal where my nasty fellow agreed to do all the dirty work for one of the other PCs in exchange for her turning a blind eye to his empire-building and nastiness. Once we found a functional way for me to be bad, I had a lot of fun playing him. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.                        </div>

                            I actually had a conversation about this recently.  Back in the old days playing lots of World of Darkness, I played a lot of cynical socialites who were all full of stymied idealism.  They wanted to change the world, but they'd been blocked and stopped and <em>started play</em> already bitter about things.  I think this reflects a little about the kind of play I was expecting in those World of Darkness games.<br/><br/>More recently, I've played a lot of innocents, a lot of children, and a lot of bumblers.  I think this is also due to the games I've been playing, since indie games allow me to play these sub-optimal power ranges yet still participate in the game, and innocence and idealism aren't automatically fated to be smashed to bits.                        </div>

                            I think attempting to come up with character types will mostly result in a rehashing of player motivations, and something like an extended version of CA. A lot of character types are probably some variation on the basic 'what would it be like to be X' wish fulfillment, while others are created primarily to fill roles in a particular type of story or to address a particular premise. I'm not sure how productive it would be to come up with character types that operate independantly of player motivations -- what could that tell us? -- but it could be an opportunity to come up with categories of player motivation that have more to do with specific aspects of the SIS than the larger-scale CA cycle.                        </div>

                            Warriors and philosophers.<br/>
<br/>
Often, I play the philosophical warriors. Some times, I'll play a savage or ruthless warrior and study his personality from another angle. Other times, I'll play a diplomatic type, who tries to talk things out and avoid combat as much as possible. Unfortunately, most games being what they are, the latter concept is less supported.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the most interesting themes to explore are trust, love, and violence (or a lack of any of the three). My characters reflect this regardless of concept. I play passionate (inside, if not without), often driven characters who tend to focus either on themselves (they protect those they love because it's in their best interest) or their ideals (they become distanced paragons of their lofty goals in order to protect what they value).<br/>
<br/>
I've had an acute interest in the martial arts, mythology and philosophy all my life, so playing this way comes naturally to me. In gaming, I love having the chance to play a character who makes difficult (and potentially wrong or terrible) descisions in order to make his way down the path he has chosen for himself. Part of that, of course, is inevitably suffering the ultimate consequences of those descisions (or, on occasion, reaping the rewards; though the warrior tends to live and die by the sword).<br/>
<br/>
It ends up looking something like a chanbara or western flick, nine times out of ten. ;)                        </div>

                            RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE<br/><br/>After discussing things with my wife (especially) and the other players in the group, I can safely amend my "I play liars" above. After all, I played a gleefully truth-loving Galactic Senator in a Star Wars game who used facts like skewers and Sith Lords like kebab ingredients and is the only man known who ever murdered a Dark Jedi with a tariff. He disliked lies and viewed them as one might view the bottom of one's shoe after stepping in some small pet's excrement. Sadly and with distaste.<br/><br/>My character is the guy who when he walks into the room, everyone in the room thinks "Oh boy. Here we go."  The bad guys don't consider him a problem - the good guys don't consider him much of an asset - but everyone, everyone, considers him to be Trouble.  His appearance means the pot will soon be stirred and everyone's plans will be thrown into havoc.  No one will ever be the archnemesis of a Corley character (except another Corley character), because there's just no point, he's not that difficult to defeat - he's just incredibly hard to anticipate.<br/><br/>Interestingly, my wife's characters, who she summarizes as "crazy, or violent", all end up hating my characters' guts, or thinking <i>he's</i> crazy.                        </div>

                            I think my most memorable and fun role play experiences have been in Cthulhu and Dr Who games playing young girls. The 25th Century Valley Girl was like totally fun because Calculus is sooo fifth grade. And running the 12 year old psych ward girl who reassured herself that it had to be okay to remember what had happened was equally fun. These characters required massive role playing rather than crunchy min maxing.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what character I pick I seems to end up playing them as problem solvers.<br/>

It's not the same without the visual:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2006-December/gifswLzSnIm0O.gif"/><br/><br/>When it comes to thematic games, I tend to play Nice Guys. Sometimes they are Nice Guys that go all Jack Bauer when pushed:<br/>GM : "You fail to convince him of your argument"<br/>Me: "I get my pliers out"<br/><br/>But honestly, it tends to be random: Men, women, white, black, asian, good, bad, wholesome, spiteful, etc. When the game has potential to be ongoing, I tend to be a nice guy, the glue that tends to bring the party together.  When the game is a 1-2 shot, I'll do whatever.<br/><br/>When I sit down and just come up with an adventure game character, though, I LOVE to make ninja types. Prince of Persia style thieves that are 50% parkour, 20% fighting and 30% hiding in shadows. Thieves or fighter types. I rarely choose magic users/psis/clerics.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            My characters all tend to embody one or both of the following two themes:<br/><br/>1) They're really good at something, but not the thing they want to be really good at. (The great warrior who dreams of being a poet.)<br/><br/>2) They think they're motivated by one thing when they're actually motivated by something else entirely. (The wizard who seeks magical power as a substitute for the love and acceptance he won't admit he needs and subconsciously doesn't think he deserves anyway.)<br/><br/>Sadly, they also tend to be characterized by my utter failure to effectively portray that aspect of their personality in the game, but that's neither here nor there. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

Yep, very much the direction I'm currently going. Roleplaying is an outlet for all the risk-taking, socially unacceptable, destructive and wild parts of my personality that I'm very careful not to let out IRL. <br/><br/>My current character in Vaxalon's Amber game at one point suggested not just killing Corwin and taking his stuff, but <i>cutting him up and using the pieces to create a zombie Corwin army</i>. Out of character, of course, I knew the other players wouldn't let me, so it was - safe to be that dangerous.<br/><br/>My father used to do the same thing, I think, except he played villains in light opera instead of roleplaying.                        </div>

                            Wow.  Might I offer a Challenge <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> to participants in this thread?<br/><br/>I'd love to see people look at the top, see a cool idea, and perhaps aim to play that kind of character at some point in the future.<br/><br/>Basically, I was knocked back by this:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>They're really good at something, but not the thing they want to be really good at. (The great warrior who dreams of being a poet.)</blockquote>
and I thought, "Damn, why didn't I think of that before?" Sure, I may not be able to get any more out of it than Ron did, but still it's a cool concept.  I'm going to give it a shot sometime.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I tend towards two different character types.  First, since I GM so much for the various groups that I'm involved in, when I get on the other side of the screen I like to play the hero.  Driven and dedicated to a cause, confined in action by a strong sense of personal morality, all of that good stuff.  In the last two games that I was a player in, the three characters I played were a road warden, a sheriff, and a town's guardsman.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I also like to play characters that are deeply and terribly broken.  People who question their role in life, people who hate themselves or what they've done.  The town guardsman character from above was bitten on the right arm by a zombie pre-game and that part of her body had turned terrible and zombified, the rest being spared only because of a makeshift tourniquet that she had quickly tied her arm off with.  She hated herself and her lot in life and, as things got worse for her and she felt herself get further divided from her humanity she became cold and murderous.  She crushed a man's skull with her zombie arm, she lit creatures on fire.  It all came to a head when she purposefully hunted down a man through the woods and remorselessly murdered him.  <br/><br/>In truth, a lot of the stuff with that character came out because of some truly terrible stuff that I was going through, and still am, in my personal life.  Even still, the part that I have the most fun with as a player is getting messed with.  I love making characters with built in trouble.  I'm playing in a fantasy campaign right now where my road warden character is a drunkard and gambler and owes tons of money to the local mob boss.  I got absolutely no system-based reward for setting these things up for my character.  What I do get is some personal trouble, tailor-made for me, that I think is fun that also adds something to the GMs toolbox to help spice things up whenever he wants.                        </div>
