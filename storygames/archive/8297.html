It's focused, or does this great new thing, or is just intensely fun - and it's made by their friend.<br/><br/>The game probably is great, too! And in the current deluge of great role-playing game designs, no wonder that nobody's heard of it. Still, though, as a recommendation, it's only one step up from "My game is great!" To me, it says "in this tiny bubble of gaming culture that is our personal circle of gamers, between 2 and 10 people are enjoying this game." If I'm not part of that bubble, the recommendation doesn't help me all that much.<br/><br/>Not saying people should stop recommending their friends' games. I'm going to continue doing it, as long as those games have merit (you can check out my past posts on Story Games to see what I write about Itras By, Until we Sink and Muu, for example). But just wanted to post this as a general observation.<br/><br/>Any opinions? Do you care who recommends a game? Does it matter whether they're a friend of the designer or not?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183149/#Comment_183149" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T04:28:28+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to discount recommendations, just a little, if I know they're coming from a friend of the author.<br/><br/>There is a <i>certain group of people</i> who tend to recommend each other's games, all the time.

You certainly see circular back-patting and pimping from groups like the Collective Endeavour and the Play Collective, pseudo-business entities with some quantitative interest in mutual success.  Of course they are also all friends, and they are also generating quality games, too.  Nobody is trying to fool anybody.<br/><br/>I do this too, and I'm far more likely to take notice of, play, and praise a game written by someone I know, trust, and like.  Who isn't?  And people you like probably like you too, and the mutual admiration society is born.  I'm keenly aware of this and understand to some degree my reputation rests on my practice of not saying things I don't mean.  If I say "Anna Kreider's Polaris hack Thou Art But A Warrior is fantastic", I mean it - even though Anna and I are also best pals and she's said the same thing about my games.<br/><br/>So, shrug.  If you're worried that marketing is getting mixed in with honest enthusiasm, don't buy games you haven't played and the problem is solved.  If you can't do that, ignore the advice of people you don't know, trust, and like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183160/#Comment_183160" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T08:04:51+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  8:04AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Any opinions?

We weren't friends when I first bought, played and enjoyed his game but over the course of gaming together at cons, e-mail and IM correspendence and so on, we have become buddies.

You will need to take that into account.

I'm a very enthusiastic person. And online, it's probably amplified due to communication restraints. And probably grows more confused because if people have already said what I wanted to say of value, I'll often just pipe in with contentless enthusiasm as to not repeat those points. I'm going to try stop doing that. But those who have had conversations with me in person know that my enthusiasm isn't a blind one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don't go on and on about all my friend's games and all the games I've playtested. Both which are large numbers. But I do go on and on about the games I actually play. I figure in a crowded market with limited play time, investing in a game by playing it is probably a good indication that the game has something to it and is worth sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, even though Matt who wrote PTA is a very good friend of mine and I've played 50+ sessions of Dogs in the Vineyard, I do die a little bit inside (I'm also prone to exaggeration for drama's sake which probably doesn't help) when people recommend these games in place of games that are completely unrelated. I'm not a fan of this game can do everything because it is my favorite game!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'm going to do moving forward is make sure I'm clear about my relationship to the game. Being friends with the creator, having playtested, and any business relationships (for money or volunteer which is none at the moment except for the playstorming crew). I figure more information is better than less. And I'd rather be accurate and trusted than ever win someone over by misleading them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I want people who love their friends game to tell us about them as long as we know they are friends (just saying they are friends is enough in most cases) and they tell us why they love them. Beyond that, it's always up the audience to decide how useful this information is to them and they can always ask questions for more information before making judgments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If someone constantly acquits themselves well in public forum, writing well-written and thought-out posts, not being an asshole when things get a little high-tension, then eventually I'll form the opinion that they're a pretty squared away person.

If a casual acquaintance tells me something's awesome, I listen charitably but don't necessarily think I'm going to end up agreeing with them.  If it's just someone I know from the internet saying something is awesome, pfft, whatever; they have to win me over with reasons and evidence, because I tend to just ignore their enthusiasm outright.  Maybe on some level I just figure that what they think is cool is likely to be nothing like anything I think is cool...I know it's got nothing to do with their reliability or objectivity as individuals, because in general, I'm sure that people on the internet are just as reliable and objective as anyone I know in real life.  No, it's purely a matter of me only giving weight to opinions that come from sources I know very well and who in return know me very well.<br/><br/>So I don't mind if someone wants to tell me that their friend's game is great.

The recommendations that I care about are made by people that I consider to be intelligent and honest. If they say a game is good, it's good. I trust them. That's why I'm listening to them in the first place. This is why I bought Inspectres and Lacuna, because Luke Crane said they were awesome. He's friends with the designer, but fuck that, I trust him. This is also why I bought Last Night on Earth, because Paul Tevis said it was awesome. He's not friends with the designer, though, but fuck that too.

Some games written by friends. I actually used to have the reputation that I was too harsh! And from 2004-2006 I used to have people attack me for my negative opinions even when based on multiple actual plays. It's crazy how perception works :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe finished games I rave about are Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Dogs in the Vineyard, Burning Wheel variants, Grey Ranks, and Dread. Many of these games I don't even recommend when people say, which system can I use for X idea as I generally feel these games do very specific things very well. And there are non-finished games that I rave about from the context of they aren't finished so I don't know what the end result will be but I had a blast with what I've seen so far and am very excited for the end product including A Taste For Murder, Contract Work, 1st Quest, Land of Nodd, Wegs, Trial and Terror, and Misspent Youth. Finally I may rave about a mechanic or idea in a game isolated from the rest of the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to say I love a session of play but that could be due to many reasons. The players, the GM, the game, the setting, and so on. I try to be specific when asked.

If you don't know someone, you have no business accepting recommendations from them without questioning them.  Their personal relationships are certainly part of that knowledge, just like their personal taste in games and their knowledge of your own taste.<br><br>Specifically though, if I know somebody knows the designer, that tells me a couple things.  Knowing the designer (depending on how closely they know one another) means that this person is likely to have a pretty good knowledge of the game itself, so they're qualified to talk about it.  If the context is appropriate, odds are that, unless the person is a complete tool (you probably already know if they are), you can trust them to give you some good information about the game in question.  If you feel it's necessary, take it with a grain of salt.  Ask questions.  Probe.

For instance, I have two motives when I recommend Fastlane. First, I do think it is a great game, and I think people would enjoy it if they played it. On the other hand, if Alex weren't my friend, my opinion would be more "Well, I've got my copy. Why should I care if anyone else plays it, as it doesn't affect me?" I'm like that with most other games. Dogs in the Vineyard, for example. I've met Vincent, but I wouldn't say I know him or that we are friends. As such, if he never sells another copy of DitV, it wouldn't bother me much one way or the other (at least until my copy wears out, and I want to replace it). Because Alex is my friend, I care that Fastlane doesn't get the attention it deserves from people I'll never play with. Which isn't to say that I recommend it uncritically, or that I'll recommend it when it doesn't seem appropriate. It just means that whenever there's an opportunity to mention it in an appropriate context, I'm going to. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make my recommendation suspect? I don't think it does. I'd like to think I'm honest enough with myself and with everyone else that my recommendation is legitimate, completely aside from my secondary motivation.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183427/#Comment_183427" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T09:44:18+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  9:44AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think about it at times, but in the end I don't worry about it too much.<br/><br/>Frex, I would never have tried Dread: The First Book of Panedmonium if it weren't for the fact that Rafael became a friend of mine: I wasn't interested in the subject matter, honestly.  Turns out that I *always was deeply interested in the subject matter*, I just didn't realize it at the time. I tend not to recommend this game to everyone, because its high-horror high-"kewlness"-action appeals to some more than others (so I tend to be guarded when recommending it), but at this point I don't really consider my friendship to Raf when I plug it.<br/><br/>However, in the more recent case of HELLAS, I feel a little at odds for this reason: I was kinda interested in the game, only on my radar because a friend was working on it. Then, when I finally had the thing in my hands (in PDF first), my lid was indeed flipped. I even go as far as to profess that it is the best game that came out in 2008 (although I forgot that IAWA came out this year too, which also is a favorite). Problem is, after the lid-flipping, I went to GenCon and shared a booth with the Hellas guys. I became closer with that team as friends. So now, when I recommend Hellas (and the people I aim at are into the high-action fantasy/culture mashups), I try to give more details about WHY I like the game, otherwise it just sounds like "friend shilling", when in truth I mean to point out the game on its own merits. It's shit hot, but I kinda worry about my ties to the game make me too close to promote it. Still, it's not like I'm writing material for the game or anything.

So if folks have a relationship with the game's author may be a factor in determining my overall impression of the way that I read their recommendation/review, but on its own its just another, usually minor, variable in the complex process by which I decide which of you are interesting and which of you are wastes of skin. Degree of reflection, understanding and addressing of various issues specific to the context of the discussion, and the ability to actually listen and respond to people's questions are all things that are likely to weigh far heavier on if I find a particular recommendation relevant than on whether or not the recommender may once have slept with the game developer in one of those "What happens at GenCon stays at GenCon" moments. <br/><br/>Also on the clique lines thing, some important facts: Vincent is part of my clique because I love his manly bread making skills, but Vincent is not part of my clique because he thinks I smell of yeast. Similarly, Jason Morningstar ate mushrooms at my house once, but he also finds historical discussions online with me to be difficult, and thus has ruthlessly excluded me from his clique by telling Clinton that I smell of cheese. Joanthan and I used to be part of the same clique, but our sexual jealousy of Shreyas drove us apart. <br/><br/>Use these facts when making your relationship map, and you shall go far.

author. For example, I know a few active posters with a love for very heavy, precise game mechanics - a praise from them is a sure mark for me that I'd never love that game. A second factor is that many, many of us here either playtest our games with friends who can offer good critique, or are those friends, so I often do trust the recommendations of a friend of the author who's been in on the playtesting - as long as I know we share a similar way of enjoying games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I trust very much is praise from a person who knows the author and does not like him/her, but nevertheless recommends a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183592/#Comment_183592" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T22:00:45+00:00" title="December 15, 2008 10:00PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>However, in the more recent case of HELLAS, I feel a little at odds for this reason: I was kinda interested in the game, only on my radar because a friend was working on it. Then, when I finally had the thing in my hands (in PDF first), my lid was indeed flipped. I even go as far as to profess that it is the best game that came out in 2008 (although I forgot that IAWA came out this year too, which also is a favorite). Problem is, after the lid-flipping, I went to GenCon and shared a booth with the Hellas guys. I became closer with that team as friends. So now, when I recommend Hellas (and the people I aim at are into the high-action fantasy/culture mashups), I try to give more details about WHY I like the game, otherwise it just sounds like "friend shilling", when in truth I mean to point out the game on its own merits. It's shit hot, but I kinda worry about my ties to the game make me too close to promote it. Still, it's not like I'm writing material for the game or anything. Yet.</blockquote>\nFor the record, I purchased this game on your recommendation, after you ran down all the things about it that popped.

It depends on context. It depends on who is making the recommendation and what I know of them. It is good when the friendship (or other relationship) is acknowledged. <br/><br/>What is really important is an explanation of why one recommends a game: in what way does it answer the discussed needs or interests?<br/><br/>A link to more information, if not to the game (if free), is crucial.<br/><br/>These soothe my fear of bias in a designer\u2019s friend recommendation.<br/><br/>My final fear is that the recommended game is too \u201clocal\u201d. Either the gaming pleasure is a local taste or, and this is the worst, the system is not complete in the game: an (important?) part of it is in the local community culture (for a given value of local). And for that I know of no cure <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183612/#Comment_183612" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T04:23:39+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  4:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Jason Morningstar ate mushrooms at my house once, but he also finds historical discussions online with me to be difficult, and thus has ruthlessly excluded me from his clique by telling Clinton that I smell of cheese.</blockquote>\nLet the pain make you stronger.
