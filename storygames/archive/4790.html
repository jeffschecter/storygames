The other Root Trolls weren't sure that they wanted the burden of a fragile human girl-child, but Nyesh and Lur took me in without any hesitation. They taught me to hunt and forage, to track and sneak.<br/><br/><b>Why did I join the temple?</b><br/>Banbur Forest was under attack by the forces of Idgara, Graf of Gall. Because the Root Trolls knew nothing of writing, they had no way of contacting the temple--until I volunteered to be the message. It was hard to leave Nyesh and Lur, but I knew that the others weren't all that sad to see me go.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>One of the monks asked me to shoot down a bird perched atop the temple gate. I asked him if it was for supper; he said it wasn't. So I refused to kill for his amusement. He wasn't angry, though: he smiled and welcomed me inside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kobayashi<br/><b>Jing Lao</b><br/><br/><b>Whom do I miss most from home?</b><br/>I miss my sister, she serves as a nurse aboard a flying fortress. I don't know if I will see her again. My brother has already been killed by the Oceanians (or was it the Eurasians, I can't remember...). When I was younger, I testified against my parents, saying they were traitors to Brother Emperor, the ruler of Eastasia. I never saw them again after their trial. I can't even remember their face.<br/><br/><b>Why did I join the temple?</b><br/>When I deserted the Youth Brigade I was chased by the Truth Police. I ran through the ruins of Middle City 1 and ended up in front of an old temple.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I had to tell the monks what crime my parents had commited. I said my parents were innocent and wept. One monk took me in his arms and led me into the temple...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Paulie<br/><b>Vanya Irskov</b><br/><br/><b>Whom do I miss most from home?</b><br/>I miss most , my babushka , she looked after us when father died, mother was so busy and so her mother came to look after us in such tough times.<br/><br/><b>Why did I join the temple?</b><br/>I joined to see the worlds.<br/><br/>Babushka looked after us as best she could , she would tell us stories of the far away places. The excitement the adventure, the temple.<br/>the temple interested me the most.<br/>I just wanted to see it. It was the most beautiful thing she ever described to us.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I would have thought from the description of the temple and its monks that babushka told us of, that it would be a test of bravery. The monks so brave, but my test came one night a new girl came to petition the temple not yet 8 years old and that dark night missed her home so much. So I did what babushka always did when I missed father, I told her a story of the wonderful places whe would go, the wonderful people she would meet.<br/><br/>I think It was that kindess that the master saw and allowed me to enter the temple.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan Walton<br/><b>We are the Fourth and Fifth Brides of Dizang Bawang, the Infernal King; we were known in life as the Sacrificial Twins, Rasha and Lukka.</b><br/><br/><b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><br/>We miss the feeling of grass between our toes, the taste of chocolate, the smell of rain. Mostly we miss our lord, Dizang Bawang, who was always kind to us.<br/><br/><b>Why I joined the temple?</b><br/>When our lord, Dizang Bawang, came of age to fulfill his birthright and take up his position as the king of hell, he stepped into the fire that would render him into smoke and ash, transporting him to the realm of fire. We followed him, just a few steps behind his first three brides, but, instead of traveling with our lord to take up rulership over demons and ghosts, our smoke spirits intermingled and slowly drifted to the center of the sky. One of us cried tears of fire and admitted that she had put a letter in her pocket, asking the Temple to save us, for she did not wish to be a queen of the netherworld. The other cried as well, for now we were one, two smoke spirits locked together in a tearful embrace, trapped in the realm of earth and stone where we did not belong.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>The prayer wheels that hang from the Temple's gates spin forever in the sky-wind, wishing blessings on the world but also providing a barrier to ward off evil spirits. At first we were afraid that they would tear us apart, forever separating us sisters -- who had never been apart for even one minute of our lives -- but they did not. Instead, we drifted over them into a courtyard where a monk was burning incense, drawing us into the sweet fumes. He had put out a plate of steamed rice on a low wooden table and we ate hungrily in gratitude before collapsing to the ground in sleep.<br/><br/>I'll explain step 2 in the next post...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107705/#Comment_107705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T12:49:21+00:00" title="November 10, 2007 12:49PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After your private interview is completed, you're brought before Master Low Branch along with a few other would-be pilgrims. Here, you will be asked to declare your new pilgrim name. You will also discover how you are remembered by your fellow companions.<br/><br/>First, each of you must declare your new pilgrim name, comprised of two words. The first is usually an action or description, the second usually a place or thing in or around the temple. Pilgrim names can be austere and regal, humorous and lively or plain old perplexing. Your name is unique to your personality and feelings towards your time in the temple.<br/><br/>Examples: Eminent Spire, Celestial Chest, Whimsical Abbey, Lone Beam, Formal Organ, Intimate Bamboo, Forceful Abbey, Diligent Kata, Last Tower, Striking Chime, August Leaf, Deferential Plug, Sharp Courtyard, Elder Bucket.<br/><br/>If you need some inspiration, feel free to play around with the <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Pilgrim_Names" rel="nofollow">pilgrim name generator</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Tinat, Jing Lao, Vanya Irskov, Rasha and Lukka...

It was a beautiful, dangerous thing, like a brightly colored tropical fish with ten-thousand poisonous spines.  Tinat was showing us how to make it dive and ripple, like a living thing in the air.  A particularly spectacular maneuver startled a tree full of sparrows, scattering them to the heavens, ignorant of the dangers of sharing the sky with Tinat's battle kite.  Not wanting the injure the birds, Tinat struggled to reel in her line. When the kite's spiny tail was within reach, Tinat grabbed it unhesitatingly and yanked the kite to the ground.  Though her hand left a red trail through the frost, Tinat refused to the abbott attend to her before he had mended the wing of one unlucky sparrow chick.<br><br><b>Power</b> - Outspoken Gift<br><br>The previous winter, Jing Lao and the Brides stood within the archway of the temple's great door, watching for the first signs of snow.  Jing Lao spotted it first, a single perfect snowflake dancing slowly some 100 yards away from us, down the frosted steps that led up to the temple.  "It is a tragedy," we said, "that the snowflake will simply melt, chilling the earth ever so slightly in preparation for its ten-thousand siblings, in the hopes that some will survive, even for a few hours."  Before we had finished speaking, Jing Lao had closed to without a few yards of the snowflake, moving effortlessly but with incredible speed, skipping across the treacherous stones.  Mouth agape, he caught the snowflake on the tip of his tongue, but, between the three of us, we could not decide if this was a nobler fate.<br/><br/><b>Wisdom</b> - Precise Book<br/><br/>The previous fall, Vanya was telling stories around the central fireplace when a great wind descended down the chimney and extinguished the fire.  Eager for the stories to continue, the Brides, along with the rest of Vanya's audience, helped relight the fire.  However, Vanya had barely finished his next sentence when the winds came again and the fire was dead once more.  The Brides reached for the tenderbox, but Vanya said, "The chimney spirit is trying to sleep and is angry at being awakened, even by our fanciful tales.  Let us try again tomorrow."  He left a ginger root standing in a bowl of milk on the hearth and, from then on, we always made an effort to be polite to the chimney spirit.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108429/#Comment_108429" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T14:00:34+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  2:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2007 2:05PM by DanielSolis.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>P.S. are the three traits mean to be the same as the three parts of the Triforce in<i>Zelda</i>? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nYup!

If you've been keeping track of the Tiger Group's thread, you may already have thought about what you'll do in this step. I've made a few tweaks and edits to the list of options, so you probably want to review the list again. If this is your first exposure to this step of character creation, let's start from the top:\n<blockquote>...Now that you've heard your companions' memories of you, the temple elders ask you to meditate on your relationship to each of your companions...</blockquote>\nIn this final step of character creation, you will choose the type of relationship you have to each of your companions. These relationships are called "Bonds."<br/><br/>You should have some sense of what Bonds do in play before choosing one, even if we're not going into an actual session. They're kind of like a <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/tsoy/book1--rulebook.html#keys" rel="nofollow">Key</a> from Shadow of Yesterday, mixed with the <a href="http://futureimperfect.wikidot.com/future-imperfect-character-creation" rel="nofollow">Thematic Batteries</a> from Full Light, Full Steam. A Bond has certain conditions that allow you to store up resources to make your character more effective in the future. The twist is that the only way to actually spend those resources is to change the Bond to something else.\n<blockquote>For example, in Futurama, Fry has been cultivating a Bond of the Crush to Leela for a few sessions. While on a delivery, Leela gets surrounded by some angry mutants. Fry is desperate to help, but there are too many for him to have any hope of defeating on his own. He's got to use the dice he's saved up, but in order do so, the relationship has to change. Fry's player decides to change the relationship to Bond of Fraternity. He accepts that they won't be lovers, but they will still be the best of friends.</blockquote>\nWithout getting too deep into the mechanical details, that's how bonds are used in play.<br/><br/><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dct676c8_60g4hzch" rel="nofollow"><b>Click here</b></a> for an updated, but still brief and incomplete list of titles and descriptions for a number of Bonds. If you can think of another type of Bond that would be more appropriate for your character, go ahead and write that one down but please give me a description so that I can assess whether it should be added to the general list.<br/><br/><b>Choose one bond for each of your companions.</b> You cannot have the same type of bond to two or more companions. This Bond is your relationship to that character, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their relationship to you. For example, you might have a Bond of Adoption with your companion. You consider them like a sister to you. But that companion might not feel the same way.

Of course, we can never be together, for he is of the living and we are two mingled ghosts.  Besides, he would surely cause jealousy between us, something which we could not bear.  This bond is fostered by the memory of our lost love.<br/><br/><b>Bond of the Caretaker with Outspoken Gift:</b>  Our companion's dead parents are calling to him, grasping at him with their ghostly fingers and seeking to pull him towards the underworld.  We must prevent them from succeeding.  This bond is fostered by us being the only ones who can see this happening.<br/><br/><b>Bond of the Tempter with Precise Book:</b> Our companion needs to spend less time with his stories and more time experiencing the fullness of life.  This bond is fostered by our memory of the flesh and our wistfulness for sensation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109551/#Comment_109551" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T09:23:03+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  9:23AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.
