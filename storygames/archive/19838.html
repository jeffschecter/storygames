The art style is inspired by Toulouse Lautrec poster art with a dash of Van Gogh. Both 1890's artists which fit the time of Sherlock Holmes. The game uses action cards, each card uses a unique picture so I'll be making a lot of pieces.<br/><br/>All the players are Sherlock Holmes so the players collude to make him look brilliant. They also each champion another character, one of whom is guilty of murder. Games take an hour to play. Players describe what happens in scenes, which add clue upon clue till the guilty party is revealed. <br/><br/>Players have a hand of five action cards. They play a card and let that inspire the story they make up. Stories are about what all the characters do so you are the writer more than an actor. Other players can play a card to add to the story, you can give a card to a player to modify their tale or use a card to challenge (roll dice) to totally re-write their tale. Separate scene cards guide play through a coherent story. In the end Holmes says who did it. <br/><br/>So think of this game as a card moderated conversation between the players. Everyone has equal power to start a turn, add, modify or re-write. Unlike say, Fiasco, scenes are not acted out between players but are written whole cloth by a single player/author. It produces a story that feels like the SH canon. <br/><br/>My creative agenda has always been built on equalizing player power, reducing game prep time to five minutes, and base everything off of dialog. I think it is pretty narrativist, but that term can have very specific meanings to many that don't fit what I do. For instance it doesn't play or feel like an AW game. <br/><br/>If this interests you, send me an email. I know this won't be to everyone's taste. If it is, I want help in tweaking, so the rules are not set. This is a collaboration. I hope it could take SG ideas to a bigger audience like the game Gloom.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444323/#Comment_444323" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T00:57:58+00:00" title="March 20, 2015 12:57AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the rules I've come up with so far. Play tests have gone well.<br/><br/>Anyone interested in doing some play testing?<br/><br/><br/> rules 3/17/15<br/><br/>All the player needs to know<br/><br/>Pick a character and say what happens. Move characters as you speak.<br/>Go around the table adding scenes to the story. Try to connect what you say to what's happened before.<br/>Interrupt at any time to add to or change another player's scene. It automatically happens unless someone asks you to roll for it. You need to roll 7+ on 2d6 to win. Actions that fail WILL NOT happen in the scene.<br/>Players may keep on adding to a scene as long as they wish or until someone starts a new scene. <br/>Be polite, let someone else add to a scene before you offer a second addition. <br/><br/><br/>One player is the host. Their job is to keep the game moving and help new players learn the rules. They also help players out when they can't think of an action. They manage the following rules.<br/><br/>1. The host picks the characters and locations for the game. Lay them on a table, placing characters in locations. The host introduces the scenario and assigns roles to players based on the scenario. <br/><br/>2. Part of the players get the "Success" role. They work to make the heroes succeed. At least one player gets the "Trouble" role. They cause the heroes trouble by making their plans fail and by making the antagonist's plans succeed. It is everyone's job to make the story interesting and entertaining. <br/><br/>3. The host starts the game by pointing out a problem. Players solve the problem through play. The host may suggest new problems at any time. As the players solve problems a coherent story happens. The host may use a pre-written list of problems or make them up as they go along. <br/><br/>4. The host starts play by picking a character, placing a scene token next to them and saying what happens. Move characters as you speak. Make a point of saying what ALL the characters do in the scene. Players describe everything that happens, not just what a single character does. So don't just say what a character does, say what results from it and why.<br/><br/>5. The host demonstrates the rules rather than telling them to the players. People learn fastest by doing. Get the game going immediately rather than spend time teaching the rules.<br/><br/>6. Play goes to the left around the table. The host asks the next player to move the scene token and make up their own scene. Bit by bit a story emerges based on what the players say. Nothing happens in the game except what the players say. <br/><br/>7. Players may interrupt at any time to add to or change another player's scene. They say what they want added. This action automatically happens unless another player asks them to roll for it. The player needs to roll 7+ on 2d6 for their action to succeed. Failed actions do not happen and may not be tried again in that scene (i.e. Until the scene token moves). Players may keep adding to scenes as long as they like. As a matter of politeness players should allow other players to add something before offering a second addition. The host may ask for a new scene when additions start to lag or when they think it's time. <br/><br/>8. The hosts remembers who goes next after all the additions are done. They hand the player the token and ask them to start the next scene.<br/><br/>9. The host should jump in with an addition the first time around the table to demonstrate the rule. They should also ask another player to roll for an action soon after players start making additions.<br/><br/>10. Trouble players cause trouble by the additions and changes they make. The host may need to give them more encouragement at the beginning of the game because causing trouble requires a lot of creativity. The player needs to mess things up to give the game challenge but they don't need to mess up everything. Let things you like happen. Just make certain to complicate things often enough to keep things from being too easy.<br/><br/>11. The host may suggest a new problem at any time. A problem is usually some plot point that moves the story along. If the players act on the suggestion, a coherent plot driven story will emerge. The host may read problems off of a prewritten problem list or make them up based on what the players are doing. It is up to the players as to what they do with the problems. <br/><br/>12. Players may opt to champion a character. They do this by secretly picking a character and then try to make them central to the story. Characters championed by players may not die until the last problem begins. Players must speak up to save their guy if they are threatened. The host needs to clearly say which problem is the last problem so the players know that the blood bath may begin. <br/><br/>12. Throughout the game the host should be helpful and encouraging to the players, especially new players. The host keeps the game moving by reminding the next player that it is their turn. They say "You're up!" When a player makes up a scene the host prompts the other players to make additions and changes by asking "Any additions or changes?" And "Any more?" <br/><br/>13. The host is the voice of reason. They should make changes to all unreasonable actions by the players. The host may also outright veto socially unacceptable actions. Use this power sparingly! For the most part the host has the same kind of power as the other players. The visible exception is when the host suggests problems. The host can have a huge influence on the game by the problems they suggest. A good host can guide games to maximum fun with a few well placed problems.<br/><br/>14. The host should keep a record of the actions in the game. A few notes jotted down will do. Other players are allowed to refer to this event map as needed. <br/><br/>15. Once the last problem is resolved, play goes around the table one last time to tie up loose ends. Players make a statement that settles an unresolved plot point, or says what happens to a character after the story ends. Players may volunteer to go first or the host may pick. The player who goes last has the final say in the game.<br/><br/>16. Optional conflict rule: When a player makes a story that causes a conflict between two players or causes trouble for a number of players, the host  may ask other players to make an argument why a character is not affected by the harm. If the player roll 7+ on 2d6 the character is not hurt.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444364/#Comment_444364" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T13:00:26+00:00" title="March 21, 2015  1:00PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2015 1:00PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds simple enough, but my first reaction is:<br/><br/>What does this have to do with Sherlock Holmes?<br/><br/>It doesn't sound like it would create anything like a Sherlock Holmes story.<br/><br/>Is that one of your goals, or not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444377/#Comment_444377" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T23:42:20+00:00" title="March 21, 2015 11:42PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the basic mechanic for handling scenes, and making anything happen in the game. So it isn't Sherlockian. I use the same mechanic in the guerrilla war scenarios I'm talking about in my other thread. What makes the game Holmesian are the teams and the problems the host comes up with.<br/><br/>Here is how that should work.<br/><br/>Most (usually all but one) player are on the success team. They work to make Holmes solve the case and look brilliant. This is the essence of a Holmes story, I think. One player and the host add trouble to the game. They also want Holmes to succeed but not without work. This provides the pushback that games need. The host starts the game by posing a problem that must be solved. In a mystery it is usually "find clues" but the host can customize it as the game is played so problems flow from the player's actions. If they solve the problems it drives the game in one way. If they ignore problems then bad problems arise.<br/><br/>Posing problems is the toughest task I ask hosts to do. I've decided to rely on skilled referees rather than making it totally generic. It limits who can run the game well but I'm letting go of thinking I'll be making the universal game so that is not critical. I'll provide lists of potential problems but it will not be exhaustive. <br/><br/>The big difference between this and say the "Baker Street" RPG is that you are not running a character. Each player is the story teller and they all share Holmes. I need to play test this to make certain it works but it should be fine.<br/><br/>Gratified to hear your comment that they basic system sounds simple. Narrative games get complex based on what the players do. No need to start off complicated. <br/><br/>I'll let you know how the play tests go. Once I get it written up I'll need outside testers.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444378/#Comment_444378" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-22T01:00:54+00:00" title="March 22, 2015  1:00AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

Love the descriptions of deduction, induction and abduction. I wouldn't say my game is anything more than abduction at best. The goal of the game is to make Holmes look brilliant - so he gets to make those wild leaps, connecting seemingly unrelated observations together. Players make up clues which eventually narrow down who could have done it but the logic comes after the fact. No one knows who is guilty before hand because there is no game master - only a game host.<br/><br/>Next thing for me to do is run a play test, get a new computer to so book design on and get a working test book out there for play testers.
