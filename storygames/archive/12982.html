The example of play shouldn't come from some crazy idealized world where everything is perfect and wonderful.  Instead, it's WAY better, I think, to base it on some actual transcripts of actual play of your game, so you're not promising things that your game hasn't <i>actually delivered</i> at the table.  Sure, definitely you should edit and adjust the transcript show it demonstrates what you want, maybe even merging a bunch of different games together, so you have a super loaded example, but I really think making it real is super important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292638/#Comment_292638" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T13:07:06+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  1:07PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An actual-play example needs to be easy to read and engagingly written.

You're working against the drag of 30 years of bad examples of play here, though, so you have to do something that makes the example of play feel essential, not just clarifying. Otherwise I am liable to gloss over it out of habit (not by choice). <br/><br/>I'm willing to explore outside of David's specific example of typesetting, but I agree, loudly, that the physical presentation of the text is vital to the quality of the example of play.<br/><br/>I might also argue that a modern example of play should also be available as a podcast, no longer than 12 minutes, on the game's website. Said podcast should feature edited-in descriptions of what is happening with the dice and <i>why</i>, like the play-by-play of a poker game aimed at newcomers.

My trick is pretty old hat: Use player and character names A__, B__, C__, etc, and match them to the PC+player. make the PC name obviously fictional and the player name common as rain. So,<br/>* Amy play Adharianna<br/>* Bob play Beofford<br/>* Cary play Corrialina<br/>* Don plays Durkon<br/>(Obviously, the PC names should be appropriate to the game genre, if any; I picked the above for their outlandish fantasy vibes.)<br/><br/>Note the short versus long names, too, for additional distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292871/#Comment_292871" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T12:19:22+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 12:19PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to use that same naming trick, David.

That way, you can glaze over the names while still knowing it is this guys turn or that girl's turn, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292873/#Comment_292873" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T12:22:59+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 12:22PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, that would work--would you also make a character pic, in situation where player v. character distinctions are key (they are for my LARP system, for obvious reasons)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
