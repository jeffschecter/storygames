So:<br/><br/>There's a dead samurai nailed to the mountain rocks. Who is it?<br/>The witches fortress has an elaborately carved iron door depicting sins. One of the carving looks familiar to you - why?<br/>There's a shrine by the side of the road to an ancestor.

The GMs job is to sow those seeds of mistrust and discontent. Take the time to make sure all of the players really understand what their individual Dark Fate means.

We had a great time and the tips above helped a great deal. The mechanics have been grasped and even though fate points aren't exactly flying left and right the mechanic saw some use. <br/>The players, though, felt that introducing story elements of their own and tying them to their fates was hard and didn't really come naturally to them. We play lots and lots of GM-full games so I don't think that lacking experience in improvisation is the biggest reason; I am probably  doing something wrong. Have you had this experience? Are there any common reasons and/or fixes for this problem that you know of? I didn't record the session (and it was in Swedish...) so I guess I can't really give you the information to figure out where I failed but if you have any ideas I would be most grateful!<br/><br/>I use the "And old man sits next to the road, who is it and how do you know him?"-technique a lot and ask players to describe setting elements but apart from answering such questions only a few players took any intitative of their own in creating stuff.<br/><br/>The players said that this session was mostly getting to know the setting and their characters and that the improvising would probably flow better next time but I am not so sure about that. I asked the players to invent a scene or situtation  each, tying into their background or dark fate, to occur next session before reaching the castle walls, do you think this is a good idea? Is there anything else that I can do?<br/><br/>I didn't have one-on-one chats with the players about their dark fates (I thought it would be an entertaining challenge for me to follow and build on the players' foreshadowing without any preset plans), should I have done that?<br/><br/>Best regards!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403749/#Comment_403749" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T13:48:10+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  1:48PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A thing I've found is that players are often much more reticent than they need to be about revealing their Dark Fate. They feel like they'll give the game away if they reveal too much too early, so they clam up and only give out little bits.<br/><br/>In my experience, it's much harder to guess other players' Dark Fates than you think it will be. Also, it works better if some of the Dark Fates are revealed before the final showdown. Everyone wants to save them for the big reveal at the end, but actually the showdown with the Witch works better if most or all of the Fates have been revealed.<br/><br/>Not everything you throw out there is going to catch with one of the players. Just keep trying, and eventually one of them will pick up something you're putting down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403791/#Comment_403791" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T00:33:27+00:00" title="January 16, 2013 12:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>/edited on account of being so damned pretentious<br/><br/>... ignore me.

Right there.  You can do anything... so what do you do?<br/><br/>I told people to think of a character in a movie that they liked, or some story that they've been trying to write, or a character they played before that didn't get to achieve everything he or she wanted.  Usually they just need a little narrowing and they'll start tossing ideas out.  (Most of my players who clammed up were just not very familiar with the ronin genre, so they needed a little extra push to feel welcomed.)<br/><br/>The most rewarding foreshadowing, and also the hardest to guess at sometimes, is the kind of foreshadowing that interests / conflicts with / ties in with other players.  In a sense, I'd tell them to do what you're doing.  Toss a bunch out there, see what people pick up on, and learn the language of the session.<br/><br/>It's often easier to reincorporate all the foreshadowing into a (mostly) coherent story after the fact, even if the individual elements of foreshadowing don't seem related at the time.  "Nono, I told you I was from Owari because I knew you would see it as a lie.  I only meant to shield you from the truth..."<br/><br/>It's very difficult to have a "fate" reveal if you've been stingy with the foreshadowing.  Other players are going to tug at your story additions, and they are going to weave theirs into yours.  If you only present a few things, then later in the game you'll feel too constrained.  You will be forced to be "the guy that kept all his secrets and now it's too late."  That's a fun character to play sometimes, but not if it's your only option.<br/><br/>Lay out a wide base.  Don't worry if people don't engage some of the things you say.  Don't take it personal, and move on.<br/><br/>... again, that's just been my experience.  I'm glad to hear people enjoyed this game!  I'm not surprised at all to hear there was some stumbling early one.  Don't fret.  It's just a game that has to be done a few times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403795/#Comment_403795" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T05:42:24+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  5:42AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "lock in on a vision for my character and start planning to foreshadow and reveal that vision" and the "don't anticipate, just jump onto what happens in play" parts of my brain are fighting each other hard now.<br/><br/>Harlequin's advice is the best I've heard on that front.

In the end the Unholy Pact dude killed the Witch, placed himself on the throne of Mt Fuji and enslaved the sole surviving ronin still true to his mission through a hellish bargain. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for all your help ladies and gentlemen, without you this wouldn't have been possible!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405004/#Comment_405004" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T05:34:31+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  5:34AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great!  It gets better with each game.<br/><br/>What Fates were / were not in play?<br/>What were the "abilities" that the ronin possessed?<br/>Did they cause any (mechanical) tension?  I only ask because sometimes we see that in first games.  It's difficult to know what the abilities "should" be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405244/#Comment_405244" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T14:33:04+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  2:33PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Five players, worst fear wasn't in play.<br/><br/>The abilities only came into play sporadically, probably due to my poor guidance over the choosing process. Here are the ones i can remember (the rest must have been really shitty since I dont think they came into play): Heavenly archery, Knowledge of Spirits, Hide in plain sight, Inventor, Situational awareness, Throwing knives, Battoujutsu, Tracking, Alcoholic. In retrospect I should have worked harder to activate the abilities.<br/><br/>No, no mechanical tension. We most often play less structured free form games and there is genereally not much focus on mechanics (Even if someone overtly cheated the general reaction would probably be somethin like "Oh, cool, we didn't expect that!") so that could be a reason.<br/><br/>I do agree though that choosing abilities was hard and I guess it would have been easier for me to activate players if their abilities had been more straigh forward in suggesting scenes in which they would be useful.<br/><br/>I will think this over and if we decide to play tMW again in the future I will get back with the results from that!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
