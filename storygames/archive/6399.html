I was looking for relationship maps, and found this place:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://news.muckety.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you all know about this place, have been talking about it, and it just hasn't gotten through my thick skull. What's worse, I get there looking at a Harry Potter map there, and I start looking for other story maps. And I'm not seeing many, just lots of maps of newsmakers. And I'm thinking... man, too bad, if there were more maps of plots, this would be a great resource. <br/>\n<br/>\nTook me like ten minutes of looking for it to sink in. As inspiration, what's wrong with a real-world r-map? Not one damn thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo muckety there represents a plethora of ideas for creating interesting situations. Heck, looking at the front page, the whole drama over affairs at the Wall Street Journal is priceless. I may well use that for a scenario design. Change the Journal to an Earldom, and we're off and running, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I high, or has the obvious just sunk in at last? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141595/#Comment_141595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T10:00:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 10:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good find.

What I'm thinking is that you'd replace that organization with a representative NPC from the organization. Think of it as Guild Steersman Edric's sort of role. Make sense? <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone see any problems with creating maps from these? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe general technique that I'm coming up with is to look at the associated story for the conflict in the story. If there isn't any there, really, I move on to another story. A significant percentage that I've come across are simply informational, and don't really contain any conflict. Or perhaps I'm just not seeing the conflict immediately. But that's OK, it's not like you're going to run out of em any time soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eynowd" title="Eynowd"><img alt="Eynowd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eynowd">Eynowd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146315/#Comment_146315" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T20:53:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  8:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>Has anyone actually used any for creating a map for play?

I've seen a bunch of stuff on what relationship maps are (and a little on how to build them), but I don't recall seeing anything on how to actually use one in anger.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just because I have the dumb?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146321/#Comment_146321" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T21:55:20+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  9:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used a relationship map for a Burning Wheel mini-campaign I was running recently, and it was a big help for me.<br/><br/>There were only two characters, but between their own relationships (father, brother, etc.) and the various contacts they made through play, I quickly had like 16-17 characters to keep track of!!<br/><br/>So a simple page with every character's name and title in a box with arrows connecting between characters who knew each other was very useful whenever I wanted to add in a plot twist or have a character pop up into the story again.  I felt like it gave it a real sense of what the character dynamics were like in the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
