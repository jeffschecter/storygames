For the most part, it will use the standard Window Competency Ladder (with the rungs being narrowed a bit, running from d20 down to d6), sport skill groups based on the Basic D&amp;D character classes (yeah, and races as classes), utilize a simplified Window Frame point-buy option, and introduce Role Levels. Now. . . <br/><br/>I really like the PTA concept of characters re-arranging values, rather than growing exponentially more powerful. . . but a total excision of this concept move too far away from D&amp;D for my liking. I'm thinking that each level, characters gain some feeble amount of CPs (per Window Frame) to build up character skills and such each level and are allowed only to upgrade skills in the currently chosen skill group or focused on Ability and, borrowing from PTA (and D&amp;D) that they may shift that focus when they gain a level, as well (either choosing a new skill group or ability to focus on if they so choose). <br/><br/>Now, I'd also like to get some scene-based resolution ala Story Engine in there. Blow by blow resolution is great but The Window can handle broad conflict with just as much aplomb and there is no reason that it shouldn't. I'm not quite certain how I should reconcile this with the traditional hack and slay milieu of D&amp;D but I'm certain that you'll have some ideas (so lay 'em on me). <br/><br/>Also, let's look at treasure. I almost think that <i>players</i> should be able to spend treasure like action points of some kind. I'm fuzzy on the specifics, but it would give treasure a new dynamic other than "money" (because that's boring, dammit). <br/><br/>Much to think about. I'll post more/respond to posts when I have time. Thanks in advance for any input that you may offer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133622/#Comment_133622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T17:10:25+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  5:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Window is based on using polyhedral dice. Clearly, this is the chosen game.<br/><br/>If you want broader resolution for fighty-D&amp;D, I'd suggest porting the combat model of combat stages (everyone moves at once, then spells start, then there's a melee brawl, then spells go off), from <i>FtA</i> and I think Tunnels &amp; Trolls (citation needed).<br/><br/>Another take on fighting could be: everyone involved rolls their relevant die, and the best result of the group is used to reflect their success/failure.

(The Cleric holds back to do a heal spell; the bumps up someone's health back. The Mage is using magic missle; that does some damage to a foe before the fight starts proper.

Rolls made against the general traits will have a lower target number of 4, while those made against specilized skills will have the standard target of 6. So. . . <br/><br/>A character may have a d8 Fighting rating and that's what he'll roll for all combat resolution checks, unless he has some specialized training the Fighter Package (which opens up possibilities like "Two-Weapon Fighting" or "Blindfighting", etc). If he has access to such specialties, he rolls the associated die type against a higher target number of 6. He'll still have a chance of failure, though it will only ever be as great as 1 in 6 as opposed to 3 in 6 (or 50/50).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
