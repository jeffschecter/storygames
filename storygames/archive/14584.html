I have never really played a Larp (unless Jeepform counts, which Jeepform says it doesn't), and my participation at Origins was limited because I was forced to arrive late. I played a boorish neighbor with nothing of his own to contribute, basically a colorful instigator. I played "mildly drunk and offensive" until things heated up, and then I just stepped back and observed.<br/><br/>The whole process has been super interesting and, I think, successful. The Larp itself certainly hangs together and has been fun both times. I started with a charged situation, gave each of eight tightly-intertwined characters a potent secret, and overlaid a simple system for allowing the mechanical revelation of those secrets. That's pretty much it, and it seems to work. <br/><br/>The reason I find this so interesting is that what I thought was a somewhat alien form turns out to be pretty similar to what I'm used to. You build a compelling situation full of characters pointed at each other and stand back, trusting your players. The physicality and mobility of the form work to your advantage, since players can create their own spaces and arenas for social conflict. At Origins Evan commandeered a seminar room, but during the game players quickly established a game geography that extended out into the hall (a stand-in for the California desert). You can sort of hand-wave this in tabletop, but in Larp it is pretty cool to see player autonomy in this area.<br/><br/>It's also fascinating to see multiple "games" happening at once - three players peel off and conspire in the kitchen while other knots from on the porch or in the desert. They return, recombine, cluster and disperse. Each interaction is essentially unsupervised, guided by very simple rules. Secrets bleed out, or are forced out, or are gossiped out. This isn't something tabletop play really replicates well, but that Larp (at least lil' parlor Larps) seems to do effortlessly.<br/><b><br/>Larpers, what else does the form "bring to the table"? (sorry). What have your experiences - particularly revelatory experiences related to how we play - been with Larping?</b><br/><br/>If anyone wants to playtest my parlor Larp, let me know. It's based on George Adamski's mid-century flying saucer cult and is easy to stage as a 1957 dinner party.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332137/#Comment_332137" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T15:56:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  3:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>It's also fascinating to see multiple "games" happening at once - three players peel off and conspire in the kitchen while other knots from on the porch or in the desert.

In a tabletop game, action is equated with information, and the flow of information is centralized.  In a traditional tabletop rpg, everything flows in and out of the GM.  In a GMless game, everything flows in and out of the table's consensus or through other structures the game creates.  But in a larp, action and information flow are decentralized.  Things happen in other areas that you are unaware of.  Even as GM, you never know everything that's going on.  People step to the side and plot or have a conversation that would be a distracting sideline in tabletop.  Or we hatch a plot to stop another player's plans, which wouldn't work at all if they were sitting right next to me listening in.<br/><br/><br/>Since the flow of action and flow of information is decentralized, it makes secrets and deception much more viable.  Maybe it's my personal experiences and biases, but I've never been really satisfied with tabletop games where one player kept secrets from the others. (GMs not being counted as players here.)  I'd always prefer that the players know everything that is going on, even if the character do not.  But for larps, things seem different: you acting in secret won't require me sitting around bored while you consult the GM.  And my understanding of the game will always be partial and fragmentary anyway, so secrets, mysteries and uncertainties automatically fit into that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332140/#Comment_332140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T16:06:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  4:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The secrecy angle seems critical - hidden information is the "GM in a box" that can drive play. <br/><br/>Perfect transparency works well at the table, and works well in Jeepform (although Jeepform does secrecy as well).

If not, why not?</blockquote>\nTo my mind, the distinction between LARP and Jeepform is that Jeepform has scene framing like tabletop, where only one conversation or line of action is going on at once.  LARP is defined by generally remaining in character and in place - with "time outs" and out-of-character space being exceptions.  If you have people regularly dropping in and out of the scene, then it isn't really a LARP as I would define it.  So while you can have a lot of transparency, you generally can't have the 100% transparency of tabletop or Jeepform.  <br/><br/>There is some overlap, of course.  If characters don't split off or whisper to each other, then you have that transparency.  The Mothers is called a Jeepform, but I think it is also a LARP because you don't drop out of character.  In game, the characters are all addressing the support group rather than freely socializing.  <br/><br/>For me, the 100% being in character is the strength of LARP.  Moreso than tabletop, it tends to focus on the internal dilemmas of each character rather than external action.  I find that as I'm going into a LARP, I am much more concerned about the personality &amp; background of the character I will get as than in tabletop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332191/#Comment_332191" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T01:38:47+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  1:38AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Don't put too much weight on definitions. Some N\xf8rwegian Style roleplaying games are called mini-larps by larpers, and are functionally nearly identical to what some Polish designers call jeeps. I say potato, you say D20.)<br/><br/>My experiences with larp (which are random, sporadic and cover a bunch of different forms) have revealed that... interaction between two players in character is the strongest experience I get in roleplaying. It is easier to get this focused play in larp, because you're in character with your entire body, and there are usually less meta-techniques and breaks in the fiction. Also, moving about while in character &amp; in costume/mask makes you feel more like your character. This is good and bad; physical scenes get more real and intense, but tend to trump a lot of other things. In Nordic larp, there's a lot of intensity and maybe not enough reflection, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332196/#Comment_332196" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T03:14:26+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  3:14AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, I'm enjoying your observations.

We noticed a few things:<br/>- some players have to be given a reason to reveal their secrets<br/>- having some kind of overarching mechanic* strongly encourages appropriate play<br/>- it's best if players can resolve things between themselves without involving a GM, quickly too.<br/><br/>You are less likely to need these things if everyone is on the same page but in a room of 25-30 where you don't know everyone and there are only 2 GMs it's important to get a robust structure.<br/><br/>*In the Soap Opera LARP we had a Hot or Not board. You unlocked extra abilities if you were hot and you got hot by being noticed by the press, ie GMs. People competed to be hot up to staging fights.<br/><br/>The HP LARP was a strange one. Paula, my wife, had written much of an HP LARP and then we went to someone else's. The guy running it didn't show. He had sent everyone their characters in advance so we used them to run our LARP instead. We had only a very rough idea of what might happen. The rule for quidditch, for example, was "everyone runs around a lot then HP wins". I GM'ed as Snape and ran a potions class. I did this by telling everyone off and then leaving for 10 minutes. When I came back Hufflepuff had summoned Cthulhu. It was great. The fact that everyone was familiar with HP and knew the tropes meant we could play a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332204/#Comment_332204" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T04:28:19+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  4:28AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also very interested in the ways Larp scales - what factors in a parlor Larp of 8 become untenable when you have thirty players?

It worked well, I think partially because I assigned some roles that were actually mini-GMs - somebody was the charge nurse with the keys to the Pyxis machine and the "students" had to interact with her, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332207/#Comment_332207" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T05:10:08+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:10AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my experience has been with managing long running (even multi-year), player driven larps. I personally think that sandbox techniques work better for the long form than organizer-centric, "plot of the session" approaches. In that vein, I tolerate larp one shots, but I don't think they can take full advantage of the form. <br/><br/>When playing I enjoy the theatricality, which can let me immerse in the performance, whether mine or someone else's - which (to me) is more fun than just immersing into the character. The distributed nature of play also provides enticing partial information, ideally even for the organizer. Which leads to a social ritual of after larp dinning and talking, and essential part of at my larp experiences. <br/><br/>Design-wise, building better distributed larp systems has been a goal of mine for years. My ideal is a fully self-organizing larp system. <br/><br/>Jason, as for scaling, I've ported over some analyses and approaches from distributed computing. Much of it involves avoiding the coupling and bottlenecks that are largely irrelevant in table-top RPGs, so that each dynamically forming subgroup of players can be autonomous and create fiction which will be shared as they break apart and form into other subgroups. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332208/#Comment_332208" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T05:24:27+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did once run a LARP at work, although I didn't tell them that. I called it a business game. Again there were around 30 of us. I'm an analyst in Government. At that time I had a team of four analysts working in a policy group charged with benefit fraud policy. My team of analysts were GMs. Again, I didn't tell them that. The rest of the section were split into three groups representing the three groups involved in policy delivery, policy, delivery and analysis. There was, and still is I hope, a commitment to evidence based policy (rather than policy based evidence which happens all too often).<br/><br/>The idea of the game was to look at the flow of policy from the minister (played by me) through the policy group to the delivery group. Each group had one of my team as a GM who would respond to their questions, tell them how long it would take to do things and feed them bad news. We didn't decide in advance what the bad news was, just that each GM had to make things harder as thing went along so key staff going off sick, by-elections, money problems, even bad weather, all were valid interruptions to the smooth working of things.<br/><br/>The upshot of the game was that as the pressure was piled on from the top down and things started to go wrong, and people forgot to do things, the amount of work that the analysts were asked to do increased dramatically with ever shortening deadlines to the extent that the person playing the lead analyst told a policy person to "fuck off". Obviously this was exactly what I hoped might happen and for some months afterwards, policy people were much better at interacting with analysts.<br/><br/>Again, the common framework, as with the HP LARP above, meant that it was easy to get everyone involved in the game, immersed even in many cases, without having spend much time at all explaining the rules. I hardly did anything except to reassure my team of GMs occasionally and to pile pressure on the policy people by changing the deadlines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332228/#Comment_332228" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T07:53:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:53AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Whilte Wolf LARP for about 5 years, we had upwards of 40-50 people at our monthly events at our peak.

And of course vice-versa. For me, writing something for eight players was comfortably close to home, but thirty seems so different.</blockquote>\nA common rule of thumb for developing larger pregen games is to use threes.<br/><br/>Give each character 3 particularly strong connections to other characters. Often, one strong ally, one strong enemy, and one other (like a reliable contact or a person to protect or something else).<br/><br/>Give each character 3 discrete goals. One that's pretty easy to accomplish. One that's challenging but doable. And a third that is really hard, where the odds are stacked heavily against success.<br/><br/>A preference that I personally have - use props instead of "secrets". I've played in far too many pregen games where players had secrets on their sheet but no reason to tell them to anyone. And I've had especially little success when playing games like that with people who are strangers outside of the game. I find repeatedly that many players are willing to share with their OOC friends but not with OOC strangers.<br/><br/>So instead, I prefer games that focus more on prop trading. Even if the props are just pieces of paper. So if you're trying to blackmail someone, your goal is to get the piece of paper that has "compromizing photos of the Govenor", on it, rather than trying to convince someone to tell you something that they have no incentive to share. And in exchange, you have other prop cards with things on them that other people are looking for.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you're going to have currency in the game, it needs to mean something specific. Like, multiple characters need to have goals to collect certain amounts of money either before the end of the game or in order to do something midway through the game. Or, the currency needs to "power" something.<br/><br/>Just a few weeks ago I played in a game that did both. It was called Limbo! and it was basically a cocktail karaoke party in Hell. Mortals could generate the currency, called Soul, though creative acts - primarily by singing a karaoke song. Angels and Demons could use Soul to trigger their special powers. Plus, several people were trying to collect Soul to do a couple big things. Plus, everyone needed Soul to buy drinks (real drinks, yay!). Overall, it was the most impressive use of currency in a one-shot larp I have seen to date. It felt more like real currency than in pretty much any short larp I've played, because everyone needed at least a little of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332271/#Comment_332271" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T11:22:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 11:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2011 11:23AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Yes I do.

The need for a RSVP was the only organizing thing we did.  Since the White Wolf game was set up so that we could just take however many people showed up, asking for people for an RSVP so that we could get the correct number of Star Wars/Cthulhu/cheesy 80s teen slasher flick characters together turned out to be a pretty big barrier to entry. People were used to just showing up whenever with whoever. So the one-shots were "only" around 20-25 people or so.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I'd also like to know whether you created scratch-built rules for the one-shots, went with some sort of no-rules-necessary approach on the one-shots (they were mostly social, for example), or if you used some kind of hybridized or simplified WW rules, since presumably folks playing the one-shots also played the WW MET stuff.</blockquote>\nWe had a very simple resources-based system that had some similarities to some parts of MET/the bidding of adjectives related to the character became, for example, in our Star Wars diplomatic LARP, the advancement of different resources and influences over factions on various planets in the cluster.  We also used Cthulhu Live for one of them, which is a pretty standard game.  Early on in the life of the LARP, we did a game where people just carried dice and a character sheet with them.  That couldn't scale up because of the relative lack of flat surfaces where people were sneaking off to contend with each other.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>How many cooks were involved with makng the one-shots, and how did the brainstorming, character creating, structure creation workload fall into place?</blockquote>\nThe aforementioned Star Wars LARP was one hundred percent my baby, everything that was done, I did, from character packets to system creation to everything.  Most of them were actually one- or two-person shows where collaboration was on every aspect of the game.  When you're "only" talking about 20-25 people, it's more a time commitment than a task delegation issue.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>How did you advertise/recruit for the one-shots?</blockquote>\nWe mentioned them at our White Wolf events. At the time, we were by far the biggest LARP in town, there weren't any boffer folks around and all the game store people hated all the LARP people, so there was no point advertising anywhere else game-related.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In what sort of environments/locations did the one-shots occur? How did this contrast with the WW MET stuff you were playing on a regular basis.</blockquote>\nPeople's houses, apartment complex gathering areas, a public park...no contrast, more or less the same places the WW LARPs were occurring.<br/><br/>There seems to be this idea that there was some contrast between (say) the Star Wars LARP and the White Wolf LARP organizationally?  There wasn't, both were created and run exactly the same way, organizationally.  The main difference in the play experience was continuity and creating your own character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332274/#Comment_332274" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T11:27:30+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 11:27AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>A common rule of thumb for developing larger pregen games is to use threes.</blockquote>\nYes.

Those who have positions of authority in game are also expected to help organize their fellow faction members in an out of game way. Factions also help drive characterization - your faction and your role within that faction constitute a lot of "who you are". <br/><br/>I know at least some of the make heavy use of the game economy to drive action. Aquiring resources and creating beneficial things with those resources drive a lot of play. And GMs messing with the supply constitute one of the main toggles the GMs use to make things happen. Once you get to big numbers (50+ players) and multiple events, a well designed game economy can drive a lot of interesting play. Interesting for some players, at least - not everyone cares.<br/><br/>Also, the advancement system is often driven by character interaction. So if you want to learn the advanced levels of the blacksmithing skill, for example, you have to find a master smith in game to teach you. And perhaps he'll charge you a big chunk of money for it. So now you need to do stuff to make that money, like make your lower level smithing goods and sell them. So now you have stuff to do for a while. Or, if he's charging too much, maybe you want to search around for a different one. Or maybe you can find out a favor you can do for him that might cover some or all of the tuition, like aquire coal for running the forge, which has recently become scarce. All kinds of possibilities generated dynamically by the combination of the advancement system and the economy.<br/><br/>Another thing to keep in mind for huge events is not to be a one trick pony. Not even a 2 or 3 trick pony. When you have large player bases, you have tons of different player motivations present - your player base becomes less and less homogenous. So you need to provide (or otherwise encourage) lots of very different types of activities to make different players happy.<br/><br/>I wrote an <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14484&amp;page=1#Comment_329743" rel="nofollow">Article on Player Motives</a> that describes 16 relatively granular player motives that are commonly present among larp players and that can be directly addressed in design. In a huge, ongoing game, all of them will be present to some degree among some portion of the player base.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332300/#Comment_332300" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T13:42:04+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  1:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Adam, the part that interest me most is how much "stuff" each role gets in a 60 person event.

Particularly when you can copy and paste several public personas and secrets.  <br/><br/>Say you're running larp set at the United Nations, which is riddled with spies and counterspies and diplomats and such.  This gives you a variety of factions, jobs and secrets to work with.  A player might receive a canned bit of text given to each character from France, a canned bit of text about being a diplomat and a secret role of being a paid assassin.  Each of those is given out to a couple other players as well, but no one gets all three the same.  Suppose you write 4 public factions (US, France, Russia, starving African nation), four jobs (diplomat, security, politician, bureaucrat) and four secrets (assassin, spy, terrorist, embezzling from the UN).  well, you've now written 12 bits of information... only about 4 character sheets worth, total.  But you've generate 64 characters.  <br/><br/><br/>(This is what I understand of how some large larps handle things.  My games all have been under 20 people, which is a scale where one person can easily generate enough unique characters.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332327/#Comment_332327" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T16:19:23+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  4:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, it should be noted that, in general, the more players there are, the less the characters are generated by the GMs. Or at least, as Nick gave a great example of, the less unique characterization the individual characters get.<br/><br/>Even when designers are actually creating full character sheets for big pregen games, they typically use more systems and structures to aid them the larger the game is.<br/><br/>For example, if a designer wanted to write up the 64 characters that Nick described but give each of them some unique story, they might assign, say, 2 personality traits and a backstory incident from random lists that they can use to help inspire them as they write up 64 different backgrounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_332402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332402/#Comment_332402" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T01:42:51+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wrote a manifesto on larp some years ago (1999?), titled <b><a href="http://www.fabula.no/manifest.html" rel="nofollow">The Key Manifesto</a></b>.

Here's what we do locally: most of our Storytellers/GMs have OOC briefings of a sort before each game, and issue "news bulletins" about the various plots going on (often written on a white board - nothing revelatory, just signs that people have seen of odd things happening), which we can then choose to investigate or not as we see fit. During the briefings they also say which GM to go to for each plot (as we usually have multiple GMs). Then everyone goes to a single, large room that's set up as a common area and mingles in character. When individuals or groups then decide to investigate a plot, they go to the appropriate GM and go off into another room to check it out.<br/><br/>It's a fairly efficient system, but it has its flaws. For one thing, as you can no doubt tell, it's pretty obvious when plot-related stuff is happening. I've GMed some of our ongoing LARPs before, so I know that issue can be worked on, but it's an uphill battle. Our main issue, I think, is that we got so used to the way we run things that when we go to investigate a plot, we sit down in the new room and it becomes more like a tabletop game.  Frankly, I think it's because we play too often (each game is usually twice a month in these parts, though I've been WAY too busy with school and such for the last few months to be able to play, myself).<br/><br/>When there's more time between games, there can be more planning for them and you can potentially have more cool and engaging things going on (both plotwise and with props, costumes, etc) - plus, the sessions become... well, for lack of a better word, more "special." When a LARP becomes routine I think that's when its fire starts going out.<br/><br/>I'd actually like to try more one-shots, parlor LARPs, pub crawls and the like for that reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332650/#Comment_332650" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T07:13:47+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  7:13AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jim!

As someone mentioned up thread, there is a serious trend in larps to have people button up and hang onto their secrets. In a larp Julia Ellingboe and I wrote (What to do About Tam Lin?), the framework was a trial in which people narrated and acted out past actions. Gave everyone a venue for revealing secrets as well as a setting the emphasized pressuring folks for them, and encouraging the reveal. <br/><br/>From what I've heard about plotting out big larps, sticky notes are a larpwright's best friend! Though plotting is more like the 3 connections and 3 goals, rather than what events are slated to happen. The decentralized aspect of larp is full of potential. My favorite aspect of it is the expectation of character interaction. Being in the roles is a large part of the joy of the game. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite> The rule for quidditch, for example, was "everyone runs around a lot then HP wins". </blockquote>\nBeautiful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332671/#Comment_332671" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T08:09:54+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my 8-character parlor Larp, a player can walk up to another player and straight-up demand to know their secret twice during the game (you obviously spring this in private).

What I've typically seen happen is that they get together a few days ahead of time just to make sure everyone's on the same page, but aside from that each ST generates their own plot. Some nights, though, there'll just be one ST, so they'll try to set things in motion so that (ideally) there'll be enough player-based conflict/discussion that they can run it by themselves.  Some nights, there'll end up being players hanging loose with nothing to do, so the ST will grab someone who's on the Storytelling staff but hadn't planned to run that night by the shoulders and cry, "For god's sake, HELP me!!" (or words to that effect) and that suddenly recruited ST will try to run something spontaneously to help keep things flowing while the main ST is busy.<br/><br/>What I tried to do when I was running Mage: the Awakening was to have regular meetings with a couple of other STs I'd recruited and sort out different plot elements and their connections to each other.  I'd give each assistant a very general plot to run that they'd be able to fill in the details for (so basically it'd be bullet points: "it would be cool if we can get X, Y and Z to happen, but HOW they happen will be up to you and the players").  Then at the next meeting (after there'd been another game session) we'd regroup, talk about what happened at the previous game and figured out where things would go from there, how the plots would intersect, etc.  We were able to get a couple of seemingly unrelated plots to crisscross pretty nicely that way.<br/><br/>I had planned to put together a sort of "plot web" that would make the thing more sandboxy (seed things all over and then move in whatever direction the players yanked us), but sadly there wasn't enough time before I got busy with school and had to stop running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332710/#Comment_332710" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:16:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Thanks Jim!

The PCs had largely organized into their own groups, so from time to time between sessions we'd take a group or individual and run them through some things in tabletop.  After a while, though, there ended up being a LOT of it going on, so we defaulted to using the LARP rules (though in all other aspects it remained largely tabletoppy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332711/#Comment_332711" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:20:46+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:20AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that the lowering the number of reveals will make allying with other players more important.

If you know half of the secrets in the game, you can find a player whose goals don't hurt yours too much, and get them to ally with you and reveal the other half of the game.

With fewer reveals, you'd need two or more trustworthy allies to discover what's going on... but you'll have a hard time finding them.

The con these games were run at has a big advantage: they pre-cast months in advance, with long write ups on the website. (<a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org/L/" rel="nofollow">Intercon</a>) You even fill out casting surveys to assist the GMs in putting you into a given role, which really spell it out. The questions might be things like "do you mind being dead/a murderer/full of hate/optimistic" etc. You have a pretty good idea of what your role will be after you fill out the survey, and then they usually send you the characters some time in advance (not always though!), which again, gives you a clear picture of what the expectations are. <br/><br/>As a GM you are looking for people who want to play the heavy. Also, since people have a history with this style of play, they know what to expect and look forward to having that opportunity. I remember talking to one fellow who played a particularly awesome villain. He said he intentionally hid at first to give people something to look for, then revealed with a heavy hand, then looked forward to getting nailed by the rest of the group. That is a team player. <br/><br/>For the horde specifically, there was a good explanation about the differences between the roles. I've never played a main cast role in a Horde larp, but I find I love the quick changes, and the opportunities to play against many other players. It's a bit terrifying since you don't know what you'll get next, but then, you don't have to play them long. Also, these  folks have well proven techniques for communicating the roles during play. Usually there is a dedicated "horde gm" who assigns characters. That person brings out the character groups in turn, and waits until they have the minimum number of players to fulfill that plot group. And sometimes they are handed out more piecemeal if the characters pretty much all fit together, as in the Purgatory larp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332724/#Comment_332724" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:51:30+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:51AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Has anyone ever played in a LARP where there were many more NPCs than you'd usually think of in a LARP?</blockquote>\nWe did a Vampire LARP one time in which only 3 people played their normal characters.

We then created around 10 NPCs who were influential people in Tucson (the mayor, a big financier, etc.) and threw them all together at a high society party.

Generate two or three circles of Fiasco characters, then add a few relationship between the circles and write the characters up.  Instant larp.  But that's not exactly what you mean.<br/><br/><br/>We had a few larps that tried to integrate PCs from ongoing tabletop game, and they were a bit problematic.  The goals of a one-shot parlor larp (discover secrets, resolve the plot in a single session) conflict with those of an ongoing game (work as a party, have an ongoing plot for a long time).    Several characters at one point realized that they could trust the other characters from their tabletop party, but couldn't trust anyone else.  So they banded together and quickly shut down the other character's plots and acts.  (This is very similar to what the MIT larp group calls the "Good Guy Mob", when people figure out that they're all the good guy characters of the larp with the same goals, and go around trouncing any disagreeing characters.)<br/><br/>I could see a parallel tabletop game working much better with the ongoing campaigns of NERO larpers or Camarilla games or the like, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332729/#Comment_332729" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T10:00:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 10:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, that's super interesting.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't heard of horde games. Thanks for introducing me to that concept, Emily.<br/><br/>The biggest NPC to PC ratio I've seen or heard about in games are in birthday games.<br/><br/>A big group of gamers decides to put on a special game for their buddy on their birthday. Depending on the scenario, you may have a few people teamed up with the birthday person as fellow PCs, but generally they treat the birthday person as the team leader.<br/><br/>So it's easy in that situation to get lots of people to come out and play NPCs, because they are giving their time and energy as their gift to the birthday person.<br/><br/>Birthday larps are traditionally done as surprise parties. The birthday person may know they are going to a party, but they don't know it's going to be a larp starring them. <br/><br/>They are often "alternate reality" scenarios, where the birthday person is playing themselves swept into a dramatic story that fits in with mostly normal reality, like a spy story or maybe a Doctor Who story. Or zombies. Zombies are always good.<br/><br/>One of these years I should do one for my son. He's starting to get to know a pretty big group of adult larpers, and they all think he's awesome. I bet I could get a pretty big group of them to be in a game for him. The biggest challenge would be that his birthday is in January, which makes weather unpredictable. Chance of rain is pretty high in California. But, on a selfish note, my birthday is 2 days away from my son's, so throwing a larp party for him would basically be throwing a party for me at the same time.

You can break down the factions into groups of just 3-5 people.  This is useful to you as organizer in that you can set up relationships to a faction instead of just a person.  So a character background might specify "You resent all of the Hatfields for their part in your father's trial."  <br/><br/>And a good rule of thumb is:  if it helps you as organizer to keep relations straight, then it helps players keep relations straight.  <br/><br/>One of the trickiest parts that I have with larp is in casting.  Because the character you play is so important, assigning characters to players is vital.  However, secrets can cause problems for this - like if you have a character who seems like a peace-loving journalist but is actually a ruthless spy for a foreign power.  How do you cast people as these, especially if you don't know them well?  I don't have a consistent answer for this.  <br/><br/>Shifting Forest Storyworks has a system where the 8 characters are all rated on three scales: Light/Dark, Goal-oriented/Emotion-oriented, and Simple/Complex.  So rather than going by individual characters, players could specify what type they want.  That was useful, and I might want to extend it for larger larps, or those with different dividing lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332877/#Comment_332877" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T11:25:47+00:00" title="July  2, 2011 11:25AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>One of the trickiest parts that I have with larp is in casting.

And favoring the people you know with awesome, central characters and giving the secondary roles to to people you don't know, which leads to groups being unwelcoming to newcomers.<br/><br/>For Jason's larp, everyone has a public person, which we let them pick, and then a randomly assigned secret.  That's one way to avoid the problem.<br/><br/>I'll have to try out the Shifting Forest system for picking characters.  You could have some players who identify that one character's public face doesn't seem to match the tone or complexity listed on the packet.  But maybe that's not a problem: They'd appear friendly but with more going on behind the scenes, like in a movie where someone acts very trustworthy but the camera angles and music tell the audience not to trust them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When writing a larp, it's good practice to have be expandable (accept more or fewer players as needed) and to have the characters prioritized so you know who to cut in a smaller group.  And to have a few characters that can be played as either gender.  At least, that's been my experience: players are fickle creatures who cancel or arrive unexpectedly at the last minute.  I guess these issues aren't an issue for "bring your own character" ongoing larps.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Going back to an earlier point, I think that factions are useful even for small larps of 8-12 people.

This isn't to disagree so much as it is to say that faction should have some bits of internal tension (Who is in control?  Which way should our faction move in political context?  Is Jim's character a double agent for another faction?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332882/#Comment_332882" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T12:13:54+00:00" title="July  2, 2011 12:13PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><br/>And if you do know people well and do the casting yourself, there are dangers of typecasting players.<br/>----<br/>Is Jim's character a double agent for another faction?</blockquote>\nStrangely enough, yes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Something like this happened to me at a couple of conventions, but the funny thing is that I was a total stranger to the people running the games.  In two separate games (a Deadlands LARP and a Cthulhu LARP) I came into it without any particular requests for characters or expectations and both times was handed an envelope containing the character who turned out to be the villain.  Prior to the first LARP, I'd never met any of the people involved, then some of the people from the first LARP were involved in the second.  And it seems both times they decided to have me play the bad guy (who on both occasions was pretending to be a good guy).  I'm still not sure why.  They didn't know me and as far as I'm aware I hadn't given them any reason to think I'd be good at that kind of character.  Maybe it was my goatee. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14584/so-larp" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14584/so-larp" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14584/so-larp/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14584%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14584%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
