It does have some inherent limitations.  I've been trying to design games that were specifically episodic in format, like <i>Law &amp; Order</i> or something, where you could catch an episode and miss and bunch and later still feel like you could watch the show and know what was going on.  Still, there is something to be said for short story arcs of 3-4 sessions or even longer "seasons" of play.  I don't think I could go back to open-ended play, where there's no set ending in mind, but I do miss games where you have a somewhat longer amount of time to let things brew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86904/#Comment_86904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T07:34:42+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  7:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 7:36AM by lumpley.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there's something really important that happens between the first session and the second, and then something else that's also pretty important that happens between the second and the third.<br/><br/>I think this is also true of board games! Like, I'm playing Carcassonne, and between our first game night and our next a week later the game <i>sinks in</i> in an important way. I figure something out about the tiles and the little wooden people and how they fit together. The thing is, with a roleplaying game, the tiles and the little wooden people are the fictional characters and situation, as well as just the game's rules. It's not that The Mountain Witch sinks in, it's that <i>our game</i> of The Mountain Witch sinks in.<br/><br/>That's my take. Playing only oneshots is like never playing the same board game again. You never get the downtime your mind needs to figure the game out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86905/#Comment_86905" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T07:35:05+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  7:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaming Diets are different, I think.

My initial thoughts on why the lack of a totally satisfying experience (for me) involves several reasons.<br><br>First, a lack of familiarity with the rules among the players.  Most storygames aren't as complex as D&amp;D, but nonetheless there can be a significant ramp up time.  Explanation and questions eat into game time and drain energy from the participants.  And many storygames depend on all the mechanics be employed for a full experience (e.g. how well will PTA work if people aren't throwing that Fanmail around like they should?).  Some even require that the players be familiar with a variety of techniques (scene framing, stake setting, flags, bangs, kickers, etc) to get full benefit.  I note that a fair amount of play at SG games gets drifted or plays with abbreviated rules to ease new players into the game.<br/><br/>Another problem is the expectation level.  At a con the person running the scenario usually has done a fair amount of prep work, has support materials for players (e.g. DITV town sheet, character sheets, etc), and is intimately familiar with the system.  In addition, the players aren't coming after a day of work - they're coming relatively fresh and ready to play.  SGBoston by comparison has lower expectations (people aren't paying to play) so there is less onus for the facilitator to be prepared.  In addition, for participants it can be hard work after a full day to try to get your head around how a new system functions.  I know I usually bring a half-dozen different games just to make sure I have something that will appeal - but that means I'm less familiar or prepared to run any single game.  And if I play a new game I'm starting with general, but unfocused, enthusiasm.  I can't be truly excited to play "X" if I've know nothing of "X".  I'm literally waiting to see the "awesome" and expecting the facilitator to show it to me soon and thereby justify my choice.<br/><br/>I think trust or familiarity can also be an issue.  I frequently play with people I've only just met - I'm uncertain of their preferences, taboos, gaming experience, strengths, weaknesses, etc.  I don't know how they like to play or how best to play with them.  I'm sure they have the same issue with me.<br/><br/>To address your initial question - I think one shots can make for very satisfying gaming.  But I think one-shots with people you're familiar with, who know the rules, and who come energized to play a specific game (or at least have previous experience with the game in question to inform them) will produce more satisfying play.<br/><br/>I also think that many games (story games included) have subtleties that only become clear through longer play (like PTA's spotlight structure, or BW Artha).  So I also believe there are areas where one-shots cannot replace a multi-session experience.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86912/#Comment_86912" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T07:59:41+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  7:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'd go crazy if I had only one-shots.

One shots are like short stories or movies in my mind. When well done, they are focused, powerful and elegant. There's also a freedom to take the game to your limits in a one shot because if a game turns in a way one of the participants doesn't care for, it's just one game session.<br/><br/>At the same time, a longer form game has a lot going for it, like a novel or a serial television show with serious chops, like The Wire. Games in this format have the potential to reach a level of depth, nuance and subtlety that you can't get in a one shot. There's something about the slow boil, allowing the elements of the game to mix and take on a unique flavor, that is uniquely satisfying.<br/><br/>I want to be able to have both types of experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86932/#Comment_86932" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T08:54:01+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  8:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mind a one-shot every now and then, but greatly prefer long term campaigns.

One-shots are tons of fun as everyone has said, and as important to me, they are crucial to the future of gaming.  In short, <i> the one-shot is the gateway drug to gaming.</i>  If every new GM felt  they had to come with an elaborate campaign with a ton of maps, plots and NPCs then I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t  think there would be as many new GMs.**  Similarly, if every potential new player felt they had to commit to 10 sessions just to try \xe2\u20ac\u0153this-thing-you-call-gaming-and-roleplaying,\xe2\u20ac\x9d they may not even bother. Not to mention, is one game out of an on-going 20 game story arc the best way to suck new players in? This is also why I think game publishers need to publish excellent one-shot adventures for their games, but they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t because they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s profitable and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a different thread (of wrath).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne-shots are only one part of the balanced gaming diet though because as Flynn says, it can be all wind-up and no pitch.  If you spent 5 hours making characters and learning the game and 2 hours playing, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no good.  As a player you won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get as much story or investment in the game or you character.  You finally get to love and understand your character\xe2\u20ac\xa6 and then you never see him again. As a GM, without more game sessions with the same game, you can't tell as much story and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hard to apply the lessons learned from the first game.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve run one-shots where I knew I had screwed some stuff up and I really wanted to get back on the horse and run a better second game... except there was no second game.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I participated in a Run Club  (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/39/run-club/" rel="nofollow">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/39/run-club/</a>) which was designed get people who didn't GM to try it.  Everyone GMs a one-shot and everyone plays in everyone else's game.  I'll let the link do most of the explaining.  Some have GM-ed  more since then, and others are still mainly players, but everyone got a glimpse of life behind the screen which I think helps you become a better player regardless if you ever GM again.

In short,<em>the one-shot is the gateway drug to gaming.</em>If every new GM felt  they had to come with an elaborate campaign with a ton of maps, plots and NPCs then I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t  think there would be as many new GMs.**  Similarly, if every potential new player felt they had to commit to 10 sessions just to try \xe2\u20ac\u0153this-thing-you-call-gaming-and-roleplaying,\xe2\u20ac\x9d they may not even bother. Not to mention, is one game out of an on-going 20 game story arc the best way to suck new players in? This is also why I think game publishers need to publish excellent one-shot adventures for their games, but they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t because they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s profitable and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a different thread (of wrath).<br/><br/>One-shots are only one part of the balanced gaming diet though because as Flynn says, it can be all wind-up and no pitch.  If you spent 5 hours making characters and learning the game and 2 hours playing, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no good.  As a player you won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get as much story or investment in the game or you character.  You finally get to love and understand your character\xe2\u20ac\xa6 and then you never see him again. As a GM, without more game sessions with the same game, you can't tell as much story and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hard to apply the lessons learned from the first game.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve run one-shots where I knew I had screwed some stuff up and I really wanted to get back on the horse and run a better second game... except there was no second game.</blockquote>\nAlso, there are those who simply can't get their head into a new character space in less than, say, several weeks. I play regularly with a couple of people who are really heavily develop-in-play, so in the first session of a game, their character is pretty much a cipher (in both senses of the word), and they don't contribute much to the inter-character dynamics, and don't get much out of the session themselves. These same players are also the quickest to pick up new rules, but they need long-term play to get any real satisfaction. So, while i can put together a great one-shot (after all the convention running, i've had to learn the skills, whether i was good at it to begin with or not), even a proven one-shot scenario with a system i created (and am thus intimately familiar with) falls flat with this group. <br/><br/>[and, no i have no idea why this post is just being made now.

We're about 8 sessions in now, and it is a blast.  It's so nice to have a backlog of NPCs for everybody to draw upon.

That diet has been sprinkled liberally with \xe2\u20ac\u0153Atkins diet\xe2\u20ac\x9d one, two, and three shot gaming. As someone put it those were \xe2\u20ac\u0153episodic\xe2\u20ac\x9d (in some cases they were STOS, and STNG RPGs designed to simulate a single episode, or occasionally a two-parter), or a variety of board games intended for a single session of play. Other single session gaming took place with the campus gaming club. I viewed those as one offs, and literally played some of them only once.<br/><br/>Longer gaming campaigns seem to me to offer an experience similar to that of a dedicated fan watching/reading an entire serial, SG, Lord of the Rings, etc., while the few session games seem more like the Law &amp; Order example given above. While I like both, I have to say, as a fan of L&amp;GSVU that even in the episodic experience it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s nice to have a recurring character come up from old episodes, even if another actor might be playing them.<br/><br/>On the same note, with "comfort food" open-ended gaming I've experienced what can only be described as a series that would have been better cancelled after its third season...<br/><br/>Brad                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
