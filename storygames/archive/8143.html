After the fever broke I became fascinated by what soap operas had to do, logistically, to keep going constantly for year after year, and started making some notes. I highly recommend watching a week of a soap opera and taking notes to anyone who is interested in ongoing stories.<br/><br/>Here is what I discovered.<br/><br/>The limitations: <br/><br/>You need a big sting on Friday to get them back Monday.<br/>You need to explain everything in your plot at least once a week, preferably early in the week to pick up those new viewers who are just starting (or re-starting after a break.)<br/>There must NEVER be a situation in which every single plot is resolved. There must always be some plot that is still being worked out.<br/>There must NEVER be a situation in which every single character is changed. There must always be a character, or preferably a set of characters, who are not changing just at the moment.<br/>You have five programs a week (some are an hour, some are 2, some are 1.5 depending on the show).<br/><br/>Within these constraints, patterns begin to emerge:<br/><br/>PLOTWISE<br/><br/>On Monday, plot A from last week has a BIG DENOUEMENT, oh, it is so dramatic.  Plot B from last week is reinforced but not escalated. Plot C is presaged.<br/>On Tuesday, plot A is wrapped, plot B from last week escalates towards a climax, and plot C is introduced formally.<br/>On Wednesday, plot B EXPLOOOODES, plot C is escalated and pressure just begins to build. Plot A is introduced.<br/>On Thursday, PLOT B is wrapped. Plot C is escalated to a fever pitch, plot A is also escalated.<br/>On Friday, plot C EXPLOOOOOODES, plot A is ramped up to a fever pitch, Plot B is introduced.<br/><br/>Basically about halfway through your trip through a plot, you introduce something new.<br/><br/>Character arcs look very similar, with the added element that you usually have a gigantic cast and several of them must remain static at any one time. Typically these cycles are longer than plot cycles.  One month, Jack and Jill will be static while Ron and Nancy are the characters who change, another month, Ron and Jill will be static while Jack and Nancy change, and so forth.<br/><br/>Note that some of these tactics are absolutely wrong for episodic material - the plot escalation in particular. If everyone's ramping up to scream at each other about who killed Biff, you absolutely shouldn't turn now to someone getting into a totally unrelated car accident.<br/><br/>But for ongoing campaigns really nothing beats a soap opera.  Various nations' soap operas have different sorts of appeal, but the American soap opera is an extremely smooth-running machine.  (Mexican soap operas, my favorites, break down more often but also are nine thousand percent crazier.) There's a reason that they can obtain and keep audiences literally for decades.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179141/#Comment_179141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:21:49+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks!<br/><br/>So, how did/do you use these tactics in an RPG campaign?

Also, commercial breaks play a critical role in timing.  Plots explode right before you cut to a commercial.  And the last scene of any given episode *appears* to introduce a new plot or complication, but that may very well be dropped in favor of something more interesting by the next episode.  Like, sometimes it's a crazy shocker ending (Stoner Boy is sleeping with Goth Girl's Mom!  Oh crap, That Dead Guy is actually on the rescue boat!) that's not really enough to be the A Plot of an entire episode, at least not without slowly developing it further.<br/><br/>(Yes, I said Lost was a soap. Replace any given happening with something mundane, instead of weird island castaway jazz, and you see it immediately.  It's true of most long-running ensemble shows.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179163/#Comment_179163" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:00:35+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:00PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post!

I've used these tactics on and off for some time. The most significant use of them recently was in a Vampire game in which there were "missions" of the supernatural-procedural kind, but because the characters were independent operators, I had people coming to them with problems before they were able to fully resolve the issues of the previous person who came to them with problems. Obviously the structure doesn't tell you anything about what each plot arc should look like - it will be very different for a "troubleshooters" game vs. an exploration game.<br/><br/>Johnathan has some great observations about when inside each particular episode things occur - I never adapted that to gaming because our gaming sessions are set by people's schedules far more than by in-fiction events, but if you can count on a 3 hour session, then by all means!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179184/#Comment_179184" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:45:33+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:45PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Another interesting structural thing about soap operas is how they'll have a "set of the month" sort of thing, where almost everyone ends up in the hospital set, or the prison set, or whatnot, for various reasons.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179192/#Comment_179192" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T13:27:02+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  1:27PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone can show up on the "dungeon" set, the "abandoned temple" set, or the "king's court" set just as easily.

I myself don't know crap about wrestling; but he's been all hyper happy about it for a few months now, so I guess it's something pretty cool.  <i>Anyhow</i>, since you brought this up, I decided to hear what had to say on the subject.  I don't know if there's anything here to make your eyelashes flutter, but I figured a tangential perspective could be enlightening.\n<blockquote><cite>Burr's completely awesome friend on another forum</cite>This type of formula is no longer viable in the WWE for a couple of reasons. We'll get to singular promotions like TNA in a minute but the big boys come first. The WWE (formerly the WWF) used to be able to follow a pattern like this since they had basically had 3 nationally televised shows: RAW, SMACKDOWN, and HEAT. All the talent appeared on all the shows which allowed for a story to buildfaster. In the current configuration, WWE has 3 different barnds, each with one show per week. Each plot line is hit really hard each week for four weeks and concluded at the PPV. Unfortunately there is no other way for them to do it. Also, the WWE is pushing more talent than ever before. This is why they went to the seperate brands in the first place. It's hard to have twenty or more legitimate superstars who can all carry a story and get them all the face time they deserve. I discussed this exact thing with Matt Hardy a while back and though he is enjoying a huge push, he knows he has to bust his ass to keep it. It's just too hard, with that much talent to be pushed, to work an angle as thoroughly as they used to. I still think that many story lines are done very well.<br/><br/>As far as TNA goes, they have the capacity to work angles more extensively. They need to get a secondary show, even if it's an hour long. They need some fresh writers. They some guys who can carry an angle and do it well.<br/><br/>Now, I can speak for independent wrestling (to be called Indy Wrestling from here on out) more specifically because I am an Indy promoter. I am 50% owner of Asylum Championship Wrestling (widely considered one of the best Indy promotions in the country.) We look at story lines a lot more extensively than most indy promotions. Most just book a bunch of matches and have guys go out and work. No distinguishing between face and heel. I hate that. We run shows once a month and we really tell our stories well. Our fans come back month after month to see what will happen next. We don't have the luxury of weekly or twice-a-week shows to tell the stories in some preset pattern or formula. To be honest, not following the soap-opera pattern has really allowed for some creativity that may have given way to ho-hum otherwise. Indy wrestling isn't bogged down with writers (when they exsist at all) trying to make sure Plaots A,B, and C are all worked in within their set boundries and whatnot.<br/><br/>While the soap-opera pattern described above works for soap-operas and has worked for wrestling, it's not the be all end all. The decline in wrestling viewership is not from lack of storytelling; the stories are still there, if accelerated some due to format. The popularization of MMA is the biggest culprit. This is only something you would realize if you are inside the business. Here's a little homework. Ask some random people who are likely to enjoy this sort of thing if they like pro wrestling. You will get several who's answer will be, "I like MMA" or, "I like the real stuff" or something similar. A very large percentage, in fact. These are people who would once have been wrestling fans. They seem to think you can like one or the other and, of course, MMA is superior because it's not scripted. I'm telling you, ask. You'll see what I mean. It's silly, of course, to say you can't like both but that's the mentality.<br/><br/>So what am I saying in all that? Simple. A story can still be pulled off successfully in wrestling without following a formula. The job of a good wrestling promotion is to suspend a viewer's disbelief. Once that is accomplished, the story telling is easy no matter the formula. If WWE and TNA aren't doing it for you, I know a great indy promotion in Colorado Springs that will.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179253/#Comment_179253" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T20:47:16+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  8:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>A couple other stealables came to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Extensive and deep re-incorporation.
