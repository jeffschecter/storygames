It was a fantastic experience - we all had a great appreciation for characterization and plot, so we really fleshed out the setting. Since then, however, my gaming group has scattered across the country, and I am left without a table to play at...<br/><br/>...alas...<br/><br/>I have dozens of settings, stories, systems, etc. cooking in my mind, but sadly, I am dreadfully inept at meeting people, so I can't really do anything my ideas. To quote the inimitable Morrissey:<br/><br/>"Shyness is nice, and shyness can stop you<br/>From doing all the things in life you'd like to"<br/><br/>What is everyone's experience drawing people together for story games or other experimental storytelling adventures for the first time? It is difficult for me to meet people as is, and I just can't seem to find anyone who really wants to join in!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>~Klaus<br/><br/>P.S. I've painfully tried approaching people and to suggest storytelling games, but where I live, folks seem to be locked into crunchy/tactical things like Shadowrun (not my cup of tea).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431274/#Comment_431274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T05:53:42+00:00" title="April 19, 2014  5:53AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2014 5:55AM by w176.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go about like this:<br/><br/>I would invite friends over board game night, to just hang out, drink beer/tea/coffee/wine/hot chocolate/whatever and play some board games.

Because you never know who among your facebook friends are a gamer or want to be gamer and would love the opportunity to play some games. I would tell my friends to bring their cool board games, if they have any. Among my board games I would sneak in some easy fun story games, like Fiasco or roleplay like games like The Resistance. Just in case someone want to try.<br/><br/>During the board game night there is an excellent opportunity ask if anyone want to perhaps try put some roleplaying games/story games some other evening or join a gaming group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431277/#Comment_431277" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T07:39:48+00:00" title="April 19, 2014  7:39AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2014 2:17AM by Rafu.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few random thoughts, some phrased as questions:<br/><br/>\u2014 Shy or not, which social venues/situations are you most comfortable with? The more people you meet, the more likely it is to meet someone who'll be interested in playing; the more time you spend with people, the more comfortable you're going to be pitching games to them. Thus, try to maximize whatever social experiences you already do enjoy (which has lot of potential benefits, not all of them related to games).<br/><br/>\u2014 Of the games you'd most like to play, which ones have the lightest social footprint? Make a few lists of games based on play time, ease of explaining the rules, etc. To approach first-timers, ideally, you want something which can be played to an ending in &lt;1 hour, all explanations and prep included. 1 hour maximum from "let's play" to "so, how did you enjoy it?". If they did enjoy it, they'll be back for more.<br/><br/><br/>\u2014 Which people do you already spend time with, whom it never occurred you to play games with? I'm thinking family, relatives, co-workers, friends of friends, habitual commuters on the same bus/train carriage\u2026 Just anybody you're used to talking with, who's therefore not gonna be creeped out by you asking they spend some more time talking with you.<br/><br/>\u2014 What do people like? For people you've met in the gaming community, try to learn what they like outside of the obvious game-stuff or geeky things: that may give you ideas for pitching them games. For people you've met outside gamer circles, it's just a general "what do you like?" question, but you may narrow it down to "what kind of stories do you like?", or "what are your favorite movies/fiction books?".<br/><br/>\u2014 Find out how to phrase it depending on whom you're pitching "role-playing games" to. It doesn't really matter that &lt;i&gt;you think of them as "role-playing games". Gamers may react better to you calling them "a different kind of role-playing games", or to you making up some new word they've never heard before, or to you leaving out the word "games" altogether. Non-gamers might be attracted to the idea these are a form of "play", might be curious about "role-playing games" because they've heard vague things about them, or might be more interested if you leave out any mention of "games", depending on what they like, what their general outlook is, etc. Do experiment with words!<br/><br/>\u2014 Don't be shy about pitching your own creations. If you've devised even a minor, tiny hack to a published game, pitching it as <i>your</i> game may get you more people willing to try it than if you were just raving fanboyishly about some indie game-designer they've never heard about. For most people, I think, that it's <i>your</i> game sort of explains why it matters to you.<br/><br/>Also, don't give up trying. Most of the people you play a short one-shot game with <i>won't</i> be coming back for more, for a wide range of reasons. But some eventually will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431278/#Comment_431278" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T10:05:23+00:00" title="April 19, 2014 10:05AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you've met some people in the local community and they're cool with Shadowrun. Often times when someone is invited to a game, if they're in a game like Shadowrun, they assume the game they're being invited to has a similar social footprint to what they have, which may be: "We will get together weekly and play for the next 5 years."  To make such a commitment they have to really, really know they love the game they're gonna play for that length of time.<br/><br/>Try it this way: "I want to try out this game and I've heard you're a really good player. I think it will be fun and I think you'll be awesome. It's gonna be on the 16th and maybe if we run over time we'll get together on the 23rd to finish up."  And then play a few chapters of In A Wicked Age or a few episodes of Primetime Adventures and see how it goes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431279/#Comment_431279" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T10:18:09+00:00" title="April 19, 2014 10:18AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 11:04AM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>.  When I started up my current gaming group, I contacted some smart friends in the local activist community (most of them had little or no experience in RPGs).  I pitched them on the idea of playing the game (Apocalypse World), and I asked them to invite a few others whom they thought would enjoy it.  I didn't want to scare anyone away with any massive commitments so I made it clear that this would be a <i>limited</i> game, <b>just three sessions</b> in length.  That way it's not too much for any newbie to consider working into their schedule.  If the group doesn't really work out, all you've lost is three sessions.  But if those sessions go well, your new players will ask to continue beyond session 3, if so, congratulations, you've got a regular gaming group.<br/><br/>The AW campaign of course requires repeat attendance and can get pretty heavy.  So I scheduled this campaign to run every <i>other</i> week.  On the weeks in between, we do <b>Random Game Nights</b> where we play anything from RISK to Cards Against Humanity to Doctor Magnethands.  One-shots.  Anyone can bring any friends they want on those nights.  They can even bring games from home and we'll play them.  These Random Game Nights involve a lot more alcohol and silliness; they lighten the mood, and provide a "recruiting pool" to meet new players for other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431338/#Comment_431338" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T11:22:48+00:00" title="April 20, 2014 11:22AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try playing online (Skype or Google Hangouts).

It is related to this, but I'm not assuming that this is what is happening in Aslf case.<br/><br/>Sometimes you have a community of gamers and creators in the gaming hobby that have a strong culture of reciprocity. People help out with each others gaming projects. It might be game designer giving each other feedback, larp organizers helping each other out or a group of gamers coming together to play different games, sometimes playing A favorite games and sometimes play B C or D favorite games. Every now and then someone new joins the community. As long as they join the culture of mutual reciprocity  and support everything is fine. <br/><br/>But every now and then someone new shows up, because they see that there all this nice support to be had and ant it. But they show up with this attitude:<br/><br/><b><i>"Hey! I want you all to support my game project. Because my gameing project is so awesome But I have no inclination what so ever to support your gaming projects. I just want your support to my awesome project!"</i></b><br/><br/>Often that person don't get any support, because they show no sign of getting the culture of reciprocity.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that sometimes when you want other people to support you gaming project you have to show that you are willing to support them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431410/#Comment_431410" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T17:16:38+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  5:16PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>"Hey!

Many communities are on the lookout for exploiters who might try to join them just to suck them dry, or to change them into something they're not, etc. Additionally, any <i>on-line</i> community actually have some kind of in-the-flesh "core" (the original, founding group of friends, or the yearly meetup, or whatever), and it's only newbies who come to it on-line who perceive them as being purely on-line communities\u2014which might make such newbies less than welcome. More generally, newcomers, by definition don't know the local rules and customs.<br/>All of the above means: the newcomer might say the wrong thing, and trigger a defensive reaction!<br/>Often, a community might believe a new user is just there to ask for support without giving anything back, but actually their perception is wrong. The newcomer is being misunderstood because they don't yet speak the local idiom. And this might get awful for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431420/#Comment_431420" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T20:13:13+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  8:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is a good lesson there about learning from existing communities.

On the other hand trying OSR with the group is a much harder sell, given that the bulk of the group doesn't care much for tactical play or random events. <br/><br/>Which is a long way of saying that "Jill likes D&amp;D" is a much less useful datum than "Jill likes D&amp;D because she enjoys tactical combat and leveling feedback" if you're trying to find a game that both you and Jill can play together.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431523/#Comment_431523" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-23T14:15:35+00:00" title="April 23, 2014  2:15PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 11:05AM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When reaching out to people who <i>aren't</i> already gamers, it helps to choose a game that ties in with their other interests (preferably interests you share in common with them).<br/><br/>For example, it was not very hard to convince my activist friends to play <i>Apocalypse World</i> - a game that forces us to imagine what the world might become if <i>the exact scenario we spend a lot of our time thinking about as activists</i> comes to pass.  It would have been MUCH HARDER to convince them to play something like <i>Dungeon World</i>, or <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, or any of the other games I might have started with.  But now that we're gaming on a weekly basis, those other games have become possible to pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
