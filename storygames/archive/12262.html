If you feel like the genre deserves some more screw-ups and complicated situations, give it a try.<br/><br/>Everything about the game remains as written; only the resolution rules are modified slightly.<br/><br/>1. When an obstacle comes up, the GM no longer decides on its difficulty. Instead, she decides how complicated the situation is. It is either Simple, Challenging, Complex, or A Fiasco. This determines how many dangers apply to the action.<br/><br/>Simple: No Dangers<br/>Challenging: One Danger<br/>Complicated: Two Dangers<br/>A Fiasco: Three Dangers<br/><br/>You probably shouldn't roll at all for Simple obstacles, but if you need to for some reason, you can. Most tasks are either Challenging or Complicated. If you can't think of enough Dangers, or you think of more than the number you originally thought, that's fine: it's more or less complicated, as follows.<br/><br/>Conditions play into determining how complicated something is, of course.<br/><br/>2. The acting player names their goal--what they're trying to achieve--the GM and other players name the Dangers. <br/><br/>3. You roll the dice. Each "6" is a hit. You can spend your hits as follows:<br/><br/>* Spend a hit to achieve your goal.<br/>* Spend a hit to avoid a Danger.<br/>* Spend a hit to establish an Advantage. (See below.)<br/><br/>4. If you didn't roll as many 6's as you would have liked, you can flip your results: ignore those "6's"--now all your "1's" are hits instead. If you choose to use your "1's" as hits, you will suffer a Condition, however!<br/><br/>5. An Advantage is a one-time Tag, something that results from an action. You can use an Advantage to roll an extra die--but then the Advantage is erased. If you spend multiple hits, you can create an Advantage that's worth multiple dice.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So, for example, say you're attempting a Challenging task: you're trying to ram through the hold's doors with the Owl, escaping from the Hand or Sorrow. The Danger is that Naomi, who's holding on to the back of the Owl, flies off into space. <br/><br/>You roll your dice, and you end up with one "6" and three "1's".<br/><br/>You could accept the one hit (from the single "6"), and use it to escape, but lose Naomi.<br/><br/>Or you can use your "1's" as hits, escaping from the Hand (1) with Naomi (2), and using your third hit to establish an Advantage (it's flying like a bullet of the hold!). But the Owl is now Busted &amp; Leaking (a Condition). However, that Advantage will give you an extra die if there is pursuit from the Hand.<br/><br/>That's it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274840/#Comment_274840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T08:50:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  8:50AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few notes:<br/><br/>First, the Advantages thing is optional.

I'm not sure what you mean by your question, however, being unfamiliar with "Danger Rolls" (and I can't find anything on it online, at least not so far--ah, never mind, it's on Levi's page!).<br/><br/>Danger Rolls are still basically Otherkind dice. Whether you name the Goal is one element you need to spend a success/high die on, or name failing the goal as a Danger, it comes down to more or less the same thing (which isn't to say it's not an interesting design decision: it comes down to deciding whether you're determining the stakes of failure or the stakes of success).<br/><br/>You could do this as Danger Rolls, too: naming failure in the task/obstacle as a Danger. Just increase the number of dangers for each category by one if you do so; the mechanics work exactly the same way, no problem. I prefer to let the player name their goal, however, just as a way of getting more player input (there's less room for that whole "succeed in what you're trying to do, but fail to get what you want" kind of frustration).<br/><br/>Really the only design challenge I've tackled here is working out how to get Danger Rolls/Otherkind dice to work without changing the number of dice rolled in a game of Lady Blackbird, after all! But that's something, I think, nevertheless. It took me a while to find a simple and elegant solution that still gave the right odds of success/complication (with this kind of design, you want one good result to be almost guaranteed, but at the same time to keep the odds of many good results as low as possible, which isn't always an obvious thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274859/#Comment_274859" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T10:52:02+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 10:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!<br/><br/>Probably time to get some playtesting in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274860/#Comment_274860" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T11:07:21+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 11:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I may have a chance to run this version of Lady Blackbird in just a couple of weeks!

Obstacles are things that would prevent you from accomplishing your endeavor. For instance, you're endeavoring to fight off armed assassins who have just attacked in your sleep:<br/><br/>Obstacle: you're outnumbered.<br/>Obstacle: you're unarmed.<br/>Obstacle: you're surprised.<br/>So this endeavor has 3 Obstacles.<br/><br/>Dangers are unpleasant things that might happen whether you succeed or fail in your endeavor. To continue the previous example, there's certainly the Danger that you'll be injured.<br/><br/>What you do is you roll your appropriate dice pools looking for hits. A 4 or higher is a hit, as in BW. Then you "spend" hits to "address" Obstacles and Dangers. If you do not address all the Obstacles, then your endeavor fails (thus the number of Obstacles is the same thing as the Obstacle number in BW). If you do not address a Danger, then it comes to pass. And, of course, you narrate how you address all those things.<br/><br/>So, in essence, it's the same as Otherkind in that you have to balance a limited resource between success in your endeavor and avoiding unpleasant tangential outcomes.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this is the whole Obstacle idea. It solves the problem for me, as GM, in arbitrarily setting difficulties. This way, I've got concrete principles to judge from.<br/><br/>(Mine's also got advantages and tags and stuff, but they let you reroll misses or explode sixes instead of just adding extra dice)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274899/#Comment_274899" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T15:54:07+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  3:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Is that distinction meaningful? Probably not, so the real point is:<br/><br/>In original Otherkind Dice (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow">link for those who need it</a>), the results for Goal and Danger are different numbers, with Dangers having 1-3 comes true and 4-6 does not come true. So having Goal be distinct from Dangers is important, and gives you something to think about when you roll 3s and 4s.<br/><br/>In both <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">Ghost/Echo</a> and <a href="http://www.amagi-games.org/danger-rolls" rel="nofollow">Danger Rolls</a>, the numbers are the same for both. Having a separate category for achieving your Goal in G/E means that failure is always a danger on the table. In Danger Rolls, the player still states his Goal, but when the GM states Dangers, those may or may not stop the character from achieving that Goal. If a Danger comes true that stops the character from achieving the Goal, he doesn't achieve the Goal. But if none of the stated Dangers would stop the character from achieving that Goal, then there is no chance of failure, and it becomes a question of how much it costs. Or, two different Dangers could stop the character from achieving the player's Goal, where it's always just the one in G/E. Do you see the distinction? It makes things more flexible for the GM. Having the die results similar for Goal and Dangers is the only thing I dislike about G/E, though I still play it the way it's written.<br/><br/>I've fooled around with the OD/DR+BW thing in my own game designs, too. I really like the idea that each "success" provides a concrete result, instead of counting up successes to determine a result. Much like how an investigation roll in Storming the Wizard's Tower works -- each success gives you one clue or piece of information. So each success on an action roll lets you avoid one danger, and if you avoid them all, you do what you set out to do, exactly, and you don't have to worry about adding them up. The system I wrote was closer to Marshall's than your LB hack, but LB gives you more dice to roll than BW does, and the option to use 1s with a Condition is pretty ingenious.<br/><br/>edit: oh heck, more linkage, why not                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274906/#Comment_274906" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T17:16:21+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  5:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>Those are good points. I also prefer having a differentiation between goal success and danger results, but I couldn't figure out how to achieve that given the piles of dice you roll in Lady Blackbird. (As you mention, also, that distinction isn't used in Ghost/Echo.) On top of that, I needed a way to get Conditions in there, and I finally hit on that with the 1s, solving both design problems at once. It was really hard to get the right spread of odds with a pool of d6s that can range from just a few (like two or three) to piles (like a dozen or more), always retaining a good chance of success and never making it likely that you hit more than a couple of hits in a single roll.<br/><br/>I also figured that leaving the actual chances of success the same (i.e. up to the players) seemed like a good fit for the 'heroic' sense of the Lady Blackbird setup.<br/><br/>I hadn't read Danger Rolls before setting this up, but now I wonder why you consider it so distinct from Otherkind dice. It seems like a very minor variation. Is there some evidence that it came first--i.e. wasn't influenced by Otherkind dice?<br/><br/>The question of whether the character's goal is on the line is a fruitful one, but, as I mentioned, each approach has its drawbacks. One side of the equation remains undefined, and either way it can be a challenge in play. <br/><br/>However, your point about how several Dangers can threaten the Goal, thus combining the difficulty settings of Burning Wheel and an Otherkind-type mechanic... that's really cool. I don't think it's necessary for Lady Blackbird, which is more about success + complications than unsurmountable difficulties, but it sure does open things up quite a bit, and could work well in this kind of implementation (where it's possible to roll "extra" successes, thus opening up the range of challenge you can build into the system).

For example, if you had said to me: "Lady Blackbird with Danger Rolls, 1-3 Dangers, use your 1s if you take a Condition" I wouldn't need to read your OP because I would understand it already. All of it (except maybe Goal as distinct from Dangers, and whether you can use 1s OR 6s, or 1s AND 6s). Because that's more <i>accurate</i> than LB+OD. Anyway, not really important. Although, considering how few moving parts there are in each system, any distinction is going to be pretty major, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>The question of whether the character's goal is on the line is a fruitful one, but, as I mentioned, each approach has its drawbacks. One side of the equation remains undefined, and either way it can be a challenge in play.</blockquote>\nHaving Goal be distinct is easier for a player to understand. Having Dangers be unconstrained is easier for a GM to use. But when the die results are the same, I don't see any advantage to having a distinct Goal. I can see the advantage to the GM stating failure-as-danger in the form of achieving your Goal, but not the advantage to having it hard-coded in the game. Dunno, that's just me, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274910/#Comment_274910" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T18:13:51+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  6:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa! I was actually just thinking about this exact same thing last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the Otherkind dice mechanic. I think that it is really liberating for the GM. It grounds conditions of success/failure in the narrative, and also creates very obvious gradations of sucess, with the player in control of how he wants the action to pan out. Less number crunching and more story. I also like the way the pool mechanic in LB works, and the almost Fate3e-Aspect-like traits and tags. Add it all up and it seems like you could get a cool system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about how you could add in more elements of Fate 3e like a maneuver type mechanic. This hack seems to have done that with the addition of Advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I was thinking about was making LB require less GM-player back and forth. I play PbP more than FtF, so the less back and forth the better, as it keeps the action rolling. Stagnation kills PbP, and back and forth creates stagnation. Otherkind dice can limit back and forth some if you leave it up to the players to come up with their own dangers, and as long as players are cool about creating good dangers. Seems like a bunch of mature players could take this hack, let the players decide on their own level of complication based on the current narrative, and really fly through a PbP narrative. If there was a mechanic of penalizing a player for creating lame dangers or not enough dangers, or if there were a reward system for encouraging players to complicate their own actions, seems like you could keep the action going without needing to ever wait for someone else to post before you finish up an action.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nice hack. I will think more about this, and probably hack your hack of John's hack. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274925/#Comment_274925" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T22:00:43+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 10:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2010 10:01PM by Nameless.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a thought.

People generally want what they're rolling for, you know? Besides, Advantages really aren't all that powerful in this version. But if it becomes a problem, then Sanglorian's solution works just fine. My solution would probably be to say: you can't spend for Advantage unless you win your Goal. (Because if you're losing, what's your Advantage, you know? But there may be situations where it makes sense to do the opposite, and then why not go for it?)<br/><br/>It is a reason not to use the Danger Rolls approach to resolution, though.<br/><br/>Here's a "real" example: see my example roll, up top? As a player, how would you "take advantage" of this problem in that situation? Those three hits (the 1s) are a pretty lucky roll to begin with, but is spending one of them to keep Naomi with the ship, and then spending the other two on Advantages worth being trapped in the hold AND taking a Condition, just to get another Pool die? <br/><br/>And, if so, what would your Advantage be? I could see passing them over to Naomi, I suppose, but that's about it, and that would be a cool outcome, I think. I don't really see this as an issue, personally.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the scaling of Dangers gives a really easy way to do escalation for the GM: the next roll in the same scene has an additional Danger attached to it. You can hint at what it is as soon as someone fails, but the extra Danger is a handy reminder. So, in this case, escalation might be that the soldiers/guards/stormtroopers rush into the hold. You can bet if there's more rolling one of the Dangers will be that they capture or shoot someone.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274963/#Comment_274963" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T07:28:32+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  7:28AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>I follow! I just wasn't aware of Danger Rolls when I wrote this up. But I still see Ghost/Echo and Danger Rolls as slight variations on the basic Otherkind dice concept, so I think credit should go to where it's due. I'm not sure my hack is less like Otherkind than it is like Danger Rolls--after all, it does need a Goal, for the Pool to work, among other things.<br/><br/>As for having a distinct Goal, it's something I've given a fair amount of thought to, and I can share my conclusions, but before I do that, can you give me an example of how you use multiple Dangers as obstacles to a Goal? I like the idea, but I'm having trouble imagining using it in play. Marshall's version just names them as "Obstacles", but they're not Dangers that need to be avoided. I like the idea that you could combine the two, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to use that.<br/><br/>Thanks for the good discussion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274976/#Comment_274976" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T08:31:58+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  8:31AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, here's a bunch of examples:<br/><br/>1.<br/>Okay, Joe is playing Razor. He sees his enemy Brodie look out around a corner. Razor goes around the corner and shoots him. It's early morning and Brodie has just opened up his illegal chop-shop's garage doors.<br/><br/>Joe's goal is to kill Brodie, and Razor's action is to shoot Brodie. GM says the dangers are: "You fail to kill Brodie. You cause unintended damage. Brodie unloads on you and you get shot in the leg, around the knee area."<br/><br/>Joe rolls his dice and gets two successes, so he can avoid two dangers. He chooses to cause unintended harm. So he kills Brodie, and doesn't get shot himself, but he hits a propane tank, it explodes, and the garage is engulfed in flames. Razor books it.<br/><br/>In this instance, it might be better to have the possible results for the Goal (kill Brodie) include partial success, just like in OD or G/E. I don't really see how having a result of "the danger partially comes true and remains" would add to this example.<br/><br/>2.<br/>Razor is on the roof of a building, being pursued by zombies. His player says he will jump across a narrow alley to the next building, in order to escape. The GM chooses dangers: "Dangers are: You fall. You don't escape."<br/>Joe gets one success. He can choose to jump and fall, thus escaping the zombies, or he can not fall and not escape the zombies. What does that mean? Perhaps Razor falls short of the other building, but falls through a window. The zombies can't get into this building, however.<br/><br/>Back up. How about instead the GM says: "Dangers are: You lose something. You suffer harm. You wind up in a bad position." Let's say Joe gets three successes, and so he avoids all dangers. The GM can't veto his narration without a danger coming true, so he can describe his character escaping. But what if these dangers come true?<br/>"You lose something." Either the GM or the player picks something. Maybe he drops his backpack, maybe he loses consciousness. He probably escapes.<br/>"You suffer harm." Maybe he twists an ankle on the jump over. Or maybe he falls to the street below. If he's too hurt to get up, he probably hasn't escaped the zombies.<br/>"You wind up in a bad position." If that bad position is him on the roof surrounded by zombies, then he obviously hasn't escaped. If he jumps through a window and finds himself surrounded by gun-toting thieves, he's probably escaped the zombies.<br/><br/>In this example, the player describes his character's actions, and the GM interjects with the dangers that come true. The GM can describe the dangers in great detail, or vaguely, whatever. They'll be detailed when you actually introduce them.<br/><br/>How about a third version? Razor jumped, now it's my turn. Dangers are: "You fall short and hit a balcony. You fall short and hit the ground. You don't jump." Hey, that's pretty strange, isn't it? What happens if I roll no successes? I don't jump, but instead I trip over the edge, hit a balcony on the building I started on, then fall off that and hit the ground. If I only get one success, I could still jump and hit both, but probably I want to trip and fall onto a balcony. If I get two successes, only one danger comes true. So maybe I'm just standing there at the edge, having realized the jump is too far. Shit, now what? Or I could jump to a balcony across the alley. That might be a better option. If I get three successes, I just narrate my character doing exactly what I want him to do.<br/><br/>3.<br/>And then one of us falls. Dangers are: "You die. You're crippled. You're unconscious." Damn, that's rough. Obviously the first success will go to avoid dying. No point in avoiding being crippled if I'm dead, right? If I get two successes, I've got to choose between being crippled and unconscious. If the zombies are still coming, I may not want to be unconscious. That's an example of staggered dangers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274999/#Comment_274999" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T12:28:19+00:00" title="June  8, 2010 12:28PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>Great examples!<br/><br/>In the first one, though, it's just straight-up, isn't it?

It's hard to decide how to determine "success" versus failure. A minimum numbers of hits rolled is a good solution, I suppose: if you rolled at least one hit, or if you rolled at least two hits, you give up your Pool dice. Would have to playtest this one.<br/><br/>2. Issues of GM control and player agency. My feeling is that the default I've outlined, which includes a player goal is more "heroic" in feel: as long as you can name a reasonable goal for your character, you have pretty good odds of achieving it. It's just a question of how much you'll suffer or how much trouble you'll cause along the way. I like this for a game like Lady Blackbird; the Danger Rolls variant gives the GM a lot more leeway to make things harder on the players, but I'm not sure that's necessary for this game. I find that allowing the players to set their own Goals gives them more input into the game, allowing them to push the story along at the pace they prefer (you can see from goals which are named: is it "break the code on the prison door" or "escape with the Lady"?). <br/><br/>Johnstone, I get the impression that your approach is best seen as "after the resolution is made, the player narrates success as much as they can, while taking the GM's Dangers into account" (or the GM interjects them into the narrative). This is a cool way to do things. However, it puts the onus on some very active player narration/initiative. For more "traditional" group dynamics, it may be easier for a group to settle into the "player names goal, GM narrates" model. But I'm just hypothesizing--it just seems like the way you're using the Danger Rolls mechanic puts the player into a hard corner much more often. What do you think? My gut instinct is that having the player name the goal is more fitting for a heroic game like Lady Blackbird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275137/#Comment_275137" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T09:09:23+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  9:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GMing this Hack</b><br/><br/>To run Lady Blackbird using this hack of the rules, here are some guidelines:<br/><br/>1. Most of the time (and especially at the beginning of the game, or, later, at the beginning of a new situation), make actions Challenging: name a Danger, and roll the dice. <br/>2. However, upon failure, escalate the situation: the complexity of subsequent attempts will involve a new danger.<br/><br/>For instance, in the case of the Owl trying to escape from the brig, a failure might bring a whole bunch of stormtroopers/guards down on the heads of the party. That means the next roll will have an extra danger, reflecting the actions of the guards.<br/><br/>As situations escalate, they become more complex, and more dangers are brought to bear upon the heroes.<br/><br/>3. Tremendous Challenge: Optional<br/><br/>Sometimes, the players will attempt goals that are reasonable but tremendously difficult or unlikely--they'll overreach themselves. When this happens, the GM has another tool at her disposal: the Obstacle.<br/><br/>The Obstacle is just a special type of Danger: unless it is avoided/circumvented, the goal cannot be reached. Obstacles are added in on top of the regular dangers present.<br/><br/>Throw in one Obstacle for really hard stuff, two Obstacles for something that's practically impossible. In a really unlikely situation, you could have three Obstacles.<br/><br/>Use Obstacles very sparingly--maybe just once a session or so, as seems fitting.<br/><br/>That's how I would do it, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275230/#Comment_275230" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T16:05:41+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  4:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is perfect.

This is a cool way to do things. However, it puts the onus on some very active player narration/initiative. For more "traditional" group dynamics, it may be easier for a group to settle into the "player names goal, GM narrates" model. But I'm just hypothesizing--it just seems like the way you're using the Danger Rolls mechanic puts the player into a hard corner much more often. What do you think? My gut instinct is that having the player name the goal is more fitting for a heroic game like Lady Blackbird.</blockquote>\nYes, that's quite possible. I think it might also be better for new players to name their Goal. And honestly, I fucking abhor the "GM as storyteller" model, where the player says what his character attempts to do, and the GM narrates what the character actually does. What happens to the character (including failing and falling short) is fair game for the GM, I feel, but anything that the character or the player intends to do should be narrated in full by the player. Basically, that's my preference, with some room for various systems to move that around a bit.<br/><br/>So, in my approach, players don't really need to name a goal, because they are always narrating their characters without reference to dice until the GM introduces the threat of danger. They roll dice, and either they overcome those dangers, or the GM uses them to interfere in their narration, above and beyond the line that divides PC from setting. The player can narrate any sort of success he wants, unless the danger prevents him. This also solves the problem of knowing when to roll, because you only roll when the GM threatens you with danger.<br/><br/>Caveat: this only works for actions. Stuff like collecting information ("read a person"), or building things, or introducing setting elements (wises rolls, circles tests, resources tests from BW) will all probably need to be handled slightly differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275262/#Comment_275262" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T19:49:16+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  7:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that combination of Dangers and Obstacles, and also the advice on increasing the difficulty over the course of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275264/#Comment_275264" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T20:00:19+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  8:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me, Johnstone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277445/#Comment_277445" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T07:14:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  7:14AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I'm going to run this in a few weeks.<br/><br/>Here's another thing that looks like a rules modification (to my hack, above), but really isn't:<br/><br/>* Spend a hit to establish a fact about what just happened.

Good fun was had by all, despite a starting run of bad luck (I set up a scenario a little different from what's in the Lady Blackbird text, with initial rolls that establish just how bad the situation is for the characters).<br/><br/>The only hitch was the handling time:<br/><br/>I'd underestimated how long it can take a player to pick a Trait and then figure out how many Tags apply. Adding the goal and dangers onto that slowed it further (although was generally more obvious than choosing Tags for us). Nevertheless, it was worth the trouble, and a lot of fun--we speeded up as we went along.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this hack, although using it made me realize in another way why the original game has a simpler basic mechanic. Still, the Otherkind goodness and trouble (especially the accumulating Conditions on the characters) was extremely fitting for the genre and gave rise to some great plot twists (like one of the characters leaping madly into the maw of a sky squid, sacrificing his life to save the Owl).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282010/#Comment_282010" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T23:18:15+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:18PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I love the Obstacles that Marshall brought up.

My examples are from a rough draft I was working on a while back, and they're divorced from the rest of the game, which breaks down what players and GM have responsibility for a little differently than most games.<br/><br/>Sounds like you're concerned about how vague the dangers are, though, yeah? When I wrote vague I meant like "you get shot" as a danger, not "something bad happens," as opposed to being really detailed, like "the danger is you take a bullet in the upper thigh, fall down, and are bleeding severely." I was imagining it would be fairly obvious what the consequences of most dangers would be, and that the player could ask for more information from the GM before choosing. And for dangers like "you see into another dimension for a second," the GM wouldn't describe anything more until that danger came true.<br/><br/>I wanted the caveat for vague detail because the problem I find with Otherkind Dice is that you, as GM, think up all these interesting failure options, and then the player rolls well and ignores them all, or just picks one and the choice between which one didn't turn out to be interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282040/#Comment_282040" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T05:34:28+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  5:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Obstacles concept is from Burning Wheel (and Mouse Guard).<br/><br/>As for using Dangers and what-not, I think using very specific dangers vs. very vague dangers (and likewise for character goals) is something you can easily adjust to your group's comfort level.
