The object of the "game" is to cue off the emotional sentiment of the music as it changes. The director, of course, spices things up by changing tracks suddenly and without warning. If the tone of the music is dramatic, then the players must respond accordingly, regardless of the topic. I've seen scenes as simple as a trip to the grocery store become quite compelling. "Can you get the milk?" *Cue dramatic overture* "We're out of milk? How can we be out of milk? Who's been drinking all of our milk?" da da daaaaaaa! It's very soap opera, sure, and the power of scene is probably not relayed in my 2:30am ranting, but it's genuinely amusing to witness (and even more so to be part of).<br/><br/>This got me thinking. What if you had a rules-light RPG (such as Cosmic Patrol) that was played in real time with a full 60 or 90 minute sound track playing in the background. The soundtrack would be laid out so as to mimic the typical pacing of a movie or television show, and the players would feed off the sound track. You may be acting out a totally mundane scene aboard a starship. "Mister Conway, perform a full systems scan of that probe." When suddenly the music shifts... Maybe it becomes upbeat, giving the science officer a clue that the probe has markings of a friendly ship carrying an old comrade. Or if the music were suspenseful, hanging in the balance like a cliffhanger.... <br/><br/>Well, if my idea has any merit, then you just had at least one or two ideas for yourself. I think this would work because we've all watched enough movies and television to instinctively key in on these moments. Who among us that's at least 30 years old doesn't still cringe every time they hear the theme to jaws?<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Has this been done? Is it worth exploring?

I'll have to check out Ribbon Drive. The main difference I'm noting from your simple description is that you say that "the tone of the scenes should play off the music <i>where possible</i>". In my mind, the real benefit comes when players really focus on staying in the tone of the music, changing to match it's tone even if it doesn't seem appropriate at the time. This allows for opportunities for new ideas to slide into game play. In my mind, you actually allow the music to tell the players what is important. The scene where your gang members were scouting a heist on the loading docks could be very uneventful of none of the players think it's an important moment, but that all changes if the music picks up the pace and turns into an action or chase scene. Using a full soundtrack as a guide can help players pace a game properly. It should be exciting, introspective, and expository in measured doses. These are things that I've personally had difficulty with when playing non-moderated story-driven games over the years. When do we ratchet tension? What's really important in this scene? (taking improv classes really bolstered my ability to do this, and I highly recommend the same for anyone interested in story games). TV and movies have the pacing down a science, literally. I took some television writing classes and after I learned to dissect the 4-act structure and taught my wife how to do it too, she was disappointed to discover how formulaic it all is.<br/><br/>I mentioned Cosmic Patrol because it is, by all accounts, a long-form improv show with dice and no audience. When most people think of improv, they think of "short-form" as popularized by shows like "Who's Line is it Anyways?" In long-form improv the actors perform an entire 60 minute play in front of the audience, using only a general guideline for a setting, along with a few audience suggestions to get them started. I've seen improv shows based on Woody Allen, H.P. Lovecraft, and even Doctor Who. Cosmic Patrol replaces the audience suggestions with the mission cues, and adds dice to make it more of a "game" but it's nearly identical. I think this sort of game would work best for this soundtrack-as-mechanic because the game need not be slowed down by rules lookups. I think many games could benefit from it though. Wilderness of Mirrors is another that comes to mind. Apocalypse world would probably work well too.<br/><br/>My big problem is that I don't really have a group to test it out. I have people that will play a story game with me on occasion (usually Fiasco), but they are more tied to traditional reward-based RPG systems where they can grow their character, so we don't get to play these games enough for me to really put it to the test.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402427/#Comment_402427" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T19:41:26+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  7:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way you just described it is more or less what Ribbon Drive supposed to be - in my mind, the "if possible" is mostly just for cases when either no one can think of how to switch into that tone from the specific scene. Sometimes though in the interest of a good scene you just finish it up even after the music changes. From the game: "If the song changes mid-scene, it's important to allow the new song's tone to leak into our narration and guide the direction we take the scene. Again, we shouldn't slavishly hold to this rule, but take it as a light guide."<br/><br/>I will say that, without any experience actually playing the game yet, it seems very well suited for a specific sort of story (the road-trip story). Characters have Futures, the things they're striving for, and when a character breaks free and has abandoned both of their futures and is living in the moment they are declared the Protagonist, which is the beginning of the endgame. So the particular built-in "plot arc" of letting go on the open road (which is what the game is built to do) may not give you the general freedom you're hoping to use this mechanic for. Now, not every game has this happen, you can choose to play otherwise, but that's what the game seems to be aiming toward. So as Noah said, there's definitely space here to do something a little different. I haven't read Cosmic Patrol to comment on its ability relative to Ribbon Drive's, but from outward glances at it it's a difference of RD being about a theme and CP being about a genre. Again though, I haven't PLAYED Ribbon Drive yet.<br/>Unfortunately, Ribbon Drive is out of print and pdf right now, you'd need to find a physical copy or some such.<br/><br/>I'm curious. Are you thinking of an instrumental soundtrack (as is usually the case in tv/film scores) or lyrical? I ask because Ribbon Drive is very much lyrically-based - the premise and character drives are often pulled directly from the lyrics, and every song on the included sample mixtape (which is pretty interesting btw) has lyrics.<br/><br/>Additionally, what're you thinking for how the soundtrack is made? Each player bringing a disc (which is like Ribbon Drive, with each bringing a disc which they created with a pervasive theme, but different discs having different themes) or one person making the disc (which would give a more cohesive feel through the game, but means someone knows what the tonal run of the game will look like)? Both have their purpose.<br/>I think an interesting thing could be to have one person compile the music, but to play it on shuffle to keep things fresh.<br/><br/>Fun stuff to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402441/#Comment_402441" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T22:09:10+00:00" title="January  1, 2013 10:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lucky enough to own a copy of Ribbon Drive and have played it quite a lot, but can't comment on Cosmic Patrol.<br/><br/>On the OP note, my take was that the idea was to create a score and play through it. As such no lyrics and longer pieces of music. You could do this and still be somewhat surprised if you made a number of discs and picked one at random. With regards to Ribbon Drive because it's based on mix tapes (only the first two must have lyrics because they are used to generate facts about the game but in general they all tend to) the songs can be quite short and not of an obvious theme in a way that musical scores are. This is why you tend to phase in and out of playing to the music when playing the game. A scene can cover multiple tracks and might just not want to move that way. In practice I've found some scenes will gel perfectly with the music and when talking about the game afterwards everyone will have noticed it.<br/><br/>With regards to Ribbon Drive, advice for when you play<br/>- have some discs ready made, having to bring a disc is the biggest reason people won't play it.<br/>- it does small scale road movie drama really well so play that.<br/>- it doesn't do Action Movies, the worst games I've had have been when we've tried to make them thrilling (chase movies, gang members etc.) from the set up.<br/>- it absolutely plays best with 4 players, it can cope with 3, I wouldn't go for more or less.<br/>- everyone in the car is a PC, don't be tempted to write in a long term NPC on the trip.<br/>- I've found 4.5 hours is about the sweet spot for a game, start to finish.<br/><br/>If that sounds negative, it's my fault and shouldn't. Ribbon Drive is a fantastic game that has given me some very intense, very heartfelt games. It's strength is in the focus that you have on what you can/should talk about. With no conflict mechanic it can break if you try and bring in conflict so just avoid that and revel in the small world dramas it's great at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tofarley" title="tofarley"><img alt="tofarley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tofarley">tofarley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403280/#Comment_403280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T22:47:51+00:00" title="January  9, 2013 10:47PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delayed response.<br/><br/>I'm definitely thinking Instrumental or Synth music. No lyrics. For example, I picked up some of the Star Trek soundtracks, which work perfectly for what I'm thinking (<a href="http://www.startreksoundtracks.com/tos/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.startreksoundtracks.com/tos/index.html</a>)... With a bunch of this music you could use a Mac program called Tangerine! to build playlists based on Beats per minute. You can analyze and drag and drop soundtracks into a format where they conform to a typical 90 or 120-minute movie with tension that rises and falls in appropriate timing.<br/><br/>My idea here is simply that players would have a firm guideline of when to ratchet the tension and when to have expository or emotional character development scenes in measured doses... an "Act Structure" for your RPGs, so to speak. This would be especially interesting for free-form or GM-less gameplay, where there is no one person guiding the action.<br/><br/>One of the things I'm thinking about is a game like Cosmic Patrol which is almost purely improvisational. I'm concerned that it would be too easy for a group of inexperienced players to push through one of these scenarios too quickly. Having a soundtrack to accompany play could make a session flow just like a movie or TV show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_403624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403624/#Comment_403624" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T17:00:09+00:00" title="January 13, 2013  5:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This works really well to pace smaller time segments too. Problem is that most RPGs take too much time to process results for this to work (but that won't stop me from one day running a game based on the first three tracks on the Inception soundtrack).<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this kind of soundtrack pacing also works best with players who are familiar with the soundtrack in question. If it's the first time they're hearing it, then changes are more likely to be abrupt and incongruous, but if they've heard it before they can dance with it. And the longer the soundtrack, the harder it will be to follow/remember it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
