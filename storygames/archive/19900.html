I've designed similar systems in contest games but haven't played them to find out how they work.<br/><br/>I do think it's possible to make everyone at the table feel like "just a player" in the sense of a player in a highly collaborative game, where I run my character and also ad-lib some environmental and backstory content.  However, I think many players who request a "just a player" role <i>really</i> want a "just a <i>character</i>-player" role, and giving them responsibility for establishing what's in the imagined room (beyond the bare details of the sparse framing you mention) is unwelcome.<br/><br/>Personally, if I'm going to do <i>any</i> GM tasks, I'm probably on board with doing <i>significant</i> GM tasks, as in most "GM-less" games you can probably think of.<br/><br/>The part of your article that excites me most is handing GM tasks off to dice and scripts rather than players.  I think the viability of this approach varies from game to game, but in a highly specific scenario game (e.g. Montsegur 1244), I can imagine populating tables with an array of virtually everything you'd need from a GM, and simply rolling for anything that isn't character action.  In a game like Montsegur, where the starting premise and set-up covers so many of the relevant bases, you wouldn't even be rolling all that frequently.\n<blockquote>What I would like to discuss here is how YOU would go about recreating that particular feeling, or if you know other games that already try to achieve such result <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>I don't know of any better published examples than Montsegur, and I don't think a "just a player" feeling is its specific goal; rather, that feeling is a byproduct of heavily front-loaded content that gets characters interacting with each other.  Once you know your castle and your predicament (and that the predicament will advance according to a script after 2 more turns) and your character's history and goals (which all center around the other characters), you simply don't need a GM for anything.  If there are more relevant characters in the scenario than there are players, then a player might need to play two characters, but each character comes with enough meat on them that it doesn't feel like dabbling in utilitarian NPCing.<br/><br/>I imagine that a Fiasco playset in a very constrained location, played by a group that workshopped all the histories and character motives into fully realized form before starting play, might achieve a similar effect.  Until the "decide how the scene turns out" part, that is.<br/><br/>My own efforts at deleting the GM have included:<br/>- Conspiracy theory game where characters encounter randomly generated facts, then theorize about connections between them, with later rolls resolving which theory turns out to be true.<br/>- Info-hunt game which comes with pre-made NPCs, where matches between NPC dispositions and chosen player-character approaches dictate whether the NPC's help moves you up or down a pre-made progress track.<br/>- Rolling for scene framing elements.<br/>- Concentrating the PCs' opposition in the form of one antagonist and assigning the "GM" to do nothing more than play that antagonist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440844/#Comment_440844" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T00:14:24+00:00" title="December 12, 2014 12:14AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David you rise interesting points.<br/>Forgive me if I write a lot in answer to them ^__^\n<blockquote>I think many players who request a "just a player" role really want a "just a character-player" role, and giving them responsibility for establishing what's in the imagined room (beyond the bare details of the sparse framing you mention) is unwelcome.</blockquote>\nThis.<br/>In my personal experiences what I've seen at the table is...<br/><br/>In very traditional games (let's say D&amp;D3.xFinder or Vampire) depending on the mood of the day you have Players being allowed or even encouraged by the GM to actually do very GM-y stuff.<br/>Like adding non-critical details to the description of a scene (it rains, there is a weird light coming from the moss, the air smells funny, etc).<br/>Like temporarily playing the role of a secondary NPC.<br/>Like establishing a lot of important backstory just because it is supposed to be part of their PC's background.<br/>Like coming up with ideas and suggestions about "what should happen next", maybe disguised as in-game brainstorming among PCs or out-game straight questions about Player's expectations and speculations... that are then (secretly) used by the GM to decide what will happen in the end.<br/>[ <i>yeah, I planned it for the very beginning! you just <b>guessed</b> it right, bravo!</i> ]<br/><br/>It really depends on the unwritten rules followed by the individual play group, but in my experience these things happen very, very often.<br/>The reason why they don't bother the Players (or the GM) is that they usually happen in small bits, and only in so far as the Player is inspired to offer such contribution, and they don't deal with the "really important stuff" (aka : conflict resolution / conflicts of interest).<br/><br/>So, while I am the first to admit that no illusion will ever be exactly the same as the real thing, I surely am striving to go as close as possible. The techniques I've described in the article all help the participants do exactly what you said: \n<blockquote>a player in a highly collaborative game, where I run my character and also ad-lib some environmental and backstory content</blockquote>\nThrough playtest I've seen how, as the number of participants grows, this feeling increases as the GM-y activities are more and more diluted among all the persons at the table.<br/>In a 2 people game of <b><a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com/2014/10/tactical-ops.html" rel="nofollow">Tactical Ops</a></b> the GM-y stuff is not too intrusive, but clearly felt.<br/>Already in a 3 people game the feeling is incredibly lessened.<br/>In a 4 people game it is basically not felt, the illusion is at its strongest and most effective level.<br/>A 5 people game offers the same effectiveness, but in my experience it is also the upper limit in regards to the amount of people the game can manage before becoming too chaotic to enjoy; so while 5 is perfectly OK, I've seen how 6 is definitely one too many.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com/2014/12/fateless.html" rel="nofollow">FateLess</a></b> is still being tested. All the mentioned techniques are present and I'm seeing the same results, when your PC is in a scene you feel a lot like when you are "<i>just a Player</i>". But I've also noticed how, it being a game about individual characters rather than a group of characters, the time you spend in scenes where your PC is not present is considerably increased; this hinders a bit the illusion as you spend more time doing GM-y things on other people's scenes than doing Player-ish things in your own PC's scenes.<br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-\n<blockquote>I can imagine populating tables with an array of virtually everything you'd need from a GM</blockquote>\nA technique I haven't mentioned in the article (but maybe I should have) is the "Opposition". I think it's right up your alley <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><b>Tactical Ops</b> and <b>FateLess</b> handle how the Opposition is triggered in different ways, but then the mechanic is basically the same.<br/>I wrote a list of "functional events" that represent problematic situations that typically a GM would use to shake things up in a scene... a bit like the list of GM Moves offered by the PbtA games.<br/>When the right circumstances are met, you ROLL on the list.<br/><br/>This allows Players to <b>distance</b> themselves from the act of "deciding what happens".<br/><br/>Something triggers the Opposition, you roll and you discover that something unexpected happened (being isolated or cut out from support/resources? having someone/something escalate and become more aggressive? etc).<br/>Now the only thing the Players (all of them, whoever feels like it or has a ready idea) will flesh out how such functional problem specifically happens in the specific fiction.<br/>Nine times out of ten the answer is so obvious and banal that it takes no effort, and sometimes the feeling is like "<i>But of course THIS happened, what did you expect out of a situation like that?!</i>".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440856/#Comment_440856" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T14:03:13+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  2:03PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2014 6:22PM by Paul88.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lets create an invisible Gm but with a bit of the Kudos of the ouija board.

Excuse the pun.<br/>This might only work for certain games which are heavily loaded like Montsegur 1244.<br/><br/>Check out this pic of carved stones from the <a href="http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/scotlandballs.htm" rel="nofollow">Neolithic or early Bronze Age</a>, between 3200 and 1500 BC, my mind boggles of their use, but would be great for a prehistoric game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440865/#Comment_440865" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T18:17:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  6:17PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2014 6:21PM by Paul88.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doh!

I think that unless you have a very specific scenario to play, you can't really front-load game content, like in Montsegur.<br/>I'm working on a lovecraftian horror game, and THAT uses a sort of map... depending on where you are on the map, you have different elements at your disposal to describe the scene. It's a bit like what happens with the "chapters" of Montsegur.<br/><br/>But it's not ideal for an open ended game, like <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com/2014/10/tactical-ops.html" rel="nofollow">Tactical Ops</a> and <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com/2014/12/fateless.html" rel="nofollow">FateLess</a> are.<br/>Besides, the aim is not to perfectly 100% emulate the presence of a GM (I don't think it's possible) but rather to summon a feeling that is "<b>close enough</b>".<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Other ideas on how to achieve that? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440889/#Comment_440889" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-14T18:47:49+00:00" title="December 14, 2014  6:47PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2014 10:31AM by Paul88.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Fetish sums it up good ! and puts in a place which could be creepy Ha,<br/>A sort of shrine/fetish could work in a game but like  you say its detracting for what your trying to achieve.

So another character could challenge its interaction. <br/>Once his influence is spent the character could be challenged for authorship of the story, or not if players like the way its going?<br/>I see this as a true story creating game not a game to win or lose,<br/>Its a bit like playing in a dream or inside our selves and not in the world.<br/><br/>Just another curve ball <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440905/#Comment_440905" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T12:47:29+00:00" title="December 15, 2014 12:47PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very neat trick the one used in EtS! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>But I don't think that what you then suggested would go in the right direction... you basically elevate one Player to the role of GM, having full and clear control over a scene and even backstory elements... then being challenged by others for such control (it reminds me a lot of the mechanics in <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/127886/Blood-Red-Sands" rel="nofollow">Blood Red Sands</a>)<br/><br/>This way you concentrate / coagulate the GM-y activities, you create a GM-stick so to say, and have players vie for its control, to BE a GM for a little while.<br/><br/>I instead am putting my money on the very opposite... I'm trying to dilute and diffuse the GM-y activities so much that, even though they ARE carried out somehow, there is no one clear GM, no one obvious source of authority and decisions.<br/><br/><b>Actual Play</b> from last week's <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com/2014/12/fateless.html" rel="nofollow">FateLess</a> playtest.<br/><br/>One of the PCs is a cop.<br/>He is surreptitiously investigating his wife's car accident (long story behind this situation) and has found out a connection with the public spokesman of an insurance corporation and wants to run a background check on  him using police computers.<br/><br/>At the table the Player (Claudia) framed the scene:<br/>Location = one of my colleagues' private office<br/>Time = around lunch time<br/>PC Cast = just me <br/>NPC Extras = none<br/><br/>She described her cop rummaging around the computer until he finds the password scribbled on a note, as the office belongs to an old and not really tech savvy colleague, then accessing the terminal and starting the search.<br/><br/>No one felt like arguing. We were already imagining the cop having access to the station's computers, so the bit about the noted down password was just nice colour and nobody challenged it. There was a test made somewhere in here to see if the cop managed to search the police station's network without rising alarms or leaving traces, but it was a success with no particular complications...<br/><br/>"<i>So</i>" Claudia asks the table "<i>what do I find?</i>"<br/><br/>After a moment of silence where all Players look at each other expectantly, someone (can't remember who) just asks an obvious question: "<i>is there something to find? is there a criminal record at all?</i>"<br/>A moment later someone else exclaims "<b><i>Quoth!</i></b>" which is the ritual word to say "let's ask the die" ... grabs a die, rolls and... YES, there is a criminal record about that guy.<br/><br/>Other questions from all Players soon follow, one after the other:<br/>- is it accessible by you or is it secreted? YES, it's accessible from the internal police network and with cop credentials<br/>- is it an old juvenile record? NO, it relates to his adulthood but it's from many years ago, before he became a public figure<br/>- is it about a serious crime? YES, something penal, something worth jail time<br/>- is it related to violence? YES<br/>- has anyone died? NO<br/>- did he go to jail for it? YES<br/>- was it property related, like vandalism? NO<br/>- was it of political nature, a statement of some sort, activism? NO<br/><br/>At this point players were starting to run out of ideas about the nature of the crime. This created another brief silence. And again this prompted someone to give an input "<i>It's obvious the file must have been censored! Parts are missing, there is enough to make it look normal but if you try check for the details the data just is not there</i>" which prompted another player "<i>Yes, the report is very verbose, pages and pages of bureaucratic legalese nonsense, but if you look for clear hard facts most of them are not there</i>" and another player "<i>Damn corporations! How far can they reach?</i>"<br/><br/>Note: the die only says YES or NO; all the details I mentioned after a Yes or No were mentioned because some player spontaneously added them, because it made sense in her head and it felt natural and obvious to say it out loud... this in turn influenced everybody else's ideas, thus the direction and shape of their subsequent questions.<br/>The same happened when the die's answers started to rule out all obvious and expected possibilities; the human brain just found (given the cop-crime-corporations circumstances) the next best explanation for the non-congruous data: it's a cover up! something is missing!<br/><br/>Note 2: it still might NOT be a corporate cover up! The ONLY thing that can ever be described in the game are the thoughts, actions, and <b>perceptions</b> of the PCs ... so the cop (and Claudia along with him, and all us other Players along with her) is still wondering what might actually be the meaning of all this? is it a corporate cover up? cop corruption? political manipulation? a robot conspiracy?<br/><br/>It's very different than acting as a GM and establishing a piece of backstory that you know is TRUE unless someone else takes the GM-stick and ret-cons it.<br/>It's instead very similar to when you <b>just play your PC</b> and the GM (which is not you, nor another of your <b>fellow players</b>) tells you what your PC sees and finds out ... but maybe it's not all, maybe it's wrong or misleading, maybe... and you try to guess what the evil smile on the GM's face might mean <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Again, it's not exactly the same same same. But it gets pretty damn close, at times.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I would like to see more techniques that might help me go in that direction. Giving <b>less</b> GM-y responsibilities and prerogatives to the Players by having them be more diluted/diffused/atomized.<br/><br/>Oh my, this sounds like researching a <b>Homoeopathic GM</b>!

It was mostly used for a Tenra Bansho-like game, where there were many moments when players got separated scenes. So, this was mainly pointed at giving other players something interesting to do while their characters weren't on the scene.<br/><br/>The cards featured indications like:<br/>-You can add a sfx sound to the current scene.<br/>-You can control an opponent minion and describe how it dies, if that happens.<br/>-You can add a enviromental feature that nobody noticed before.<br/>-You can change the weather. In a dramatic way if possible.<br/>-You can control an opponent boss until the end of the scene.<br/>-You can narrate how an npc safely escapes from a confrontation.<br/>-You can introduce a messenger who delivers an important information to someone in the scene. Said information is up to you.<br/>-You can adjudicate an automatic success to a single action for any one character in the scene.<br/>-You can adjudicate an automatic failure to a single action of one character on the scene.<br/>-You can add a single detail to a description made by another player.<br/>-You can add a enviromental detail that can be used as an advantage in battle (a chandelier in a bar, a crack in the ceiling of a cave, a great place to hide for one ambusher, etc)<br/><br/>Some of the cards featured things that meant bonuses for the player's characters in later scenes, when certain conditions were meet. Like "you get an aiki point if you get an NPC killed in a spectacular way", or something like that (I can't remember what it was but it was better than this example). In the end I found out that giving the players a reward for contributing to the scene was totally unnecessary and even counterproductive, as some players insisted on doing things that damaged the fiction a bit for the sake of obtaining bonuses.<br/><br/>A couple of details to make this a more useful idea: <br/>-The cards weren't used all the time trough the scene, and the effects of their use needed to be given additional coherence by a facilitator able to built over the player's input. At some point every player started to help to give more coherence to other player's input, that was awesome.<br/>-It would need to be adapted according to the setting and technology present (instead of a messenger it could be an incoming call for modern settings, for example)<br/><br/>I think it could be used to support the Fetish, but this would definitely need some other devices to become a virtual GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440965/#Comment_440965" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-19T08:10:22+00:00" title="December 19, 2014  8:10AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2014 8:14AM by Paul88.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your actual play is where I like to game.
