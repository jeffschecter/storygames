He was tired and down and taking stock, so the talk turned out pretty gloomy, with him casting a rather dark picture on the current gaming business here in Austria. We talked a bit about the lack of real "entry level" game, how the trend to bigger, prettier hardcovers isn't a good or successful one and how many corporations are making big mistakes in how they produce and market their games.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As you can imagine, I took that chance to talk a bit about Indie games, and while he wasn't really sold on the idea of stocking a couple of them, he seemed interested when I offered to lend him a couple of my Indie Games to check them out, so I consider that a success. (We also talked about other stuff, like daydreaming about a shop with infinite money would look like, his plans with the shop in general and how he plans to spend his next vacation, so it wasn't all gloom. It was a nice talk.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>I also told him (And here comes the real topic of this thread.) about my long-standing plans to run a couple of games at the upcoming convention he's organizing and how I failed to do that the last four of them. (I'm shy and lazy. Bad combination for con games. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> ) But he gave me positive feedback and made the idea of telling complete strangers about those games I'm all hot for and maybe running a demo or two look not all that horrible and scary, so I went away strengthened in my resolve to finally actually do this.<br/><br/>And it made me think about the Indie games I had and what I wanted to demo and talk about. Some of the games I have make for better demos then others. Wushu/Roanoke can be played with almost zero prep, while something like Reign needs a bit more time and work. A Mechaton game can be played for a while, but even so any given round looks interesting and gives a good impression of the game as a whole. On the other hand, something like Dogs might need a longer bit of play to showcase "the Awesome".<br/><br/>So, I've been thinking: What Indie games make for good demos? And which of them are available at IPR? (Because I kinda sorta hope to also target Harry with these demos and maybe get him and other FLGS' to stock some of them, which is probably easier with IPR then something that only come directly from the author or Lulu.)<br/><br/>(BTW, with "demo" I mean something less then a typical oneshot. I can't see myself running a whole game there unless there is lots of interest or no interest at all, so I've been thinking of doing short intros between 15 minutes and one hour when people are interested.)<br/><br/>I've been meaning to buy some games from IPR anyway and now I even have an excuse to do so. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123042/#Comment_123042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T10:49:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 10:49AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're talking 5-10 minutes, all you need to do with Reign is roll the dice for chargen.<br/><br/>There's also a fantastic demo of Dogs which is basically a blurb from the book about your brother going to kill his wife for cheating on him.

For fast demoes, I'm of the opinion that people should be immediately able to tell what something does, and what all their resources are.

Like, I would feel bad to come to the con with 10 demo kits and then only manage to demo 4 of them. So I'm ever so slowly reducing my "Wanna demo!!!" list, but maybe get those down REALLY well. (Hopefully, anyway.)<br/><br/>What I'm looking for now is maybe tiny flyers/cards that I could print up cheap and hand out to interested people, pointing them to other games/publishers/... beyond those that I manage to demo. IPR is great for that, because by pointing somebody there, I'm also pointing them at a shitload of cool games. But I've bene thinking maybe other designers/companies had like that already pre-designed. <br/><br/>So even if I might not be able to demo any Gumshoe or Dying Earth product, if you have a small flyer/card-with-your-name-and-website I could print cheaply, I'd hand it to anybody interested. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126762/#Comment_126762" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T06:38:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  6:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "you" above is a generic you, btw.
