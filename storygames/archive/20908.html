I'm also starting to prefer games that are more collaborative than GM driven, and just less "traditional" in general. I want to play as many games as possible and that means that if a game is crunchy it better be worth taking the time to read and learn it's rules; my time (and my gaming club members' time) is limited. I have to get rid of some of my games to make room for others and I would like your help. I like how fictioneers.net deals with rating crunchiness. I know crunchiness is subjective and involves a lot of different factors and those factors could be debated forever, but fictioneers.net provides a good practical guide. So I'm hoping this post won't become an in depth discussion or debate on the nature of "crunchiness." Here's the fictioneer.net basic Crunch Rating breakdown:\n<pre><br/><b>Crunch Rating Definitions</b><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIFF LEVEL (1-5)</span> \t<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLASS</span> \t\t<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXAMPLE</span></b><br/>1 - Super easy \t\tminigames \tDoctor Magnethands<br/>2 - Focus &amp; Imagination storygames \tDread<br/>3 - Mildly crunchy \tmodern rpgs \tApocalypse World<br/>4 - Moderately crunchy \ttrad rpgs \tD&amp;D<br/>5 - Highly crunchy \tcrunchy rpgs \tSpaceMaster<br/></pre>\nDon't get to hung up on the "class" categories to much...they are just loose groupings for the purpose of a general guide and there are many exceptions. Fictioneers also classifies whether a game is mostly a GM type of game or mostly a Collaborative Storytelling type of game. Perhaps a good practical guide, for the purpose of this post, would have a breakdown like this:<br/>1 - Mostly GM<br/>2 - Mixed <br/>3 - Mostly Collaborative Storytelling <br/><br/>The problem is that fictioneers.net doesn't list all of the games that I'm considering getting rid of. I want to get rid of most of my games that rate a 4 or 5 on crunchiness scale above, unless I think that they are worth investing the time into. I also prefer games with more Collaborative Storytelling elements. Here is where all of you come in...I haven't read the games listed below so I'm a little unsure of which ones I should get rid of and which ones I should keep. (I tried to list the games that seemed like they might rate a 4 or 5 on the crunch scale). I'm hoping you will look at the list of games below and rate a couple of the ones you are familiar with in terms of the "Crunchiness" scale above and "GM/Mixed/Collaborative" scale above. A rating for D&amp;D might look like this:<br/><br/>D&amp;D - 4:1<br/>Which is shorthand for:<br/><i>Game</i> - <i>Crunch Rating 4 (Moderately Crunchy)</i>:<i>Mostly GM </i> <br/><br/>I think these ratings could also be useful to others. For example, someone with a fictioneers.com account could add the list of games rated below to the website's "Games" database, and any story gamer wondering about the level of crunch in one of the games listed or whether or not the game was primary GMish or Collaborative in nature might find the thread useful. Anyway, in case people are interested I will keep a list of the games with their ratings below in this post. <br/><br/>I know the list below has a lot of games, but if you could just rate 1 or 2 that you are familiar with it would be super helpful and I would be very grateful.

However, the fundamental mechanic involves rolling for who has narrative control rather than rolling for success, which moves it pretty firmly into the "mixed" category for collaboration, possibly even edging towards collaboration.<br/><br/>Ryuutama - 3:1.5 :P<br/><br/>Ryuutama is pretty simple at its base level; There are four stats represented by dice sizes, and you roll them in pairs.  There's a fair number of different cases where you roll specific things for specific tasks, but there are very few edge cases or additional rules.  It's definitely lighter than D&amp;D.

Because the game features a very character-driven structure, no GM plot whatsoever and player-mandated starting situations, I categorized it as "mixed"; the GM is mostly limited to refereeing the rules, setting up some NPCs for the PCs to knock over, and bringing phantasmagoric color, just like other games with weak GM roles.<br/><br/>(In fact, a comparison: <i>Legends of Alyria</i> has exactly the same type of GM role as Sorcerer does. <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is comparable as well, the only difference being that TMW doesn't front-load the player authority, but rather has the players choose their moment during play to reveal their character backstory.)<br/><br/>I can see how one might categorize it the other way, but I think it's a bit misleading to categorize Call of Cthulhu (or D&amp;D) and Sorcerer in the same way if the intent is to have a sense for how collaborative the overall gameplay is. The lack of a "Rule Zero" and the careful buy-in the game establishes at the start with the chargen rules and the relationship map and such makes it a very different game in practice, much more like the other games characterized as "mixed" on that list. Practically the only part of the Sorcerer fictional space that is not under significant player influence all the time is the supernatural; the demons and how magic works and all that wacky stuff is for the GM to figure out and present, but that's mostly a big fat exception in a game that otherwise invites the players to set up their own relationship maps and use conflict rules to get their way against all comers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459005/#Comment_459005" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T04:28:12+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  4:28AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2017 4:28AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>P.S.

The Sorcerer GM, on the other hand, has a <i>lot</i> to do on the "what's going on and could be going on in the world with all these NPCs" front, making sure the demons pursue their needs and the kicker figures apply the kicker pressures, and prepping bangs, and maybe also running the show using all the bob/cross/etc. techniques Ron outlines.  So, I dunno, maybe "2" is more accurate than "1", but I didn't want anyone getting any sort of "GM-lite" impression.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Plus I'll disagree with you on "1-3 session character arcs".  As far as I know, session 1 of actual play is almost always development and getting into the story.  "3-4 session arcs" is more typical of what I've read.  It seems to me that "play your character" is the significant majority of the player role.  Maybe that's just how I prefer to play, but I vaguely remember hearing that was the norm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459014/#Comment_459014" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T17:11:47+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  5:11PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I WANT DICTIONARY OF MU!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459017/#Comment_459017" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T19:36:51+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  7:36PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I WANT DICTIONARY OF MU!!</blockquote>\nI kind of owe David for the help he has given me in designing my game, but I'm willing to sell it to you very cheaply if you are interested <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459018/#Comment_459018" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T19:42:30+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  7:42PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Eero, just wondering why you aren't into 7th Sea (2nd Edition), REIGN, &amp; Legend of the Five Rings (4th Edition), being that I'm looking to weed out some of my games.

I don't know how to say this without offending people who like those games, but I've personally found them somewhat vapid - I have my difficulties enjoying mainstream games at the best of times, and those are pretty much quintessential '90s adventure games (thinking particularly of the two AEG titles). The settings of each are not to my tastes (reasons ranging from a dislike of lazy historical fantasy to dislike of mild high fantasy), and the gameplay is same old, same old. Of course there's a lot of effort put into them, and the art of 7th Sea and Legend of the Five Rings is colorful, and there are always likeable details in big games like this, but overall I'm left indifferent to them.<br/><br/>I'm particularly diffident about 7th Sea because its brand of ersatz-European historical fantasy really grates on my nerves in practice, when I read the game text. The fact that I've been playing a lot of historical fantasy over the last few years doesn't help things - the more competence you have for playing a game set in historical Europe, the more pointless the parade of knock-off historical details in that game starts to feel. LotFR is of course the same, with the dubious virtue of being set in the Orient, meaning that it's less <i>my</i> history and more <i>their</i> history, making it less annoying for me personally, even as I know intellectually that it's just as bad (or good, depending on if the ersatz-approach to historical fantasy has utility for you).<br/><br/>(To make it clear: I have nothing except subjective arguments against these games. Take a person with a different background, who reacts differently to their aesthetic propositions, and who doesn't have similar games already filling up their needs for mid-crunchy traditional adventure games, and they might be completely reasonable in loving those titles. I've never gotten to the stage of actually playing these, but a read of the game texts indicates entirely passable game design in technical terms, no worse than other games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459020/#Comment_459020" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T20:31:55+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  8:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to be pedantic, 7th Sea: 2nd Edition, like... just came out.

Is it very different? Mostly it's the setting that I dislike, anyway, but obviously the new game might have something new and exciting to offer.<br/><br/>Regarding the mechanics of these three games, I would characterize the AEG games as solidly mainstream (with the proviso that I am probably thinking of earlier editions than the most recent one for both of these titles; rpgs rarely completely jump ship the way D&amp;D did with the 4th edition, but it is possible that my experience is simply outdated if the new editions are radically different), while Reign is a hybrid, similar to say Fate - essentially traditional in systemic terms, but with progressive flourishes on the mechanical level.<br/><br/>To give a very short overview, the two AEG games fall into the genre of crunch-oriented character-build games with lots of setting flavour and strong GM plot; modern D&amp;D is a reasonable comparison, but even better is <i>Earthdawn</i>, if that one's familiar. Although the dicing systems and such are thoroughly different, PCs still form adventuring parties, individual PCs are built out of specific mechanical powers and maneuvers, and so on. If you're familiar with <i>Exalted</i>, I think that it's another very close comparison; I wouldn't be surprised if Exalted was directly influenced by 7th Sea and Deadlands and similar '90s games (obviously including WoD games) when it first came out, it's that close philosophically - we really should have a more specific name for this style of game than "'90s mainstream", it's such a prominent part of the rpg field. Fate is a more recent example of an essentially similar game - you could easily play either of those AEG settings with Fate, just swap in new Fate-specific character-building crunch.<br/><br/>Reign is a bit different mechanically, but not very far, I think - mostly it's more lightweight, and relies more on an universal conflict resolution system and slightly less on specific combat mechanics (which are a major feature of both 7th Sea and LotFR). Specialized wacky dicing mechanics, of course, are par for the course in this sort of game. I have the feeling that true fans of the genre would see a distinction between Reign and the other two titles, but I might view this whole field from so far away that the details blur and it all looks the same to me: build up some colorful adventurers, give them special mechanical doodahs off the build lists, celebrate the uniqueness of your own character in the context of the adventuring party, let the GM bring the setting and the situation, and then it's off to adventure. "Traditional rpg", as we often say to characterize this sort of thing, and specifically the '90s variety where spell-lists and mechanically streamlined fighter classes give way to splat-based pointbuy and uniformly crunchy character specs, and setting reigns supreme as a creative focus of the GM's efforts.<br/><br/>It is not unlikely that somebody else can tell you about these games in much more detail; I'm going by memories from having read them all about 10-15 years ago. A new thread would probably scare out some people who've played lots of ORE (the rules system of Reign) games in their time, instead of just reading a couple of them.

I have never played either version.  Though I doubt it has made any really substantive changes to the setting - either you like the "European pastiche" schtick, or you don't, and since they are committed to that approach, their changes probably amount to "rearranging the deck chairs" from your perspective. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>   They might've fixed the mechanics up some though.\n<blockquote>Fate is a more recent example of an essentially similar game - you could easily play either of those AEG settings with Fate, just swap in new Fate-specific character-building crunch.</blockquote>\nThis is an interesting assertion, but I'm not sure I can hold with it.  Fundamentally in my mind, the 90s mainstream era of game is categorized by big lists of powers and abilities - if you have Presence 4, that means you get these specific abilities.  If you have the Two Weapon Fighting Feat, it means you get this specific set of bonuses/allowances.  Fate doesn't really have anything like this, so I don't know if I can think of it as coming out of this tradition. It seems too different to me.  It also lacks the conceit of "all these guys form a party with unique roles" that seems to tie all these others together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459027/#Comment_459027" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T22:05:55+00:00" title="January  5, 2017 10:05PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate has breadth, there are different applications of it - I only skimmed the crowdfunded generic text edition so maybe it doesn't emphasize the power lists that much? The big flagship games are totally like this, though. <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, for example: it has both "party with unique roles", as well as specific special maneuvers that allow the characters to break otherwise general resolution rules. I'm sure that there's a version of Fate out there that doesn't have these elements, but all the ones I remember do have them. (Well, was there a scifi game with wormholes connecting different planets done with Fate? Did that one have lists of special powers?)<br/><br/>Of course we are discussing the necessarily vague concept of "being like" something else. Fate is obviously a newer design, more of age with Reign than 7th Sea, and that does show in all sorts of little details, I won't deny that. If we experience the differences between these games differently, it's probably because we emphasize different aspects as important: to me Fate is obviously very similar to 7th Sea because both feature highly unique heroic adventurers in swashbuckling adventures, working team-based, within the context of a GM's setting and plot, powered by a streamlined task resolution system and exception-based character crunch. Somebody else might not think that those are very important features, while concentrating on something else (the dice, for instance - completely different dice in those games), and they might thus come to conclude that the games are really different from each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459028/#Comment_459028" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T22:15:25+00:00" title="January  5, 2017 10:15PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always kindof forget about Spirit of the Century, because it was SO FRUSTRATING to us.

It's sort of like how you can play TSoY (or Solar System, rather) with minimal or maximal crunch environments. I can see how the low-crunch setting would find favour overall; my experience of the scene is that crunch-lovers tend to gravitate to and be very faithful to games like D&amp;D, GURPS, Hero System and such, leaving Fate and similar games to fight it out in the mid-to-light crunch ranges; essentially the fact that a given person was still looking for their go-to adventure game at the time when Fate came out suggests that they may have been in the market for something lighter than GURPS.<br/><br/>(I compare Fate to GURPS in these threads so much because of how fond I grew of GURPS last winter, when I played in a campaign for several months. A very interesting game, gamers like me who completely missed it in our youth should definitely take a look. It's basically a more detailed take on games like Fate and such, except it embraces the joy of number-crunching action simulation all the way instead of going all narratively about it.)<br/><br/>I have to say that, going strictly by memory, I personally would prefer more crunch rather than less for Fate. The special powers and such belong in a game like that to my mind, to properly highlight character moments. Or if not, then I want to go all the way to Heroquest-like abstract trait contest mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459047/#Comment_459047" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-06T18:12:11+00:00" title="January  6, 2017  6:12PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More recent iterations of FATE still have special powers, but not long lists of them, just guidelines for how to create your own.

Don't forget the extensive combat tables - determining your roll under number based on your level and the opponent's HD - charts for polearms, counting up encumbrance to determine your movement rate, rules for tracking turns and light radius, duration of torches, overland travel in the wilderness, rules for getting lost, percentage modifiers to experience point gains, morale modifiers, weapon vs. armour modifiers... even the simplest D&amp;D products tended to have all of the above and more. While many people ignored these in practice, that still makes Basic D&amp;D, in my opinion, as crunchy as a "modern RPG" like Apocalypse World.)<br/><br/>(Granted, "crunch" is very subjective. Still, I'd be surprised if most people found Apocalypse World's, say, experience rules more "crunchy" than Basic D&amp;D's. In Apocalypse World, you mark experience when you roll a highlighted stat, and when you reach five you get an advance, which you pick on your sheet. In D&amp;D, you are directed to add up and hand out XPs at various points in the adventure - defeating a monster, finding treasure, etc - all these must be tallied up - then dividing it between the party members, with half shares going to the hirelings. Each time, every player must apply his experience modifiers, such as adding +15% for a high stat, recalculate the total, and compare it to an individual score for his class, which is different for each character. If he levels up, there will be a number of steps to follow, which must be looked up on that class's progression in the book.)<br/><br/>(I think even 70's Basic D&amp;D's strict "by the book" play is pretty crunchy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459077/#Comment_459077" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-07T20:25:14+00:00" title="January  7, 2017  8:25PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree with SW FFG being 4-1; I'd call it 4-2 myself.

In some ways it's VERY heavily GMed, but it's also no-prep and tells you that can "switch GMs" for every chapter after the third, so it could just easily be classified as GMless, from another perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459180/#Comment_459180" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T08:44:43+00:00" title="January 11, 2017  8:44AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the classification is perfect for quick-and-dirty listing.
