I love this forum and the mods have pointed out that we nerds sometimes start dropping a lot of Forge and post-Forge lingo without explaining. And they're absolutely right and I'm often guilty of this. We need to be clear so that anyone can participate.<br/><br/>I learned about the "teeth" of IIEE from Vincent Baker's blog, and about what IIEE even is from somewhere else I can't even remember, but I'm going to explain them in my own way here with my own diagrams, OK? So that anyone who is new, don't worry, this thread is going to be self-contained.<br/><br/><strong>IIEE</strong>: how you're doing what you're doing in the game!<br/><br/>Sometimes players say things like "I want to use my climbing skill!" or they say "I want some of those cherry fruits" or they say "I want to go up that tree" or whatever. They usually jump to any one of these, you never know which and it's often weird.<br/><br/><img alt="What do they want to do? Players tend to say any one of these things and then we have to suss out, or just understand from context, the other two. I want to climb! Why do you want to climb? I want the cherry fruits! How are you going to reach the cherry fruits? I want to go up the tree! How are you going up the tree?" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/what-do-they-want-to-do.png"/><br/><img alt="How are they doing it? There are many ways to climb a tree! I use ropes! I use nails! I get a running start and try to jump up to grab a branch! I don't know, I want to know more about this tree! I use a ladder! I actually jump over to the tree from some other nearby high thing! I am slithy, I can just go up the branch easy!" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/how-are-they-doing-it.png"/><br/><img alt="What happens? Do they get any cherry fruit or do they just get pain and misery? Easy pickings! Good fruit! No, it's easy climbing but they're slow and monsters come and eat them. No, it's easy climbing but they're slow and birds take their fruit. No, it's hard to climb and they just can't get any fruit. No, it's hard to climb and they fall and get hurt or even die!" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/what-happens.png"/><br/><br/>This whole issue is what IIEE is! And IIEE at one point stood for "intent initiation execution and effect" but, the word now just means this whole thing, not just limited to those four categories. It's just what are you doing, <em>really</em> and what happens?<br/><br/>Now, what are then "teeth" in this context? Teeth are rules that help you suss out some of these things. Lack of teeth can just be you relying completely on your character sheet and never engaging any specifics of the situation: "Uh, I roll climbing" and "OK, I failed, I take 1d6 damage I guess, oh well". Or I guess it can also be the other way around? You forget that there even are rules and you just make up stuff in your own way.<br/><br/>And this is an important part: <em>it's not superimportant to have "teeth"!</em><br/>Either way of playing is <em>just fine</em>! This post is not about to try to convince you to put some teeth in your ruleset or that one ruleset does teeth better than any other.<br/><br/>Just in case your curious of why would anyone want these "teeth"? Well, some of us are currently [if "some of us currently" I mean me dredging up decade-old blogposts on Lumpley's blog] very into this thing, this part of the game play experence. We believe, rightly or wrongly, that it makes the shared imagined space come alive and things to have interesting and relatable consequences in this space.<br/><br/>Now, what are some examples of such "teeth"? The most well known is Apocalypse World. It needs to know how they're doing stuff because that helps you answer things when they go wrong and helps you be on the same page on the situation for future things they want to try. They want to know if it's rope you're climbing with because if you fail maybe the rope gets broken! They want to know if you're climbing slowly and carefully because maybe monsters come and eat you!<br/><br/>Possible (and, honestly, in AW probable) failure is one of the reasons why it's super important to know how and what exactly you are doing.<br/><br/>But now to the point of this post that's new and not just me parroting/rephrasing/trying-to-understand Vincent:<br/><br/>D&amp;D 5e has its IIEE-teeth in a very different way. And I'm not here to argue that D&amp;D is the best game or that this is the best way to do teeth. I mean I might in other threads or I might not, I might stab 5e completely in the back without a moment's notice. Who knows.<br/>But here we are:<br/><br/>In 5e, you need to know exactly how they're doing something (or exactly what they're saying when they're talking to an NPC) <em>because you have to know in order to even decide <b>which rule to use</b></em>.<br/><br/><small>In AW, you have to decide <em>which move</em> to use, if any, whether you go directly to a DM move or there's a chance for a player move. But 5e goes beyond that:</small><br/><br/>5e has attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, encounter checks / time records, insp/traits, "just talk it out", and spells. These are all competing in the same space.<br/><br/>In the tree climbing example:<br/><br/>Sometimes you just want to go "OK, I can't see how that could fail in any interesting way, let's just say it takes 10 minutes to climb up there and get those , and we do checks to see if  monsters come every 30 minutes so this 10 minutes count toward that".<br/><br/>Sometimes you want to go "Oh, wow, that looks dangerous, we have to make an ability check".<br/><br/>Sometimes you have to go "Oh, you really stepped in trouble now, make a saving throw!"<br/><br/>Sometimes you go "Wait, you said character is a town merchant, uncomfortable with nature. If you want to voluntarily fail on the tree, I'll give you insp."<br/><br/>Sometimes you want to skip over the whole thing "OK, you go out in the woods and gather up some various types of fruits and berries, we can hand wave the whole thing let's say the trip took two hours. That's four monster checks, OK with you guys?"<br/><br/>To even find out which of these it's time to use, you need to know more about the situation and the context and the time-scale you are in and things like that. Not so much about <em>intent</em> but a lot about execution and about the surrounding context.<br/><br/>So this is 5e's way, when a player just says "Oh I want to just do an arcana roll for this, can I?" or "Oh I want to just do an insight roll for this, can I?" or "Oh, I want to just do an athletics roll to get up there, can I?" you have very good reason to go "Hold on a bit" because maybe there are other ways to resolve the situation.<br/><br/>And the key phrase I use in these situations are: "What are you doing, exactly?" or "What are you saying, exactly?"<br/><br/>Don't roll unless you know for sure what the roll means (this goes out to you, YouTube DMs with your endless calls for tests).<br/>And, this sounds time consuming now but you get in the groove quickly. If you do the same things over and over in the game it'll be faster -- everytime you pick fruit isn't going to be as cumbersome as the first time you picked fruit, etc.<br/><br/>It's about what's interesting in the situation before the attempted action and what's interesting in the situation after the attempted action.<br/><br/><small>And this <em>should</em> go without saying but GMs, let your player's characters just be awesome and succeed on basic hero things. This tree climbing examle is ridiculous, even many level zero teenagers can pick fruits. It's just an analogy, not something that would really happen. OK? Over-asking on rolls is the scourge!</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454433/#Comment_454433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T18:16:32+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  6:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like your diagram and overview of the relevant dynamics!  That PNG is great.<br/><br/>Your use of "IIEE" and "teeth" is a bit counter-intuitive to me, but I don't think it interfered with me understanding your point, so rock on.<br/><br/>I think I disagree with the assessment of play that you describe, though.  I haven't played 5E, but here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>Do the game's different mechanics really reward or require that much fictional specificity?  Of your five listed "sometimes" ways to handle the climb, only two refer to D&amp;D's rules, comparing an ability check and a saving throw.  Do we need to know exactly what the character is doing and its context to make that call?  <br/><br/>The overall approach I see here, in terms of IIEE and teeth, is your group deciding whether to bother engaging the mechanics, which I'd say is equally true of every RPG.<br/><br/>In my experience, letting fictional particulars guide mechanical usage choices ("you're doing <i>exactly this</i>, so roll on Table 5") is incompatible with leaving fictional particulars undefined until the last second when they become mechanically relevant.  I don't mean it can't be done; I mean it's not <i>fun</i>.  If I don't know that this tree climb might kill me until it's time to reach for the dice, when I'm in mid-climb, then I'm controlling some weird, oblivious daredevil of a character, who's making their rope/nail/ladder/slither decisions more or less blind.<br/><br/>I mention this not because I assume you're doing that.  I'm guessing from your descriptions of "asking for more info" and the like that you're <i>not</i> doing that.  I'm guessing that, before any character actually initiates their climb, they've already determined that this is the best tree available, and the risk level is acceptable given the reward.  Either falling and dying is on the table, or it isn't.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, if I'm guessing correctly on that, then D&amp;D's mechanical options do not contribute to the "how exactly are you doing that?" component of your play at all!<br/><br/>Maybe the ability check rule lets you roll at Advantage for a particularly good "how exactly are you doing that?" description.  Maybe the saving throw rule gives you a bonus.  Maybe the rules make it matter somehow.  But the choosing between them?

At the same time, though, there's <i>tons</i> of stuff in AW where you <i>could</i> just say "I do X move" and "I get Y result".<br/><br/>The orientation text that encourages AW players to <i>choose</i> to play with extra teeth is great, but I don't think the end result is toothier than groups who choose to play D&amp;D with extra teeth.<br/><br/>(Note: I think I'm following suit here by applying the concept of "teeth" to player approaches and whatnot, rather than exclusively to rules themselves (which latter is how I understand Vincent's original usage).

It's their life insurance.)</i><br/><br/>But, that can risk blowing up to a whole new side topic and we haven't even sorted out the original issue yet, let's do that first!\n<blockquote>The thing is, though, if I'm guessing correctly on that, then D&amp;D's mechanical options do not contribute to the "how exactly are you doing that?" component of your play at all!</blockquote>\nBecause, it seems to me, that you significantly narrowed your definition of D&amp;D's mechanical options.<br/><br/>My entire point is:<br/><br/>\u2022 Ability check? Saving throw? Attack roll? The difference between these is very small and usually contigent on special conditions like hexed, exhausted etc -- but to determine which, you go to the "what are you doing, exactly" -- are they messing up? Give them a saving throw to save themselves. Are they attempting something unusual? Time for an ability check. Are they striking or shooting at it? Use an attack roll.<br/>\u2022 Just time-taking? Great for things that are methodical and thorough.<br/>\u2022 Maybe they have a spell that applies to the situation? If so, use it.<br/>\u2022 Taking an insp loss instead, in order to play to a trait? Great if they like lost their arms in the fight against the grue or they have some other in-character issue against the attepmted action.<br/>\u2022 Maybe there's a puzzle (social or otherwise) that requires them talking through things? Like "OK, I pour the red liquid in the leftmost vial, then the yellow liquid, then more of the red. What happens?" This is mechanics too -- though the mechanics aren't from the rulebook, they're from the module. There's this room in the dungeon we're playing now where you throw colored crystals into a flame and things happen. Engaging with this device is mechanical in nature even though the rule is written in natural language and executed wholly within the fictional space.\n<blockquote>Maybe the ability check rule lets you roll at Advantage for a particularly good "how exactly are you doing that?" description.  Maybe the saving throw rule gives you a bonus.  Maybe the rules make it matter somehow.  But the choosing between them?  I'm not seeing it.</blockquote>\nOh, yeah, advantage!! I even forgot about that -- yes, if you have good fictional positioning (it's not about how well you describe the positioning -- it's not a poetry or thespian competition, it's about getting an advantageous diegetic position), you get advantage!<br/>That's another teethy part, and a great one, but not the one I was thinking of here.\n<blockquote>At the same time, though, there's <i>tons</i> of stuff in AW where you <i>could</i> just say "I do X move" and "I get Y result".</blockquote>\nYes... that sucks. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454441/#Comment_454441" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T19:08:16+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  7:08PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 7:09PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the fact the I haven't played 5E is the problem here.<br/><br/>I was assuming that it functions kinda like most RPGs I grew up with in that there are different systems you engage when they come up, and whether they come up or not emerges from the fiction, and the fiction emerges from what everybody deems worth their while to play through.<br/><br/>In my experience, playing in that style, all the relevant character decisions are made relative to fictional concerns.  Then, after that, mechanics are invoked.  So, the mechanics don't impact the communication of fictional detail that leads into those choices, except insofar as the mechanics are a useful descriptive shorthand (e.g. "How hard would it be to climb that?"  "Target number 14, but AGL would help.").<br/><br/>Like you said, that's not <i>the</i> way to play, but it's the way that I understand you describing as "toothy" here, as sort of the polar opposite to "Uh, I roll climbing" and "OK, I failed, I take 1d6 damage I guess, oh well".<br/><br/>Maybe you're opting for somewhere more in the middle?<br/><br/>As for the specifics of your game and system, I think <i>constant</i> time pressure makes a big difference.

I agree with that.  It doesn't initially strike me as noteworthy... but maybe if I compare to a game like Primetime Adventures or Ganakagok or anything else where you use The One Mechanic at the end of every scene to resolve whatever's at stake... then maybe I see why you're making the point.<br/><br/>And, well, you did include "such as they are" in the thread title.  Bad reading by me?<br/><br/>I guess I just inferred a stronger stance on 5E's toothiness from the "how <i>exactly</i>" phrasing in the middle.  <i>I'd</i> call it more like "how, in enough detail to pick a mechanic."  :P<br/><br/>Re: constant time pressure, I meant that a fairly quick action like a tree climb is relevant to an advancing threat, thus rendering considerations like "Do I spend the time climbing?" and "Do I spend the time looking for an easier cherry tree?" significant.  Whether we parse it as fictional ("We're lingering in a dangerous place with mobile adversaries!") or mechanical ("Wandering monster roll every 30 mins!"), that's certainly a <i>system</i> with some teeth.\n<blockquote>in 5e it's codified in the dungeon modules themselves and sometimes differently.</blockquote>Cool.

VtM, Robotech, D&amp;D 3.5, Anima Beyond Fantasy, Pathfinder, etc... and now on 5e. Perhaps the only difference I spotted is that in D&amp;D every group I've played with, we only engaged the saving throws mechanic whenever specific rules asked for them (spells, traps in modules, etc) or when all other ways (either fictional or mechanical) for characters to avoid a threat were exhausted.<br/><br/>We've played it that way so much that we have actually interiorized that. When anyone of the GM's I know here (including myself) asks "what do you do?" we follow up with the question "and how exactly do you do that?" as a way to get complete information about the player's intent, their approach to the challenge and even as a way to make sure communication has been clear so far (because it will certainly be more obvious if it hasn't when players try an approach that makes no sense for everyone on the table)<br/><br/>Then after that, the GM decides which mechanic to engage based on... well, his guts. Perhaps the GM doesn't find the climbing scene interesting, perhaps he's are eager to narrate something else or the group has already humored that tree-climber player following him into another scene and the GM perceives their frustration. Perhaps the GM doesn't think there could be wandering monsters on the area so he rolls a weather change instead, or pulls an NPC from his list to interrupt or change the situation. Perhaps it's late in the real world and he wants to wrap things there with that scene, introducing a cliffhanger as the character reaches for the fruit so he narrates his way through the whole scene, perhaps he does the witchmountain trick and asks the player what's the fruit like or how does it taste, and tries getting inspiration from there to connect it with another thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the GM asks for initiative rolls saying that the tree is actually a pissed Ent.<br/><br/>I've gotta admit I learned a few of these tricks from other games and GMs, but definitely they are perfectly applicable to many different situations, games, players,genres and/or playstyles. And I can't say how much of these are actually reccomended in D&amp;D 5e core rules, as I've interiorized this so much that if I readed it in the rules I probably thought that it was expected to see it there and forgot about it.<br/><br/>BTW, another language thing is that definitely for me, IIEE having another meaning and all the teeth talk definitely make no sense at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454470/#Comment_454470" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T21:13:05+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  9:13PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, this shouldn't be a huge revelation but looking at lots of online games, it is! + I kinda wanted Vincent to see that I was understanding it and thinking about it even in non-AW games.<br/><br/>And yes, the tree being alive and they fight it, we've had that one too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454480/#Comment_454480" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T22:43:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2016 10:43PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with this, although I share a lot of Dave's reactions, as well (e.g. about the terminology and some other various details).<br/><br/>I think that various incarnations of D&amp;D support detailed fictional description with things like lots of different, overlapping mechanics (similar to AW in that respect) and a need for the DM to set difficulties and apply modifiers.<br/><br/>When you add in enough tension/danger for the players to be really concerned about their odds given any particular action, everyone has a strong incentive to ask for more detail and delve deeper into what's happening in the fiction. And I think that the danger/tension is a very important aspect of this, much like the time-tracking issue you two were talking about earlier.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, this may be why you're relatively happy with hit points - c.f. our other discussion - because you're using a ruleset with enough different mechanical "triggers" that you can parse different attacks and sources of damage in different ways.)<br/><br/>I'm always interested in discussing ways to do this *better*, however, whether that's a question of game design (e.g. mechanics) or just good ways to communicate at the table.<br/><br/>D&amp;D does it fairly well overall, but also fails often.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, I wonder if your description of "always playing this way" has to do with the last of games you provided in your post? They are all effectively "D&amp;D hacks", in terms of game process and the types of mechanics they provide.

(And D&amp;D can often do this in areas of the game which get more "mechanized", like a lot of D&amp;D4E's rules and typical combat in most editions. If the three categories in the diagram are basically <i>What, Why,</i> and <i>How</i>, then it's very easy to play out a D&amp;D fight while ignoring the "How" and the "Why" altogether, which, I think, is part of the reason people often struggle to make fights in D&amp;D interesting.

How about Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, then? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for focusing on intent, it's three things:<br/><br/>1. First of all, discussing intent overtly (like transparency of method) helps people communicate. I've seen too many people describe stuff their character was doing and then have to "rewind" 20 minutes later: "Whoa, whoa! No, that's not what I was trying to do at all! I thought that wearing red would frighten the monster, I wasn't hitting on him!"<br/><br/>Focusing on intent can cut through that kind of problem almost instantly. I've seen groups so vulnerable to this particular problem that half their play time goes towards "rewinding" misunderstood actions of this sort. Putting their intent out in the open makes it almost impossible to have this kind of misunderstanding.<br/><br/>2. You experienced all kinds of un-fun things in play because GMs weren't playing in a principled manner, and, instead, pushed the game in specific directions, railroaded, or whatever other thing.<br/><br/>Similarly, lots and lots of GMs (myself included) consciously or un-consciously did this with ability checks and similar rolls: since the roll handled the character's action and its success or failure, they used that as an excuse to resolve the intent themselves.<br/><br/>The classic example is the burglar trying to break into the safe. They roll a success! Great, says the GM: you cracked that safe! But, look! The stuff you were looking for isn't there. (The task is successful, as the roll said, but the player's intent has been foiled.)<br/><br/>The opposite happens, too. "You missed the bad guy... but the bullet went wide and hit a gas canister behind him. It exploded and now he's dead!"<br/><br/>What these things did was remove the authority of the "gloracle" (as I believe you call it): even a success can actually be a failure, and even a failure can be a success. Effectively, when you play this way, the roll of the dice is purely cosmetic: did your character look competent when they did this thing, or not?<br/><br/>As you know, most play methods which completely obviate the "gloracle" can lead to some pretty sketchy and some pretty awful play.<br/><br/>Focusing on intent and making it overt and transparent means we can all use the "gloracle" once more (instead of just pretending to) and develop a solid and reliable method of play.<br/><br/>3. When the consequences of any given character action are interpreted and mediated by the GM, basically all consequential actions end up being parsed by the GM. This means that, in the long-term, the entire scope and direction of the game depends on the GM's judgement. It can be very easy for GMs to fall into ruts, always send their games heading in the same direction, or frustrate player goals, and the players have no way to fix this.<br/><br/>Playing a game which puts intent front-and-center effectively allows the players much more input into where this game is going and how it will develop. Playing a game system which empowers players to do this - set their goals via clear intent - and then backs that up with mechanical horsepower (i.e. a real chance to achieve those goals) is a very, very different experience. Because there are more active parties in play, things tend to move faster - the whole game becomes more dynamic and moves in less predictable fashion.<br/><br/>This effect is really powerful! <br/><br/>A stupid example, for illustration:<br/><br/>A group of characters are stuck in a room and they don't know how to get out. <br/><br/>In a game where your intent doesn't matter, they will keep trying some things, over and over, and quite possibly never make it out (as the GM gets more frustrated). More likely, they'll get out eventually, of course, but it will still take some time.<br/><br/>In a game where you can state your intent overtly, they can simply say, "Ok, we want to get out of this room. What we're doing is setting up explosives against the East wall. OK? Let's roll for it." Once that roll is done, <i>everyone</i> knows for sure whether they can get out (a successful roll) or not (a failure). Either way, the game immediately moves on to something else, because this issue has been <b>settled</b>. They're out of the room, of they're in the room and we've determined that they cannot get out. Next scene!<br/><br/>That's powerful!<br/><br/>More importantly in the long term, it's not just a matter of pacing but also a matter of direction of play and subject matter. In a game where intent isn't stated, a GM can introduce a sorcerous witch as a "Big Bad", and then play her towards an awesome combat scene. The Paladin in the party dresses up nice and tries to compliment her and she gets pissed off, because she thinks he's mocking her (or whatever rationale, doesn't matter - the GM can think of a million things that make sense) and attacks! We get the cool fight!<br/><br/>However, we get that cool fight *every time*, because that's what the GM likes and what the GM is expecting.<br/><br/>In a game where intent is stated overtly, that player would have explained that he wants to woo the witch and take her out for dinner. None of us saw that coming! We usually just have cool fights. But now we have to deal with this intent: set a difficulty, make the rolls, whatever procedures we use. And suddenly, we have the Paladin and the Witch going on a date, or maybe even falling in love! <br/><br/>And now everyone around the table is sitting there with their mouths open because *nothing like this has ever happened in their game before*. Turns out the Paladin's player has been trying stuff like this for years, but since we never asked what his intent was or gave it mechanical weight, it never affected the game. Now suddenly all these ideas are here in play, in front of us, and the scope of our gaming broadens dramatically.<br/><br/>It's super late and I'm barely coherent, but hopefully that gives you *some* insight into what it was like for some gamers!<br/><br/>As with anything else in gaming, other groups already considered intent without the game's rules enforcing it, and so such innovations seemed pretty undramatic to them - they were doing that stuff already, so they didn't see the big deal.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454501/#Comment_454501" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T07:41:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  7:41AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, thanks!

The problem isn't usually "we had no idea what you wanted, or assumed something totally wrong" -- the problem is usually "you proceeded with an approach which is way way <i>way</i> suboptimal for your goals because we never checked in".<br/><br/>Suppose I'm the player looking for cherry fruit.  I've got it in my head that I want some.  Then at some point you, as GM, mention a cherry tree.  You're just adding color and describing the scene, and your vision of the scene includes a rather huge and intimidating cherry tree.  You describe it as such, but the part that I latch onto is, "Cherry tree!  Opportunity!"  So I start endeavoring to get those cherries, and you start responding to my efforts as befits a huge and intimidating tree, which is difficult and dangerous to climb.  The situation resolves however it resolves -- maybe I get the cherry fruit, maybe I don't, but either way significant time and effort is expended.<br/><br/>Then the characters move on from that area, through a sparse field of... cherry trees.  Which are <i>not</i> huge and intimidating.  And I could have had their fruit with no effort at all.  But I never asked if there were easier options!  And you never offered!  Because we never communicated at the "intent" stage!<br/><br/>The real point here is "don't jump into things prematurely" and obviously there are various ways to achieve that.  I can only say that, in my experience, being aware of intent, and being in the habit of communicating it, is a good one.  And, y'know, it gets us other good things too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454510/#Comment_454510" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T17:00:07+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  5:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another example I had in mind for you, David, was <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20089/the-gm-as-judge-how-to-stop-it-without-ruining-their-fun" rel="nofollow">this thread when you wanted to shove a PC</a>.<br/>That's actually a clearer example and it was cowardly of me to deliberately wish that you would've forgotten it, because our disagreements about it would be much subtler + more personal since it actually happened to you.<br/><br/>For me, the example of player putting in lots of effort at getting at the cherry fruit only to later discover a field of cherry fruit...

If you have lots of prep to lean on, you're looking forward to unexpected outcomes, and the job of the GM is "impartial referee", then telegraphing intent is *much* less important. There is even a sort of fun - as you point out - in not knowing why someone is doing something and having it revealed later, or having some totally unexpected outcome instead.<br/><br/>There is still often value in communicating intent just so you can have easier and better communication. (Imagine a business negotiation where one person thinks the client is trying to get a better product, but the client is *actually* just trying to reduce their costs. Until they figure that out, they're going to waste a lot of time.)<br/><br/>Another typical example is the "people trying to escape from a locked room" thing I mentioned earlier. I've so often seen things like the players spending a half hour planning an elaborate way to fill the room up with water so they can float to the top, only to get to the end of the whole process and have the GM say, "Oh! That's what you guys were going for? No, that doesn't work, because the ceiling is way higher than you've been imagining it to be. You'll have to try something else, sorry." (Or some other non-obvious fictional detail which was miscommunicated or misheard.) <br/><br/>If someone had stated the intent of the plan, that fictional detail would be brought up immediately, avoiding the whole rigmarole.<br/><br/>However, if you imagine just about <i>any other kind</i> of gaming, and particularly the types where the GM's job is to intentionally provide antagonism for the PCs' hopes and dreams, you'll see that this because WAY MORE important. You just happen to be playing in a part of the sandbox where this particular tool doesn't make as huge a difference, I think. (And, as you said, sometimes surprising the GM by withholding intent makes it easier for the GM to be an objective referee, which can even be a bonus! Not so in, say, <i>My Life with Master</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454521/#Comment_454521" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T19:01:37+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  7:01PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also\u2026 it's also not a player-&gt;DM thing, it's the other way around, too<br/>Last thursday, I was DMing an NPC.

I understood teeth in the meaning of gears' teeth, and the above seems an example of gears [i]not[/i] engaging: the player wants to climb, or to get the cherries, or to go up the tree, and the game provides no clear link from the fiction to the mechanics. Sometimes wanting the cherries might result in a saving throw, sometimes wanting to climb might result time spent climbing without a check, sometimes wanting the cherries might result in an ability check.<br/><br/>It seems to me that this is a case of the DM bridging the gap between the gears, rather than any sort of game's inherent teeth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454556/#Comment_454556" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T18:40:09+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  6:40PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again, this shouldn't be a huge revelation but looking at lots of online games, it is!</blockquote>\nDo you have a link to illustrate?

I've been interiorizing processes even more than I thought. I just noticed that in our campaigns, when the answers to "what do you do?" and "how do you do that?" weren't enough to let the other side suppose correctly the intent behind, we often ended up asking: "Ok, what's exactly your intention?" which was always fully translated as "Ok, I get that you're trying to surprise me by hiding your intent, but it's mudding the comunication so just show up your cards and we can get to what happen next"<br/><br/>On top of that, we've been struggling for years to hack/perfect systems so they wouldn't generate unfair situations like the GM purposely misinterpretating player's intent to railroad the heck out of the game, something that happened a lot with two of the GM's we used to play with. If we could have identified this particular issue before, it would have been a totally different story.<br/><br/>Well, to be honest, we somewhat ended up learning to play that way and having fun with it. It's just a matter of getting used to the additional layer of metagaming over the usual RPG. It works as a mechanism to keep players attentive, as missing a single GM's or player's description, or phrasing your actions wrongly could lead to the other side turning it against you. And there was also all the game of misleading the other side about your intent so you could get with it even without rolling.<br/><br/>While both GMs railroaded a lot, derraling the game was another part of the fun at some point. But eventually this ended up generating too much frustration for some of us, to the extent of misinterpretating most of these practices as toxic ones, while it was just that <i>we thought we were playing another game</i> and never actually agreed to these unwritten rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454664/#Comment_454664" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T19:50:28+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  7:50PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was talking to Paul outside the forums and I realized something that I want to point out here too.<br/><br/>Intent is great.

The GM says, "Ok, on a success, you scare the crowd and everyone goes silent. On a miss, they all go silent but also you're immediately spotted by the police." <br/><br/>But what if the whole point of my action was to create a distraction, so my friend could break open the trunk at the back of the room without anyone hearing the noise?<br/><br/>The GM has just totally denied me any chance of doing that: either way, my intent fails. <br/><br/>Sometimes that kind of thing is appropriate in a game; in most games, however, it's way more fun and way more player-empowering to allow intent to succeed.<br/><br/>I think the best compromise is something like the Otherkind dice/7-9 result option: the player gets their intent but ALSO something goes wrong. You get the important forward-moving action of the successful intent (yeay! you manage to draw enough attention that your friend can get the trunk open!) and also the GM's input in terms of the problems with your approach (e.g. you're immediately spotted by the police). The game now moves ahead while incorporating both players' input and gives everyone something to build on.<br/><br/>For some groups, stating intent overtly/outright is really key to this.<br/><br/>There's also the "player empowerment" thing going on. Why is this important? The players have cool ideas, and will contribute fun stuff to your game. If the GM or the game system is providing both the positive and the negative stakes of any given resolution, it's effectively like it's just the GM playing the game, with a randomizer to decide which of the GM's visions is dominant. <br/><br/>This means less player input into the game, and fewer unexpected developments. Overall, the game is less "alive" and free, and it becomes more work to GM. (However, in a group that has trouble policing tone, more GM control could be a benefit - if your players *want* a more consistent game tone AND they cannot police themselves to do so, handing the control to one player who CAN could potentially benefit the group. That's relatively rare, in my opinion, although there is often a *short-term* adjustment period when people are "trying out the ropes" and they go a little bit too far with their newfound freedom.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454669/#Comment_454669" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T20:07:49+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  8:07PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2016 8:08PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>[*] Perkins revealed that they were a good way of letting the players start to understand the resolution system with low stakes, and that's a good point of course.<br/><br/>Except... if there are NO stakes, it looks weird.</blockquote>\nWhat Perkins revealed WOULD be true, if, as you point out, it actually did that.

Nobody knows what's going to happen. Perhaps the fighter was experienced enough to tell the difference, but again I'd probably put that information behind a perception roll geared at more combat-able characters, the ones with most chances of being able to size their opponents with a single look.<br/><br/>Then there is passive perception, which I noted down on my DM screen to keep it handy. I always roll secretly against that mostly because it saves from some needless metagaming from the player's side and kinda ruins their reaction, but this is more a personal concern. OTOH I'm perfectly okey if players notice me rolling in secret and start asking for perception rolls at the darkness.<br/><br/>Then again, if it's information I need to give so the game can go on, no rolls required, either all the PCs or the ones that make more sense know about it or notice in the spot.<br/><br/>But there's one thing I will always thanks AW and the internet for teaching me: every roll should mean something. And a failed roll shouldn't mean the character failed; it's instead a totally great oppotunity to present challenges and opponents as tricky, ominous, harder to beat, sacary, etc. Your ranger rolled a 1? It doesn't translate at him breaking his bow or shooting an arrow into his partner's back by mistake, but into the goblin maneuvering in an uncanny way in the last moment and having you fall for the feint. Oh no! the Fighter may have fallen for it too! Let's give him a perception check to notice and compare their AC vs. the attack roll if the perception chek fails.<br/><br/>Now it's those moments the ones that allow me to turn a totally forgettable monster or NPC into an opponent with distinctive characteristics. For example on another occassion my group of players was facing a mix of goblins and bugbears, the Cleric failed an attack roll with a spell. Instead of just saying "you miss" I narrated how the paladin, who was prone at the moment next to the cleric, was able to see the aura of the god of the Cleric behind him, and as the ray was about to hit the bugbear, he saw behind him the aura of a different god, protecting the bugbear. It made sense, it presented the scene in another, different light. The bugbear got killed in the next exchange of blows, but by then it was a character, not just a bunch of stats. <br/><br/>The bugbear leader was created in the same fashion and the rolls turned it into a really fearsome and hated character. All I needed was a few traits to make it distinctive, but the players emotions all came from the dice and only later I found how strong they were. There's definitely a source of player investment worth of your time and attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454686/#Comment_454686" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T21:53:01+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  9:53PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes it can make sense to reveal difficulty numbers after the player has <i>committed</i> to the roll but before the roll is actually made.

You see, we got used to, well, let's call it "retroactive trust". In practice it means that yes, players do a jump of faith there, but then they see me uphold the same rules or numbers consistently, and heard a good explanation supported by the game mechanics then the numbers or the rules change. Then they start to trust me, and know that whenever I hide a number it doesn't last long and my intent is never to cheat on them. Because it never is, I uphold the same rules when they apply against characters that I'm controlling anyway, so there they can se the fairness in the process. I'm doing my best to be impartial, and it shows, they can tell. <br/><br/>So it's easier for them to accept whenever I ask these jumps of faith. They do appreciate the uncertainty as part of the experience, otherwise I wouldn't do this at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454695/#Comment_454695" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T00:27:14+00:00" title="July  6, 2016 12:27AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2016 12:29AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always thought it might be fun to try a known target number and a known character ability/effort value (whether static or rolled) and an unknown uncertainty value (rolled if unknown to all, set if known to GM).

Why is this important? The players have cool ideas, and will contribute fun stuff to your game. If the GM or the game system is providing both the positive and the negative stakes of any given resolution, it's effectively like it's just the GM playing the game, with a randomizer to decide which of the GM's visions is dominant. </blockquote>\nThis one goes back to the idea that intent is super useful in more improvised forms as an alternative to the gloraculous prep.<br/><br/>If there is this sandbox, the players can go to any town, start a business there, help the poor people, help the rich people, go to dungeons, try to start an army, explore the wilderness, start a thieves guild, infiltrate a castle etc... that's quite a lot of things they can do. Like I've told the story on how I had used the tables in Red Tide to make a merchant family that was being harassed by a thief? I put that in there with the thought that the party would catch the thief and get in the good graces of the merchant family. Instead they became best buds with the thief. Which was surprising and interesting and fun to me.<br/><br/>Basically it comes down to:<br/>Is "My intent is to open the desk drawer and for there to be a letter from the magician addressed to me in there."<br/>appropriate or not?<br/>If no prep, then yes, the player needs this sorta power for it to work.<br/>If prep, then what's in the desk drawer (no letter, but a treasure map caked with dark spots of dry earth) is already known. There's not even a roll needed, just open it.<br/><br/>So it's completely different types of games.<br/><br/>It's weird, but I've found myself very agential when playing with prep. Everything feels "real" and that my choices are "real".<br/><br/>It boils down to: do you want to tell a story together, or do you want to visit another world together?<br/>Both very worthwhile and interesting and good things but very, very different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454714/#Comment_454714" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T06:29:53+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  6:29AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed. Except that you can't possibly prep *everything*, and in whatever lacunae in your game you're improvising (or the prep doesn't answer *those* specific questions), all the same principles apply.<br/><br/>Also, it sounds like you're an excellent GM, and you're aware of all this stuff. Most people aren't and don't bother to fix it - they can really improve when there is systemic support for player empowerment.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's less about moments of resolution and more about the ability to contribute to the fiction. If we're looking for papers in a safe, the prep will cover that. But sometimes that moment of the player going, "Oh, but I'm guessing that the Duke has love letters somewhere in his bedroom, too - and those could help us track down the King's cousin..." and the GM going, "Oh, man! I never thought of that... but yes, absolutely! It makes perfect sense..." is such a powerful and transformative thing. And that's purely because more minds had a chance to make input into the game's potential future states. <br/><br/>If a GM starts unconsciously railroading stuff, not because they're a tyrant, but rather because they're tried and they've got themselves into a rut, that's when this stuff can really blow the lid off and open up new directions for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454716/#Comment_454716" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T06:59:58+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  6:59AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the situation where there's a lot of gaps is radically different from the situation where the gaps are a rare thing.<br/>If there's a lot of gaps, then hell yes put some player intent in there!<br/>If gaps are a rare thing, do the opposite: make it "feel the same" as if there was no gap by using some general but DM facing random procedure.

In my case the biggest thing I had to sacrifice was Control. I had become a manipulative control freak, I had to prepare for every possible player reaction and prepare how to present and frame scenes to obtain a limited amount of reactions. I had to prepare tons of quality material every week in this fashion, and I actually managed to do so, until I became my own employer besides working 40 hours a week for someone else and coming up with my own comics ideas. I was a mess and it showed on the sessions. <br/><br/>I started using online random generators, which ruined some of the fun by being so generic. My impro skills got us going but the quality wasn't any close to what I had made in the past. And by then I was already nauseated at my old railroading style. I got burned out.<br/><br/>And then my players saved me. <br/><br/>At the middle of a tasteless randomly generated dungeon, I improvised a painting depicting a story of how the cult that owned the dungeon came to be, inspired by the figure of a prominent villain. One of the players got inspired by this and said jokingly "You know, we should start our own religion". And instead of saying no and try to fix the campaign by myself, I reached to that idea like a half-drown GM would reach a floating log in the middle of a river. I helped them, improvised rules about convincing people, they got excited and started to throw suggestions that I implemented the best I could. They never finished the dungeon, they had already found the most valuable treasure there: a bit of player agency. And unknowingly they had defeated the worst enemy ever: GM boredom.<br/><br/>That re-ignited my imagination: this time I was really thinking about how would the setting react to their efforts (I had tried before but to no avail) then I hacked microscope and instead of writing alone and finally revealing them how the mysterious past of the setting came to be, we all made it together as we played and it was like magic, it was one of the best scenes we've ever played.<br/><br/>Since then I've been trying other hacks and trying different experiments, which now use a lot of witch-mountain trick but wi the lowest pressure possible for the players. And the key is that whatever they come up with first, I always say yes and built upon it on the spot. I might veto some stuff if someone else in the group finds it offensive or distasteful, though often I just give it a twist to make it politically correct and healthy fun. <br/><br/>Using whatever the players throw at you from the start works as the best reward possible and triggers a chain reaction in the group: suddenly they realize that anything goes, that no idea is a bad idea, and they start to edit and come up with better material themselves. It's instantaneous. That's usually the moment where a group of skeptical strangers lost themselves into the game and shy people relax. I've even been able to notice the changes in their postures and the look in their eyes. They stop judging and start thinking, they stop being afraid and distrustful, they go as weird as they can and then all my work is to point the unconsistencies, offer suggestions and make reasonable/assertive anything they drop into the collective fiction with doubt and insecurity.<br/><br/>For me it means that I can totally walk into a session with nothing prepped, not even a campaign, confident that it will go allright. Or that I can prep loose bits to incorporate where needed. After that I can keep adding stuff to make the campaign longer either by myself or with the help of the players, or I can keep things short and end it in two hours. Well, usually it's more like I have to try hard to crontrol myself to not add stuff because it's way too easy to let yourself go and keep inventing things. <br/><br/>There's always a price to pay, but that doesn't mean you can't learn to love how you end up doing things after that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454773/#Comment_454773" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T23:14:39+00:00" title="July  7, 2016 11:14PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know if this is relevant anymore, but I just thought of a much simpler way to expres my point about Stakes and Intent, earlier. Assume some kind of basic game with a succeed/fail resolution process.<br/><br/>1. When Intent is not (necessarily) taken into account:<br/><br/>* On a success, the GM's idea happens. (Of what a success looks like/does.)<br/>* On a failure, the GM's idea happens. <br/><br/>2. When Intent is taken account, or the player is allowed to simply state it:<br/><br/>* On a success, the player's idea happens. (Of what this particular success looks like/does.)<br/>* On a failure, the GM's idea happens.<br/><br/>The difference can be subtle, and disappear almost completely when the player and the GM are completely in agreement on what a particular roll is about. (I think this why you don't need overt Intent most of the time in a D&amp;D adventure module - the purpose of rolls is generally quite clear.*) <br/><br/>However! Over the long term, over many many repetitions... this difference is HUGE and makes itself felt with wide-spread ramifications throughout the game/campaign.<br/><br/><br/>*: And at other times, you're "exploring" or puzzle-solving rather than resolving conflicts of interest, and there it's not appropriate at all. Imagine playing a puzzle like this: "I'm going to roll to see if I can reach that lever and pull it down." "Why?" "Oh, because I want the lever to deactivate the death trap and let us out." "Ok, go!" No fun at all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454786/#Comment_454786" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T05:50:45+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  5:50AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That footnote is exactly my feeling about this, Paul!<br/>To me it goes against both frotz and blorb but seems very powerful for nitfol.<br/>Frotz: we want to survive the death trap on our own<br/>Blorb: we want to see what happens when we pull the level, we're curious<br/>Nitfol: it's perfectly in line with my character and the game's tone for me to find and use such a lever<br/><br/>Yesterday there where high fives and cheering after they defeated the enemies that had killed their last characters.

All players were now the kings of the ancient technomagic kingsdoms of earth, got the permission to invent whatever weapons/technology they want and then the first scene was each of them alone facing a dimensional invasion in realtime. I made the aliens able to disregard most physical known laws, so it was clear that their technology wasn't all applicable despite their advancement. Then we had a virtual conference between all, and finally all their decisions were narrated disregarding the time they took. All players got to narrate how the king they played died and what did they left for future generations.

They want to know if it's rope you're climbing with because if you fail maybe the rope gets broken! They want to know if you're climbing slowly and carefully because maybe monsters come and eat you!<br/><br/>Possible (and, honestly, in AW probable) failure is one of the reasons why it's super important to know how and what exactly you are doing.<br/></blockquote>\nPeople seem to have moved on past the Apocalypse World "teeth" discussion, but it seems to me that A*W is toothier than you are all describing.<br/><br/>Realize that there is <i>no way to mark experience</i> unless you engage the moves--specifically, a move that uses one of your core characteristics that has been highlighted by another player.<br/><br/>Sure, you could play without engaging most of the moves, but then you'd never advance your character.

I didn't realize we were talking about AW. Are we?<br/><br/>I DO think that AW presents a neat solution to the issue of Intent, from a different angle: the codified moves allow us all to know, in advance, what stakes are in play. Then, we can choose the moves which suit our interests and proceed from there. The same objective (clarity of Intent) is achieved without us having to (usually) discuss it at the table, because it's built into the rules.<br/><br/>Airk,<br/><br/>You're quite right! There's a problem there with the available scope for intentions, and that's going to cause trouble in just about any game.<br/><br/>Your example about climbing the statue, though, is a *perfect* example for why clarifying Intent can be really important in any game at all. Being more clear about our communication gives people a much better chance of bringing up relevant details and relevant information for decision-making.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of groups fall into a habit of hiding Intent (so as to catch each other off-guard, presumably?), and they often end up having to "retcon" stuff like this.

You're right! <br/><br/>You really are right, though. You're talking about the toothiness of IIEE and I'm talking about the toothiness of Apocalypse World's reward system as it relates to making the rest of the game work. <br/><br/>People were just saying that you could play A*W without engaging any of the moves, therefore it didn't seem very toothy, and my gut reaction was 'WUT?!"<br/><br/>The brilliance of Vincent's A*W mechanical system is "To do it, do it." You have to engage with both the fiction and the move at the same time. If you really try, you can just mechanically use moves, but it's a bit weird and often the MC has to stop you and really ask "What are you doing here? How?" to understand if you're using the right move. It reinforces itself. <br/><br/>You might Initiate, but to pick the right move, you need to understand Intent, so occasionally there's a rewind there for clarification. Execution usually starts when you read the move and literally execute it like it's a computer program: "When you read a charged situation, roll+sharp." The "When" part is Initiation. The stuff after the comma is Execution. Then there's usually a bit for Effect, right? "On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. Whenever you act on one of the MC\u2019s answers, take +1. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7\u20139, ask 1..."<br/><br/>My point about highlighting stats is that players care about advancement, and this makes the game work with the moves, makes the players USE the moves instead of just role-playing and doing everything by fiat. To advance, you have to use your highlighted stats. To use highlighted stats, you have to use moves that use those stats. To use a move, you have to agree with the rest of the table that the move agrees with the fictional positioning in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455027/#Comment_455027" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-11T17:17:55+00:00" title="July 11, 2016  5:17PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2016 5:27PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You might Initiate, but to pick the right move, you need to understand Intent</blockquote>A great example of how a stake-setting or intent-clarifying conversation isn't always necessary.  If there's a mechanical option on the sheet that says "I wanna get past this guy", then when you pick it, no further discussion is needed.  AW's moves have a good deal of that, while also sounding a bit like familiar tasks/actions.  I think it's a nice middle ground (though I think any claims that it mandates extreme detail -- <i>exactly</i> what you want, <i>exactly</i> what you're doing -- are overstated).<br/><br/>I wonder if it would be possible to chop the sort of play <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> likes best, or the way I play Delve, or other very fiction-first styles, into a list of moves which clarify the relevant intents, complete with components (outcome lists? modifiers?) which necessitate a strong degree of "how".
