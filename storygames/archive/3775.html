That said, there's a lot of wisdom in Andy's comments, and changing the rules mid-stream correctly is perhaps "advanced" playtesting.

John/Jenskot's advice covers most of what I would say. I've got only a few additions:<br><br>You should very carefully watch your players during the playtest (don't stare at them or anything, just watch them). What trips them up? What confuses them? What do they dislike? What makes them uncomfortable? You'll be able to read these things from their facial expressions. Make a note of it if necessary.<br><br>Also! Do they use any little tricks to make the rules work/work better? Do you? Do they have a little pow wow about what they're going to do before they break into the "real" game? Are you drawing little maps of relationships? Etc. These are techniques they are developing in order to play your game. You should think about these techniques and how they work. Maybe they belong in the text of your game!<br><br>I'm with Andy about not changing your rules midstream in a session, unless you've specifically gone into a session with the intention of using two different versions of a rule to see the difference they make. Otherwise, it's too easy to make a change while playing and then forget, never putting it into your text. It is very easy to think that you've changed a rule that way, but never get it into the finished text.<br/><br/>Finally, if you are still developing the game while you are playtesting (which is fine for in-house playtesting, and not good once you've moved on to blind outside playtesting), go into each playtest session with a plan! Identify and flag problem areas in the rules, rules that you are uncertain about, and rules that you are uncertain are expressed clearly, and strive to bring them into play organically.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84771/#Comment_84771" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T13:30:37+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  1:30PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more thing which I think has already been mentioned a couple times but bears repeating: Don't answer questions about how something works and don't assume you know how something is going to work.

Thanks so much! So here's an overview of what I've gleaned so far.\n<blockquote>Gratitude: Repay the favor the playtesters are granting. I'm gonna treat 'em to a fancy dinner, after which we'll debrief for a little bit.<br/><br/>Margins: Leave some space in the manuscript for notes.<br/><br/>Consistency: Use the same set of rules from beginning to end, for various reasons including giving the full system a run-through as-is to find any sift the wheat from the chafe.<br/><br/>Awareness: Note everything that happens somehow, some way, as long as it's everything. I'll probably tape the session itself, taking notes of visual cues and player engagement. During the debriefing, I'll take more mechanical notes.<br/><br/>Shut up: Let the players talk. If they have a question, refer to the manuscript. <br/><br/>Set a Goal: Look out for specific problems when you're going in so you have a metric against which to measure whether the playtest was successful and productive.</blockquote>\nIs there a particular way I ought to format the manuscript aside for leaving plenty of room for notes? If I have questions on a specific part, should I write that in the manuscript or wait for the questions to arise on their own?<br/><br/>Considering that this is the first playtest for this game, what are some reasonable goals and expectations? I <i>expect</i> it to pretty much crap out, but to have some very useful data come from the 'splosion. I'm rather keen to see how well the players are able to use the letters as a source of inspiration for world-building and scene-framing via Jason's index card techniques. Also interested in seeing how <i>long</i> the session is as a whole. Whether it's reasonable to expect a session to focus on one world or several.<br/><br/>Finally, I've playtested board games with these guys a couple times. One of them is a former roommate who was a frequent guinea pig for my various abstract strategy concepts. Still, they're mostly traditional D&amp;D players. Hackmaster, of all things. They're open to new games though, so what can I do to elicit the most useful feedback? How do I distinguish subjective player tastes from objective problems/highlights of the system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84862/#Comment_84862" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T20:41:36+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  8:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Is there a particular way I ought to format the manuscript aside for leaving plenty of room for notes?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I like to double-space, and use normal margins on one sie, but a quite wide (ca. 2 inches) margin on the other; it inflates your page count like nobody's business, but the big white column is really good for the slightly longer notes you may need to make.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84864/#Comment_84864" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T21:02:59+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  9:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            shreyas' format sounds great.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm leery of putting questions in the text. It's likely to cause the playtesters to focus on that area more for good or ill; they won't take the same organic approach to that portion of the rules that they otherwise would have.<br/><br/>You should invite them to write down their comments and make sure to pay attention to anything they write. However, I think you'll find that the most useful information will come from watching them and how they interact with the rules. If they do something interesting or puzzling though, make sure to ask them about it, what they were thinking or feeling, etc.<br/><br/>Because it's a playtest, they will almost surely offer you rules suggestions and tweaks. Listen to what they have to say, but remember that nobody but you has a better idea of the big picture that you are trying to capture. Ideas are great, but keep some perspective. Even a really neat idea that seems killer at the time may not be suitable for your vision. What you're really looking for are areas where the mechanics are not achieving your vision. You can attack the problem later.<br/><br/>Finally, make sure to warn them ahead of time that they're not going to be having regular RPG-fun. If they're gearheads, they may enjoy it immensely. But on the whole, playtesting, especially early playtesting, can be frustrating and even tedious.<br/><br/>You'll probably want to stop at some points and talk about what's going wrong while it's fresh. Inevitably, someone is going to get annoyed with delays and try to push the game along. That's fine with a normal game, but doesn't work for a playtest. They're going to have to be patient with you and the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84898/#Comment_84898" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T04:50:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  4:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I don't see on your list is managing expectations - communicate what you want and what you expect (good and bad) to your testers.

If a player identifies an issue or has a concern, <i>I want to know about it right there, right then</i>.  I want to know how they feel about the situation they are in while they are in it, not what they think about it in hindsight.  Actually, yes, I want to hear what they thought about it in hindsight too, but not instead of.<br/><br/>These breaks will happen less and less in later playtests as the game starts to work better.  In the early stages though, there are a lot of kinks to work out and I like to stop when I reach one, drag the problem kicking and screaming into the light and examine it right away.

We hung out for about fifteen minutes prior and for a couple hours afterwards. The playtesters gave some intensely directed and well-reasoned ideas for revisions, refinements and even phrasing. They pointed out unexpected cool things the system did, as well as the stumbling blocks and straight-up dead ends. Regardless, we played the system as-is, seeing where it took us. I shut up as much as I could, hoping to elicit more comments from the group than myself.

To kick things off, here's the playtest document for version 1.0 of the rules, warts and all.\n<h1>The Document</h1>\n<a href="http://www.danielsolis.com/do/playtest/Do_Playtest_v1.zip" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple<br/>Playtest Document v 1.0</a><br/><br/>The bulk of this material was written, much like this post, early in the morning before Shannon has woken up for our morning run. It was finally compiled into a semi-coherent form at the 11th hour on the day before playtest. The stream-of-consciousness writing combined with some last-minute changes to make the text actually logical produced some unfortunate stumbling blocks in play.<br/><br/>Also note that's why the character sheet is such a slap-dash quickie job.<br/><br/>Thankfully, all of this was clear enough to be playable, despite a few hang-ups.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack<br/>I assembled this playlist from the soundtracks of the .hack// and Kingdom Hearts video game franchises. I found them to be evocative enough to set a mood but not so intrusive they are counter to any particular segment of the story. Video game music is designed to fit into an asynchronous storyline with an unpredictable length of time spent on any particular section of the narrative. Very fitting for a tabletop game, I thought. This is the first time I put the hypothesis to the test.<br/><br/>Character Creation<br/>The following are transcribed comments and notes directly from the recorded character creation session.<br/><br/>Here are scans of the completed character sheets.<br/><br/>Charlie notes how the temple is really the only fixed point in the universe, both in terms of cosmology and in the fiction as well.<br/><br/>Seating order: To Box's left is seated Shannon, to her left is seated Charlie, to his left is seated Daniel, to my left is seated Box.<br/><br/>Step 1: Name<br/>Make space on the character sheet for the name.<br/>Charlie asks whether the name-list is exhaustive or more of a source of inspiration. Charlie chooses a name that was not noted in the list.<br/>Box is playing Flood Well<br/>Shannon is playing Cheerful Orchard<br/>Charlie is playing Dutiful Floor<br/>Daniel is playing Jaunty Lotus<br/><br/>Step 2: Memories<br/>Make space on the character sheet for the anecdotes.<br/>This game works best for four players, not three.<br/>When you're writing the anecdote, should use the character's pilgrim name or some pre-pilgrimage surname that we should use.<br/>Writing the second and third anecdote is interesting because you don't want to contradict previous anecdotes, but it also gives you some more guidance in terms of the character's established personality.<br/>It's a fun role-playing challenge to play a character you did not make.<br/>Include a part where everyone reads aloud the anecdote they wrote about each other's characters, right after it was written. This gives an opportunity to correct any grammar issues in the anecdotes.<br/><br/>Step 3: Details<br/>Make space on the character sheet for the Details.<br/>Charlie asks whether the sensory details are literal. "How does the character taste?"<br/>Drawing from the anecdotes for the details is tricky.<br/>In the service of getting <i>something</i> completely playable for the playtest, some parts are lifted wholesale from other games such as 1001 Nights for the Detail examples and inSpectres for the number of Details. <br/>Foreshadowing of further difficulties in Step 4<br/><br/>Step 4: Traits<br/> Make space on the character sheet for the Traits.<br/>This whole section needs an overhaul. Not coincidentally, it's the one that was most rushed through in writing.<br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Even if</span> ESPECIALLY if your game has DIY traits, you need to include an exhaustive list of examples.<br/>The color wheel diagram got confused with the Way of Ways diagram on the character sheet, which persisted in further confusion in gameplay. However, this also brings up the question of the necessity for a split between Trait and Way since the game was still technically playable.<br/>Including a summary of the whole character creation process up front would be useful so that there isn't this confusion. Or, perhaps, character creation should be simplified. Perhaps a little of both.<br/>Make it clear that a trait is six words and there are six traits that you create, but traits can be a sentence or phrase. Shannon tried stringing together six adjectives, which was really hard. 6x6 adjectives. Ouch. She was afraid that she would need to break out the thesaurus.<br/>The lack of examples was a major mistake. One primarily due to time constraints, but nevertheless one that should have been avoided. All the previous steps were clearly and efficiently executed. All previous steps have at least <i>some</i> examples.<br/>Players didn't know whether the traits were just strings of six thematically related words, or phrases, or DBZ-style powers, or a pre-made list of more traditional skills.<br/>Are the traits necessary? (Foreshadowing in further mechanical notes.)<br/>The trait-simplification over time should be explained here, even though it's relevant to the endgame mechanics.<br/>Easier method of trait creation: Underline six-word sections of the anecdotes or, if too long or not long enough, underline a section and rephrase it so it's six words.<br/>Shannon notes that because character creation is such a group activity, there might be peer pressure to not stay on-world or return to the temple.<br/>The significance of primary vs. secondary colors is not clear.<br/><br/>Step 5: The Way of Ways<br/>Explain the setting-significance of The Way of Ways.<br/>This is a welcome return to easy character creation process from steps 1 and 2.<br/>Revise the significance of white and black beads so they're not a good/bad dichotomy.<br/>Also note the endgame "victory" conditions at this point or earlier so that players keep this in mind as they distribute their tokens.<br/><br/>Total character creation time for four players, including the problems in step 4: About an hour.<br/><br/>Conclusions<br/>Consider removing step 3 and merging step 4 and 5. Remove Balance from the Way of Ways and let players choose which Way is assigned to a particular color. Players said the anecdotes were still useful as a role-play aid and to loosen up creatively, so keep that part. Later gameplay shows a lack of relevance for the split between Trait and Way, so when you create a Trait, go ahead and assign it to a color, too. When you do something, the relevant attribute is the Way you do it, but if you need further inspiration for describing your character's action, you can look at the associated trait as well.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85824/#Comment_85824" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T11:34:14+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 11:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Even if</span>ESPECIALLY if your game has DIY traits, you need to include an exhaustive list of examples.</blockquote>\nALWAYS good advice.

Hard isn't necessarily un-fun, but some of us need a little more help. So I wanted to have a baby-steps process to loosen people up and get the juices flowing a bit. Start off with just picking two words from a list or <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Pilgrim_Names" rel="nofollow">randomly generate</a> them. Then pass this sheet to your left, write a bit about this character's courage. Pass to the left, write about their wisdom. Pass to the left, and write about their power.

I'll be the guy with a pouch of beads instead of dice and a stack of blank index cards. ^_^<br/>I'm in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86542/#Comment_86542" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T11:05:14+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 11:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 11:05AM by DanielSolis.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Andy!

This scene only took about fifteen minutes. Still a little long, but the problems feel smoother and more manageable with some social guidance rather than mechanical overhaul.<br/><br/>I gotta rearrange and more clearly explain the order of resolution. There's a lot of creative pressure on the sifu when there is a successful action but unresolved conflict. He has explain how the action didn't succeed, pick another conflict symbol, then ask another question that presents an actionable conflict for the student. Including permission in the rules for the chorus to make suggestions would be good. Shannon had been avoiding making suggestions since she didn't want to be "that guy" from her D&amp;D days.<br/><br/>I noticed Flood Well's last action didn't specifically address Dutiful Floor's question. Is this a bug or a feature? Does this mean that the question is unnecessary? Seems like it'd help so the student would have some prompting for an action. Should all the non-student players offer suggestions (in some ritualized way, as in Baron Munchausen or 1001 Nights) rather than put the sifu on the spot? </blockquote>\nI must say that while transcribing notes from audio tape is a painstaking process, I am getting bountiful amounts of feedback that I would have otherwise missed in hastily written notes or from memory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87194/#Comment_87194" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T02:22:06+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  2:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like a dork when I have two posts right after each other, but <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/600519.html" rel="nofollow">here's the last bit of notes</a> transcribed from the tapes. The last two scenes pretty much re-tread the same problems and suggestions as the first two, so these are some looser notes plus some thoughts on integrating the endgame mechanics earlier and more deeply into the system.<br/><br/>Many thanks to those who've slogged through all those random, out-of-context notes and offered feedback and suggestions. I am so glad I ran a playtest before GenCon. I have a feeling that in a few months, I'll be able to point to this first playtest like a "Before" picture in a weight loss success story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
