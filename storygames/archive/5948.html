I mentioned that I've been playing on-line for several years now. I also posted our <a href="http://bluedevilgames.com/eWerewolf.zip" rel="nofollow">rules and roles</a>.<br/><br/>We're planning on starting a new game on Monday 3/17. We play on-line via Google Groups. So, you would need to be willing and able to join Google Groups. You would need to be "available" that week from roughly 10 AM EST to 5 PM EST. Now, by available, you do <b>not</b> need to chain yourself to your computer the entire time. You just need to be able to access Google Groups (or post/respond via e-mail) several times during the day. If you've got a desk job that you can periodically surf, you'll be fine. If you work for a logging company and will be in the middle of the woods, not so much. If you're mostly good but have one day you think will be bad, it won't be a problem.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's fun. If you're interested, just let me know. Whisper your e-mail address to me. Of course, if you have questions, I'm happy to answer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132917/#Comment_132917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T09:03:12+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ack, bad week for me...
