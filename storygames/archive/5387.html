Including all of the regulars that have been in our play group for the past two and a half years we have:<br/><br/>Trad<br/>1. Someone who pretty much only plays games that take place in Tolkeinesque fantasy settings and has only ever (as far as I know) played D&amp;D. The game he runs tend to play like a game of multiplayer Diablo.<br/>2. Someone whose style of GMing/houserule making is Gygaxian (in the best possible way). Is up for playing most anything and loves making up his own spells/classes/whatever for his characters which (wonder of wonders) tend to be distinctly underpowered. Loves his fiddly bits (yes, I know that sounds so very wrong).<br/>3. Someone who goes along with whatever he thinks the GM wants and tries to be a good team player. <br/>4. Someone who is big and likes to shout and plays characters who are big and like to shout. Never bothers to learn any system too well.<br/>5. Someone who is a bit neurotic and plays characters who are neurotic and like to burn things. Generally learns the system pretty well, avoids powergaming but makes sure that his character is capable of burning a lot of things.<br/>6. Someone whose only constant in play is that he always ends up with the mechanically weakest character in the group, no matter what. Never GMs and is up for playing pretty much anything. Hasn't got a chance to play any Indie games.<br/>7. Someone who loves WoD and is the only player I've ever seen who manages to consistently end SotC sessions with a stack of fate points left. I have no idea how he manages that. <br/>8. Someone who loves WoD and the idea of roleplaying (in practice he's more of a spotlight hog than anything else). Tends to have a weak grasp of the rules and in general doesn't think that mechanics matter much, likes handwaving things. Ran an awesome Ravenloft campaign in which Murphey's Law was VERY strictly enforced with hilarious results and the rest of his campaigns lasted exactly one session.<br/>9. Someone who likes playing games that are different. GMs a mix of very old and very new games.<br/>10. Someone who was always quiet and a sort of "tell me when it's my turn and I'll role the dice" sort of player. Has become much more active and is roleplaying much more since being introduced to SotC.<br/>11. Someone who DLed Fate for some reason, read through it and thought it was awesome and started telling everyone how awesome it was. Then he read the SotC SRD when it came out and thought it was awesome and started telling everyone how awesome it was. He now GMs a SotC campaign usually by the seat of his pants so it's a bit scattered but a lot of fun.<br/>12. Someone who used to be sort of the group's resident Brian (see Knights of the Dinner Table) and the one who knew what far too many Feats and PrCs did. Decided that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2311&amp;Mode=like">#11</a> was right in his talk of the awesome and started to memorize Forge terminology instead of Feat lists. Is the only member of the group whose read much of any RPG theory or anything by Ron Edwards. Crappy storyteller as a GM, but does an OK job of creating a world in which the PCs can tear to pieces while he sits back and enjoys the fun without attempting to direct the course of the story very much.<br/>Indie<br/><br/>1, 2, 11 and 12 are the most active/long-term/core members of the group, which is slowly morphing from D&amp;D with a bit of WoD into about half and half D&amp;D and Storygames with a bit of WoD thrown in as an occasional one-off. I like the way things are going <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What sort of spectrum do the rest of you have?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120868/#Comment_120868" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T00:27:31+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 12:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indie * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Simon * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Trad<br/><br/>Indie * * * * * * * * * Graham * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * Trad<br/><br/>Indie * * * * Steve * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * Trad<br/><br/>Indie * * * * Alex* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * Trad<br/><br/>Indie * *  * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * *Dave * * * * *  * * Trad<br/><br/>Indie * *  * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *WK* *  Trad                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120869/#Comment_120869" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T00:40:11+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 12:40AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously?<br/><br/>You're asking this seriously?<br/><br/>I mean, for serious?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120872/#Comment_120872" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T02:01:27+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think he is, indeed, asking this seriously, and why not?<br/><br/>Anyway I play regularly with a group of 3 others, who are a subset of around 6 friends who have cycled through a series of campaigns together using Trad systems (GURPS, Ars Magica, L5R). (All names are filed off but I appologise to anyone who recongises themselves. I hope I am not saying anything you'd disagree with!)<br/><br/>One is a very firm Trad player, with the emphasis on character immersion and backstory. She is unsatisfied playing characters for a short period, she wants to know their life story, play them for years, commission their character art, investigate their family, develop relationships and the like. She is the co-operate with the GM style of player who wants to be challenged but is not a story hog. She thinks story games are Asshattery <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Player two is more gamist. She doesn't want her character to fail and will avoid situations where it's likely (or think up a flangy way out of trouble). System matters little to her, we could change rule sets mid campaign and I don't think it would bother her as long as she didn't have to re-write her character sheet herself. I don't think she has tried any story / GM-less / single-session games, but I imagine she would like some of them.<br/><br/>Player three is a wargamer, who shares player one's like of complex character backstory, but likes a good fight with miniatures as well. He *also* likes to take on minor characters, contribute colour, help with NPC's and the like, which makes me think that some story games would be right up his street. I intend to try In a Wicked Age on him.<br/><br/>Player four has played far more story games than I ever have, and I know he loves one session pick up and play stuff as much as he does longer things (or more, since he is always busy). On the other hand he doesn't have the slightest time for rules and never learns any.<br/><br/>Player five hasn't, to my knowledge, tried any story games (except a Solipsist playtest), but certainly values story over rules (which he likens to the numbers in computer games, enticing but pointless). He would be all up for games which would let him frame scenes, I think.<br/><br/>Player six (who is me) mostly runs games instead of playing in them (this is why I liked Shock this weekend, we were all playing *and* GM'ing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>. I like traditional games with cruchy rules and miniatures, and I like these weirdy story games as well, so I'd put myself in the middle somewhere at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120939/#Comment_120939" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T08:54:04+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  8:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't even know what you mean by 'indie/trad spectrum', it doesn't make any sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120945/#Comment_120945" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T09:27:54+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  9:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking where my players fall in all the groups and stuff I have.<br/><br/>However, it turns out that I really can't pin them down.  One or two might be more into traditional games and stuff, but it turns out they play anything that looks fun, across any spectrum: Hippy, "trad", board game, video game, and so on.
