Reception has been fairly positive, however I wanted to touch base with some of the designers here and get there take on something that's always bothered me.<br/><br/>Quick Note: I run a Tabletop group down here in Charleston, SC in the US. Almost everyone who shows up is a new role-player, and we have different people every week. So I basically end up running one-shots and con-games every week. Because of this, I've started evaluating systems on how easily a system can be explained, how long character creation takes, and whether the game is satisfying to play without any advancement.<br/><br/>DnD, for example, is a lot of fun, but doesn't work very well for one-shots. A lot of the system relies on in-depth character creation (2-3 hours at least) and advancement (leveling up, getting better weapons, etc). I've been mostly using Dungeon World, since character creation is quick, and the system is simple. But even Dungeon world relies on advancement and gaining stronger abilities.<br/><br/>To that end, Mythic Mortals is my attempt to solve a lot of these problems:<br/><br/>* The rules are written to be read aloud, explaining the game and the mechanics in just a few minutes. These rules also walk the players through character creation.<br/>* Players start out with all of their powers, weapons and abilities; however which abilities are currently active changes and fluctuates as the game moves forward.<br/>* Players must try to combine their weapons, powers and benefits in a way that best fits their current situation.<br/><br/>In practice, Mythic Mortals has been a lot of fun to jump in and play for a short time, and will hopefully inspire more games suited to one-shots and short campaigns.<br/><br/>What do you think? Is there a better way to solve this problem? Is it even a problem?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444524/#Comment_444524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T16:17:46+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  4:17PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            /sub                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444557/#Comment_444557" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T19:04:21+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  7:04PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks great, David! Congrats on your release!<br/><br/><a href="http://schirduans.com/david/my-creations/mythic-mortals" rel="nofollow">Mythic Mortals</a> looks great. I will read it in depth later, but I think it will successfully address these issues you're having. <br/><br/>Among friends, we came up with the term <i>one-off syndrome</i>, which designates a medical condition of collective debilitation when roleplaying a one-off, or even a session in a campaign after a long break (due to school breaks or exams for instance). Even if such sessions were carefully prepared or the system was well-known, there would be arcade play. <br/><br/>It's maybe not exactly what you mean, but I'm sure a game like Mythic Mortals will be very convenient for one-offs. Also a nice touch in this regard are the included adventures. Looking forward to reading more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449054/#Comment_449054" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-16T05:51:05+00:00" title="October 16, 2015  5:51AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mythic Mortals</b> funded on Kickstarter <i>in under 12 hours!</i>  Let's help David hit those stretch goals:<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/464972563/mythic-mortals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/464972563/mythic-mortals</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449058/#Comment_449058" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-16T10:59:38+00:00" title="October 16, 2015 10:59AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooh, backed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449277/#Comment_449277" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-05T04:29:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2015  4:29AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I've been keeping a sly eye on mythic mortals when I first stumbled on it on your site David. Now, after a couple months hiatus I come to find it's got a kickstarter! It's funded?! And there's a zeroprep packet out?!  Take a little time off and miss all the good stuff. At any rate, just wanted to let you know, game looks badass my friend.  Very cool.<br/><br/>Now, for anyone else reading this, I'm gonna give Mythic Mortals a spin with some folk this Saturday on roll20. So if you're interested to try it out and haven't been able to, message me as I got one spot left.  Basic premise: Players are going to be Silver Age super heroes fighting Silver Age menaces.  I know, this is not how the game is presented, but it's what I immediately thought of while reading the ZeroPrep packet.  At any rate, I'll update you folk on how it runs.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan" title="DavidSchirduan"><img alt="DavidSchirduan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan">DavidSchirduan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449279/#Comment_449279" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-05T14:55:26+00:00" title="November  5, 2015  2:55PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Luzelli! <br/><br/>It's been a wild ride, but I'm excited for the opportunity to put out a polished, crisp clean version.
