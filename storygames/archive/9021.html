But after checking them out I thought it'd be fun to have a thread for folks to comment on your FAVORITE before the judging.  Please post your favorite(s) and why.  <br/><br/>For me this will help me see anything I missed in reading so many of the entries...  Or consider why something might be more fun than I interpreted...  It also might be a good place for the authors to give their  "DVD-commentary".  Let's just try not to get bogged down replying about any single game.<br/><br/><br/>The great thing about these Little Game Chef challenges is how quick and simple the games turn out.  I can read through a full game in TWO PAGES.  In fact I can glance at the pages and skim each to see if it CATCHES my attention to dig into.<br/><br/>I had two favorites that JUMPED out at me from the many entries.  I haven't played either yet (obviously) but I can see that they're definitely games I'd like to try.  So here's my somewhat uninformed reviews.  I like reviewing (and being reviewed) as I ask my players to review each game session in our weekly email group - a "GOOD / BAD / UGLY" style.  So here's mine:<br/><br/><br/>Thanks<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199406/#Comment_199406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T22:34:22+00:00" title="March 29, 2009 10:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2009 10:59PM by kevperrine.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>PLATO'S CHARIOT</b></span><br/><br/><br/><b>GOODS</b><br/>I love games that pull me in with an immersion quality.  PLATO'S CHARIOT does this for me by giving all the game rules - "invisibly" mingled in with the theme, story, style and plot of the game.  Explaining how to play the game through speaking to the player AND player character at the same time.  <br/><br/>Another indie game that I found a couple years ago that did this in a similar way was "Sputnik Lost".  Like that game PLATO'S CHARIOT drew me into the context of the world of the game, at the same time giving me the rules for the game.  Setting the rules as in-game narrative.   I've seen some games that try to set the rules into the narrative go a little too far though.  I like my role-play a great deal, but I also like the GAME aspect of RP"G"s -  I'm not a huge fan of extremely narrative games... I need a little bit of crunch.  Both games provide this aspect by also being the "character sheet" and/or "record sheet" for the game - AGAIN all in context of the two-page narrative!<br/><br/>PLATO'S CHARIOT also integrates the "adventure" into the narrative/rules pages, again - similar to Sputnik Lost, however PLATO'S CHARIOT does so even more strongly by using the complete second page as an in-game form that asks the "supervisor"  (Game Master) to fill in a "service log" where the "data" has been corrupted.  This "corrupted" missing info is where the story of YOUR game group takes place with just enough of (what I call) benchmarks to aid the GM in developing how the PLATO'S CHARIOT would generally begin.  Here's something I love.  I could see "adventures" being "released" as additional single page "supervisor logs" with similar "missing" information!<br/><br/>I have not yet absorbed exactly how I feel the rules may play.  I'll have to give it a test run in the future to fully give context.<br/><br/>The setting of PLATO'S CHARIOT is also interesting (and fairly unique) to me.  The "ship" on-which the players (passengers!) are on is left mostly ambiguous - which I think is wonderful.  This ship to heaven(?) could literally be translated as a dozen very different unique crafts on-which you could build the story...  I could see the ship being anything from a star-ship to a fantasy tall-ship to a metaphoric ship (a beam of light?!) or even just a simple Charon Barge  - literally anything the GM likes.  That is IF the GM cares/wants to even describe or make the ship.  I could see playing very loosely or (more my style) creating a "deck-plan" to present and enjoy.<br/><br/>The production of the two page game is also eye catching but not overly "designed".  It's simple and fits the flavor of the game - looking/reading like a form and log on the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>BADS</b><br/>Not much... really.  To be honest - I am NOT a great proof-reader or editor, so there may be editing mistakes.  But I wouldn't know.  <br/><br/>It took me two read-throughs to grok the actual rules, I simply missed the sentence noting the dice roll aspect.  I also misunderstood shifting left or right, at first I assumed the closer to the extreme represented your current state.  Again, I chalk this up to my initial quick read-through. <br/><br/>Some of the words in the text are highlighted in colors (red, blue and green).  These colors correspond to the PC's "extreme" however I'm not sure if that correspondence IS intentional and meaningful to the rules/play.  I don't think it is, but I haven't seen any notation either way.<br/><br/>Unlike the ship-setting - the "doses" of "Pale Horse" and "Dark Horse" is left a little too vague for me.  I'd like to understand the context of a "dose" to understand how this rule (and in-game thing) should be developed and used by players and the GM.<br/><br/>While I like the second page "adventure" supervisor log that gets filled out during game I am not sure I understand the timeline of the trip.  The ETA of the trip looks to be 5 hours(?) but the "clock" for the log confuses me.  This isn't a big gripe.  In fact I don't know if it even really matters.  But it seems like part of the setting flavor for WHEN things happen in the story timeline, so I'd like to understand how to read it best.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><b>UGLY</b><br/>As noted the game looks and reads well for the context and style of the game and setting.  Little ugly jumps out.<br/><br/>Regarding the second "adventure" page - I'd like to have seen the PDF created as a "form-fill" page that I (as GM/Supervisor) could easily type in the log info during game.  Some might prefer hand writing in the story - me, I'd prefer typing on my laptop as needed as we play.  Simple easy and printable at any point if a player wants to review.  My point... why not use the functionality of the PDF since it's a PDF game?<br/><br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199407/#Comment_199407" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T22:34:31+00:00" title="March 29, 2009 10:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2009 10:59PM by kevperrine.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>PEGAPOCALYPSE</b></span><br/><br/><br/><b>GOODS</b><br/>The background and premise of this game cracks me up! In the great way!  The premise text was very evocative and creative for me.  I'm a fan of taking a thing (in this case pegasi) that can sometimes be made fun of by the majority and give it a spin to make it interesting.  To give context to this point... I'm a fan of Aquaman. hehe  So for me - I really like the imagination of pegasi being doom!  <br/>To quote: \n<blockquote><i>"The apocalypse is here. People expected nuclear war or zombies, but no one expected... pegasi." </i></blockquote>\nLOL - PEGAPOCALYPSE had me with this very first sentence!  Not only is this premise fun and funny, it (to me) is really an interesting twist that could be very fun (in a cool way) to role-play through.  The detail points (bold in the quote) are both fun, funny and evocative to my mind.\n<blockquote><i>It all started with <b>Pegasus pancakes</b>- the breakfast sensation that swept the nation and then the world. Everyone knew that they were a \u201c<b>mythically delicious</b>\u201d addition to a \u201c<b>breakfast of heroes</b>\u201d but it wasn\u2019t until the pegasi burst from the stomachs of the world\u2019s people that they discovered <b>the secret ingredient- Pegasus eggs</b>! The damned pegasi had pulled off their plot perfectly, and now the world was theirs to destroy.</i></blockquote>\nI also love the image used!  I'm an old Magic the Gathering player - so the image caught me (it's from the card "Pegasus Stampede" if I remember correctly).  <br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.angellyn1.com/PGallery/Pegasus5/Images/pegasus_stampede_MarkZug.gif"/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>BADS</b><br/>The graphic design of the two page game is not good.  It's not unreadable, but it's close.  The author DID try to explain the use of the tiny font size in the set-up for the game premise...  and that's great.  <br/>However:<br/>-  the size of the font<br/>-  not using fonts to aid the design  (everything's the same serif font)<br/>-  poor leading (space between lines) <br/>-  the lack of any headings/sub-headings<br/>-  the lack of indentation<br/>-  the lack of lines between paragraphs<br/>-  the use (but not in a good way) of bold face and underline text<br/>-  the "rag-right" text (justified would have looked better with the margins)<br/>-  the large margins<br/>-  the single column<br/>ALL of this makes the text challenging to read through.  I describe this as similar to having a teacher (or presentation) talking in a extremely monotone voice.  Lack of attention to all those details in graphic design and layout make a page unfriendly to the eyes.  (see my Uglies below)<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>UGLIES</b><br/>Honestly... while I love the premise.  I (currently) have not slogged through the two page tiny monotone text to even read how the game works.  That stinks.  But that's exactly WHY I point out the "BADS".  I really really enjoyed the first long paragraph that described the premise - but I just couldn't read the read (yet).  This has alot to do with the fact I wanted to get to the NEXT entry in the Little Game Chef - I saved this game to my desktop to dig into later... but the formatting was so challenging to read it stopped me from dealing with it at first glance.<br/><br/>Because of this initial "Ugly" - I'm afraid I cannot yet review the rest of the game's rules or play points.  But... the great thing is the premise SOLD me with the first sentence, so it's on my read list for later.  When I'm able to digest it, I'll try and return with my review. <br/><br/>I have a good deal of graphic design in my background, so another UGLY for me is I want to go back and DESIGN this game's page layout!  In a way that's giving it a compliment again, but it's an ugly for me simply because I have SO many other things that I would be procrastinating on to do so.  heheh.<br/><br/>The art...  I love love love the image used (as noted in my "GOOD" above).  I'm guessing the image alone was an inspiration for the game.  That's great!  However, I would be concerned that this game couldn't really ever be marketed for sale because it would force the author to either remove the art or create a new piece.  That's "ugly" because the piece of art used is PERFECT for the imagery of the premise.  I know the author might never care or intend to take the game and make it for sale - however, I find it something that of a hindrance because I think it's a fun premise.  My bias on this may be unfair though - I generally consider anything I create could be open to a commercial product... Not in a negative way - simply because I enjoy giving back to the RPG hobby and if the game ever took off you just couldn't legally use that art.  That's too bad. <br/>The last point on the art - the author credited the artist, however as with the entire game, it could have been show/designed better.  As it is the art is only credited with the artist's name as it was on the original art - that's fine, however for such an evocative image I would have given the art a specific reference at the end of the game.  Afterall it IS from a Magic the Gathering card and that is not noted at all which, in a way, is a discredit to the authors of that card/game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199462/#Comment_199462" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T09:21:26+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  9:21AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I scanned all the games to see which ones had really rocking layout (basically, to find the main contenders for the Harper Award).  The ones that stood out for me were <i>The Mustang</i> and <i>The Midnight Project</i>, both of which were striking.  Honestly, those are the only ones I've read so far, because the layout drew me into being interested in them.<br/><br/><i>The Mustang</i>, for its part, is also a striking game, like a hyper-condensed version of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, sharing most of the same themes but boiling everything down to a single conflict between four rural denizens and a demonic, fire-breathing horse.  Reading it, I was reminded of scenes from the Michael Douglas / Val Kilmer film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_and_the_Darkness" rel="nofollow">The Ghost and the Darkness</a> (about fighting man-eating lions in Kenya).  Very cool, thematically and structurally.  My only concern is that the helpfulness of entire characters -- and, thus, potentially, the satisfaction and enjoyment of their players -- comes down to a single coin flip.  I think you can probably frame the play experience such that losing the coin flip is still really interesting and fun, but that's something I'd try to keep my eye on when playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199465/#Comment_199465" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T09:27:06+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  9:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2009 10:21AM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a weird double-post thing here, so I deleted it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199489/#Comment_199489" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T11:25:34+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 11:25AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2009 11:28AM by John_Harper.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the look of <i>Mare Caspium</i>. The layout is very nice and the graphics support the style of the game well -- especially the map, which is used as a key part of play. It also has an interesting twist on the Otherkind mechanic that I think will work well. The game has a grabby initial setup but seems well suited to ongoing play, reminiscent of <i>Poison'd</i> in that way. Hopefully I'll be able to wrangle a playtest of it soon.<br/><br/>The other game that really grabbed me was <i>Do U See</i>, the game of psychic assassins. This is definitely a game I will keep in my traveling game bag, to be thrown down when a no-prep, easy buy-in game is needed.

There were a lot of games in the competition that essentially said, "Here's a resolution mechanic, now go make up a story!" and I think that usually doesn't work. Midnight H gets away with it because, even if the rules don't tell me what the story is supposed to be like, it all comes out of the cut-ups. This is a game I would play.<br/><br/><strong>Mustang</strong> is a great little scenario, and another game I would play. I know how the mechanics work, and what the story is, and how to tell when the game is over. It also occurs to me that a playthrough of this game could probably be set to music and uploaded on YouTube.<br/><br/>I loved the setting of <strong>Descent</strong>. But with a game that is about such a specific scenario, and has only one possible ending (crushed to death), I would have liked to see specific instructions about how to tell when the game is over. I got the sense that the characters are supposed to know who cut their safety line, so a natural narrative would be to reveal this to the players by exploring the characters' back stories, but if anything in the rules enforces that, I missed it. If there was a good mechanic that focused the story and brought it to a crashing end, I would play this game.<br/><br/>I liked <strong>The Gambit of Erzulie Ga Rouge</strong>, but it feels mostly like a boardgame where combat asks the players to tell little vignettes. Take the story out, and it's still the same game. Probably a better game, since there's very little guidance given about what the vignettes are supposed to be about. Story-from-nothing is hard!<br/><br/>I was really intrigued by the setting for <strong>Midnight at Burning Horse</strong>, and I'd like to see this game fleshed out further. Specifically, I wanted more guidance as to what the story was supposed to be about. There's a neat character creation system, but little guidance on plot creation. There are a lot of cool possible plot elements: Japanese baseball! Internment camps! The Ku-Klux Klan! But what do I do with them? If this game is going to fit on one sheet of paper, I would rather have specific characters in a specific historical scenario. Since this game involves real history, and racism, I really want the designer to hold my hand and tell me what to do, because I'm not going to feel comfortable asking my friends to come play through a story with those elements I just made up. I guess I could read through the actual history of Yakima Valley and get a scenario that way, but, come on designer! That's your job! If there was a little more plot hand-holding, I would play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
