For reference, we used the 2nd edition pdf downloaded from the site on 3/5/08 and none of the players, nor I, had any prior exposure to RBH (e.g. we hadn't read any discussions of it previously so we had no additional context from online comments or questions to inform our play, other than what was in the text).<br/><br/>To preface the following, the players appeared to have fun and I enjoyed roleplaying the NPCs and providing opposition.  But there were several elements that reduced the enjoyment of the game for most of the participants.  Part was the group's inexperience with the system and what it was trying to accomplish.  Part was the fact that it had been pitched as as inspired by "Red Box" D&amp;D, but didn't appear to us to be similar enough.  And part was some dissatisfaction with the system, which seemed neither gamist enough to evoke the nostalgic / paranoid feeling of "Old-School" D&amp;D nor free enough to match with other story game favorites (e.g. PTA).<br/><br/>Just for the sake of clarity, I'm going to separate my feedback into questions on the system, suggestions on what I found effective during play, and feedback on the experience of play.<br/><br/>Personal Praise:<br/>I found some cool ideas in this game and I just wanted to notate those.<br/><br/>1. Arenas - I love the tactical interplay between these and weapons and they seem a great method to abstract away from the grid paper map and into a more conceptual space.<br/><br/>2. The Awesome Tokens, specifically the Show Off and Assist combat maneuvers are great ideas and I'd like to steal them for use in other games.<br/><br/>3. The XP award rules are cool and do help tie the game to the source material.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/>1. Healing is explained in the text on page 17, but reference is made to a "healer".  The only character class with healing ability that I recall is the Bear with its Bear Song Talent.  Is that the only character who can act as a healer?  Can NPCs perform healing?<br/><br/>2. Do you ever make rolls when using a Talent, do they work automatically, or does it vary?  For instance, the Mystic class' Conversational Spirit Talent states that they can freely converse with spirits of a place.  Do you have to engage in an Eloquence conflict to (a) contact a spirit of a place or (b) convince a recalcitrant spirit to obey your will?  Or are they assumed automatic via use of the Talent?<br/><br/>3. Can you spend Awesome tokens on other character's rolls in combat?  The fact that there is a specific assist action (which generates token on behalf of someone else) suggests the answer is no.<br/><br/>4. Can you spend Awesome tokens outside of combat, during a conflict?  Can Awesome tokens be spent in a combat on a non-attack action?  My reading of the rules is no.<br/><br/>5. Do you start the game with any Awesome tokens?  Do awesome tokens persist after a given fight ends?<br/><br/>6. When multiple characters are engaged in a conflict, where failure of one would bring the whole group trouble, it states to use the lowest "roll" (bottom page 13).  Should this be the lowest result, across each character's roll + modifier?  If not, whose modifier is applied to the 1d12 roll?<br/><br/><br/>Suggestions:<br/>1. I found it effective to break the concept of a single, unitary monster.  For example, I create an Orc Warg rider and his Warg mount as a single monster, and divided HP and powers between them.  Additionally, I created a cursed room full of undead as a single monster, with the powers and hp shared by all (e.g. any hit resulted in one or more undead being taken out, when all hp exhausted then all undead vanquished).<br/><br/>Feedback:<br/>I hesitate to call this critique of the game because it lacks a depth of thought that I feel is necessary.  But after the game, the players and I discussed it and this is largely the consensus of opinion.<br/><br/>1. The game, with it's very unusual classes (Fox? Snake? Bear?) and minimal equipment options didn't seem to mine the rich heritage of the iconic Red Box.<br/><br/>2. The limited value of armor (max was 14 during the game) and ready supply of Awesome tokens available to increase the likelihood of a hit meant that fights were brief (yay) and pretty deadly for both sides.  But it kind of made hitting a formality instead of a celebration (e.g. "I don't hit?  What's his Armor?  I'll spend 2 Awesome Tokens and hit him").<br/><br/>3. Non-variable damage for weapons is cool, but again it takes away the "Red Box" flavor.  Never having the chance of rolling max damage, or a critical hit, definitely decreases the anticipatory excitement of every combat roll.<br/><br/>4. I really like the tactical interplay of equipment and Arenas in theory.  I had thought they would operate somewhat similar to "Zones" in SOTC.  But in play the bonus seemed pretty minor compared to spending multiple Awesome Tokens, and fights seldom ranged across more than a single Arena at a time.<br/><br/>5. The Magus' Blast Talent seems quite overpowered.  It has a +2 attack bonus in every Arena and does as much damage as a Heavy weapon.  Admittedly, gaining this  means that the character has denied themselves another magical ability.  But for a dungeon crawl this is hardly a difficult choice.  The unlimited firepower of the Magus, with no loss of ability over time, again breaks the feel of classic D&amp;D.<br/><br/>6. It was a bit exhausting as a GM to try to come up with several "Dangers" for every Conflict action before the roll was made.  Especially when several of these would not come to pass so the effort was essentially wasted, except for color in the narration.<br/><br/>7. Monsters always have 10 HP and mooks are only effective in a fair size group.  This made it difficult to have a small combat encounter, which meant that pacing seemed to be a problem.  In classic D&amp;D some fights are out and out slaughtering a weaker opponent or smaller numbers - and this can be fun as players show off their bad-assery.  I tried to solve this issue by breaking larger monsters into smaller components, but that was only partially effective.  I think rules for half-size monsters, or minions with monster powers, would be fruitful for variety.<br/><br/>8.  The fact that Monsters don't vary in size, the Adventure section advice on tying NPCs to monsters, and the 3 Act structure suggested all indicate a game where there is only one monster at the end.  And that preceding this is a lot of interaction.  Although that structure is fine in an of itself, it doesn't seem to mesh well with the "bash-in-the-door-and-fight" ethic of dungeon crawling.<br/><br/>To summarize, the players and I (StoryGame enthusiasts with a good amount of experience in D&amp;D in various incarnations) were trying to play a game we hoped would deliver the best parts of a nostalgic D&amp;D experience in honor of Gary's Death.  Perhaps the unusual circumstances set our expectations inappropriately, or just too high.  But we felt let down by the game's large deviations from our shared understanding of what a "Red Box" experience is.<br/><br/>Obvious no game should be help accountable for not reading our minds.  And I think there are some great ideas in this game.  But this game feels to me neither "fish no fowl" which caused some cognitive dissonance during our play.<br/><br/>I'm likely to take some of the ideas that excited me in this game (Arenas, Awesome Tokens) and try them in another venue (probably Microlite 20) to see if they work better for me there.  But I welcome responses from Eric or other RBH players or GMs about their own experiences with the game and how they match or differ from mine.<br/><br/>And thanks to Eric for designing the game and being willing to receive my mixed bag of feedback in public.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134371/#Comment_134371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:04:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:04AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Flynn</cite>3.

Is it "1" or is it equal to the number of mooks attacking?<br/><br/>2 - Do all the monsters have light armor unless they take "Hard to See" and/or "Thick Skin"?<br/><br/>3 - Is there another way to use the mooks to defend the the monster? I know of "Minions". Also, if the monster stays on a different Arena while the characters fight the mooks elsewhere.

Thanks for bringing your RBH thoughts out here.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry your group was misled by the title.  The thing is no longer very closely related to D&amp;D at all.  Your group isn't the first one to feel that disconnect.  All I can say in my defense is that the thing <em>started</em> life as an honest to goodness hack of the red box.  It just kept growing and I never changed the title.  I'll get around to coming up with a new title eventually.</p>\n<p>Lemmie hit your questions here.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Question 1:  The "healer" in that bit of text refers to any character who's going to play nurse-maid, doctor, or quack to the hurt character.  The idea here isn't so much of "Does your party have a healer?" as it is "Tell me a short story about how this person tends to the wounds."  I wrote this bit of game with the desire to hear my players making up stuff like setting bones, mixing teas, or giving deep-tissue massages to the injured character.</p>\n<p>Question 2:  Awesome tokens are over powered right now.  Try using them as +1 to hit bonuses instead of +2 to hit bonuses.  I think that might fix some issues.  I don't think anyone has had an opportunity to playtest this change yet though, so tread carefully.</p>\n<p>Question 3:  You are correct.  You may not spend your awesome tokens on someone else's action.  If you want to help them do something, perform an assist action for them.</p>\n<p>Questions 4 &amp; 5:  Awesome tokens evaporate at the end of the combat scene.  No characters begin any combat scene with any tokens and there is no non-combat use for the tokens.  Period.  That's important.</p>\n<p>Question 6:  Use the lowest total result, Roll + Attribute.  Sorry for the ambiguous wording.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I don't have any specific responses for your other feedback, except for number 6.  If you ever feel exhausted coming up with dangers to roll for, then you shouldn't be rolling.  Just let the character get away with their action unscathed.  That's totally cool.</p>\n<p>All your other material there is cool, and is stuff that I can tell you that I'm already thinking about.  I can't promise any changes to the rules or anything, but I can say that a future version of the rules will probably address these issues, even if only to explain why I do or don't think it's a problem or how to get around the problem without a change to the rules.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your feedback.  I hope you'll tag along with us while we continue to work on this thing.</p>\n<p>Eric</p>\n<p>edited to fix some quirky formatting issues.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134460/#Comment_134460" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T14:16:13+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  2:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ronaldo,</p>\n<p>Thanks for your questions.  Lemmie see if I can give you some good answers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A group of mooks rolling together always produce a single point of damage.  However, as the GM, you can feel free to divide up larger groups of mooks into several smaller groups if you like.  For example, if you've got 5 mooks in the same arena you could roll 5d10 for the entire group, effectively guaranteeing a hit for a single point of damage, or your could divide them into a group of 3 and a group of 2.  The chances of doing damage go down just a bit, but now there's a chance of doing two points instead of just the one.</p></li>\n<li><p>That's correct.  I struggled with monsters and armor class for a while.  I had a hard time getting satisfied with it.  But this version I like.  No monster is ever "unarmored", and every stage of armor over Light is worth extra XP for killing it.</p></li>\n<li><p>You could also have your Mooks do Assist rolls for the monster.  I mean, it isn't a defense really, and Mooks never have really good attributes, but making a half-dozen assist rolls in a single turn for a monster should be enough to motivate any group of players to start targeting the mooks.  And if the players just target the monster and forget about the mooks?  That's cool.  Next time maybe give the players and their characters a little more reason to <em>want</em> to kill the mooks.  Something other than a tactical reason.  Let the players hate the mooks as much as they hate the monster.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134478/#Comment_134478" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T15:47:05+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  3:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 3:47PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Mooks assist, people die.

You don't ever roll to activate a talent.</p>\n<p><em>However</em></p>\n<p>The Conversational Spirit talent does not give any kind of domination power over spirits.  It's like a language skill.  You can speak the language of spirits at a conversational level.  Getting sprits to do things that they don't want to do might take a roll or two, and might involve some interesting dangers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
