<br/>
How can we rewrite Dogs such that the GM is given a character sheet that advances over time?<br/>
<br/>
Goals:<br/>
<br/>
1) A playable variant on Dogs.<br/>
2) Constrain the GM's ability to modify the story in a certain way.<br/>
3) The GM's ability to modify the story in this certain way changes based on the GM's actions.<br/>
4) Use the existing GM sheet as a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
This is hardly the only way to do this particular experiment, but why not start with a known quantity such as Dogs, says I.  If this generates a fruitful product lets run a playtest.<br/>

                            In the Reflection phase at the end of each town, the players discuss how hard it was to come to a conclusion on judgement and each rates the GM from one to three points.  In the next town, the GM can spend a point to add one to any of his die rolls in creating ProtoNPCs (I think higher rolls mean more and higher dice).  Any points he doesn't use are doubled for the next town.                        </div>

<p>It'd be really cool if we could manage to assign points (based on player attention) to the various stages of the Sin Hierarchy, if only as a feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>For instance, some GMs just capture the attention more with things that emerge in the Pride phase ... whereas other GMs are wicked-cool when things hit the False Doctrine phase.</p>
<p>It'd be nice both to give somebody concrete feedback on that ("Oh wow ... five points of attention on Sin ... I clearly did something right there!") and to let them feed this back into their next preparation ("Man, the Sin in the next town is gonna be <strong>beyond wicked</strong>.")</p>

                            Joshua, can you clarify this:<br/><br/><code>--Chris<br/>Joshua BishopRoby said:<br/><br/>In the Reflection phase at the end of each town, the players discuss how hard it was to come to a conclusion on judgement and each rates the GM from one to three points. </code><br/><br/>Which gets the "rating 3" ...? easier or harder?  Just curious as to which you see as the outcome to reward.  I suspect "harder" but the post wasn't clear to my mind <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But personally I would approach this from quite a different angle.<br/><br/>Given the  fact that Dogs encourages both sides to "play hard" as it were I would go down a route more like this:<br/><br/>The GM makes a Town as usual, the players make characters as usual.  the difference is that the GM can only assign dice to a number of NPCs equal to the number of PCs.  And those must be pre-assigned.<br/><br/>In play, any interaction with a non-diced NPC must follow the "say yes" part of Dog's primary rule, or only use Demonic Influence... the NPC has no dice of it's own.<br/><br/>The Diced NPCs follow the usual rules.  (yeah yeah "diced" makes it sound like they're chopped up.... you know what I mean....)<br/><br/>Now here's where the GM advances:<br/><br/>Each conflict between PCs and NPCs which ends with the PCs folding adds a dice to Demonic Influence.  Not necessarily always the standard d10s (or that would soon become lethal) but maybe make it inversely linked to how long the players stayed in the conflict.  Fold at the beginning with only 1 dice of fallout, and it's only social?  GM gets a d10 on Demonic Influence.  Fold after a few exchanges and 3 points of fighting fallout?  GM gets a d6 or a d8.  Fold towards the end after 6 points of gunfighting fallout..?  Maybe the GM only gets a d4, if that.<br/><br/>So the point is, the GM is rewarded by playing hard and tactically in Conflicts, by having more dice in Demonic Influence.  But they have to be careful... once they've lost their diced-NPCs they're gonna be a walk-over.<br/><br/><br/>Perhaps this makes the game a lot more adversarial than standard, but hopefully creates an initially level, but unstable playing field by making the GM's initial dice resources equal (ish) to the players.  Sure the GM has the Demonic Influence dice as an advantage when using the diced-NPCs, but the players are more likely to be acting in concert, and as we all know it's difficult to stop a gang of Dogs when their mind is set on winning.<br/><br/>The thing that worries me slightly is the fact that there is now an even bigger than standard disincentive to fold: the growing Demonic Influence.  Most players are loath to fold anyway IME.<br/><br/>Infact because of the way this would change the game I'd be tempted to just call the GM "Demonic Influence" and have their aim actually be to destroy the Dogs.<br/><br/>At the end of the town, you add up the number of dice the GM accrued in "bonus Demonic Influence" and they can keep that as a pool of d6 to add to non-diced-NPCs in the next town... making the mooks that bit harder as time goes by.<br/><br/>The reason I'd do it like this is three-fold:<br/><br/>1) it keeps the essentially conflict-based and instant advancement of the players as a feature for the GM<br/><br/>2) it doesn't rely on a new set of "appraisal rules" being grafted into the Dogs system, the advancement of the GM is more like a tweak of the existing ruleset.<br/><br/>3) to me peer appraisal based advancement doesn't sit well in Dogs.  It just doesn't feel right I think.<br/><br/>I dunno, clearly it's not too thouroughly thought out, but this is more the lines for allowing GM advancement that I would go down.  Essentially putting constraints on the amount of dice the GM can bring to bear and secondly tying GM advancement to conflicts like the players.<br/><br/>Side note... maybe you could just award the GM experience fallout, exactly like the players, but that it's non-NPC specific experience fallout that can be used with any NPC, diced or un-diced.  If the GM chooses to add a Stat dice, then they are generic Stat dice which can be used on any NPC.  If the GM chooses to create a Trait, then it's a named "World Trait" and is added to the GM-Sheet like "The wind howls through the streets 2d8" or "Conflict stirs the Demon's hatred 1d10" or whatever.<br/><br/>Drew<br/><br/>*edit for a bit more clarity hopefully*                        </div>

                            You know, in Dogs, one of the counter-intuitive observations you see a lot is this:  the fewer, taller Sin-ladders you have, the easier a town is to understand and judge.<br/>
<br/>
So: a full blown False-Priesthood with Murder and all the trimmings, in a clear, logical progression, is easy for the dogs to get, and easy for them to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Lotsa little Prides are way harder to track down, and much harder to judge.<br/>
<br/>
So, if GM advancement should increase his oomph, as it were, I'd start off limiting the Town Creation sin selection.  That a "starting GM" - although maybe really it's a starting campaign -- or Branch Circuit or whatever.  I mean, _players_ don't advance mechanically, their characters do.  By the same token, you reward the GM by advancing the Branches.<br/>
<br/>
Limit it like this: a starting Dog Stewardship can have one chain of sin, that must go at least as high as False Doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how they advance?  I'd reward different kind of conflict, so my recommendation would be: multiply the number of kinds of Fallout dice by the fewest number received of any type, or something along those lines.                        </div>

<p>I ... don't know.  That's a good question, though.  Do you put your attention where you've been strong, or where you've been weak?  Or, maybe, you just tell them "This is how you did last town, here's your resources, <em>you</em> decide."</p>

                            The GM gets no Free Dice for NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, each conflict, they take the two highest showing PC fallout dice.  At the end of the town, roll these dice.  Anything that comes up 3+ can be used as a free die next town.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a number of a certain type of die (say d4s) equal to the number of players, you may "cash those in" for a fixed free dice -- you get one of that die type free for every town.<br/>

                            Rrrrrrrrrrrr3, I meant higher rewards for harder, yeah.<br/><br/>I'm really intrigued by this thread, but I'd like to throw up a little red flag of concern.  We're talking about modifying <em>Dogs</em>, which is one of the tighter game designs out there (outside its mob rules).  Especially since we're starting with such a fine-tuned engine, any such modification is going to <em>change Dogs</em>, and I suspect not for the better.<br/><br/>I think it's a really good and useful exercise to be throwing around these ideas, but at the same time I think we should be very conscious that we're conducting thought experiments, not 'fixing Dogs,' and the changes that we are proposing, if put into actual practice, would result in a slightly-to-massively different game entirely.<br/><br/>But keep 'em coming, this is interesting!                        </div>

                            The benefit of looking at this in Dogs is that the tightness of the system will show more stresses than other systems, and that will let us know more about what is going on.                        </div>

                            I agree with Joshua that there is little to "fix" in Dogs.  The advantage I see of this approach is what thor outlines, that we will be able to see clearly what effects our new systems have on a well tuned game.  A further effect, by messing with a concrete and well established system we have less to create to nail down a playable variant.  Which is what I'm going to try to do :)<br/>
<br/>
First, an observation -- I think all of the variant suggestions so far are really neat.  I especially like assigning points to the stages of sin hierarchy.  It is very interesting that just about every suggestion uses the players actions or even presence as some metric to give the GM "XP".  In some cases this is so that the GM advancement is balanced against player power.  In others this is so that XP can serve as a feedback mechanism from the players to the GM.<br/>
<br/>
Something that sets Dog's apart mechanically is that XP is player assigned.  After fallout or the end of a town a player can assign themselves XP in the form of a stat point, an item, or the like.  So XP is not assigned to them by the game master.<br/>
<br/>
When creating my own GM advancement in Dogs, I want it to feel like player advancement.  To this end:<br/>
<br/>
Before every town the game master fills out his "character sheet", the GM sheet here: http://www.lumpley.com/games/pdfs/pulloutsgencon.pdf .  NPCs are generated using the random system presented in Dogs.  NPCs do not need to be fully detailed, as Dogs indicates, but they do need to have names.  The "Town" part of the game master sheet should be fleshed out well, the gamemaster should have a good idea of what the sins in the town are, and how they are manifesting themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In general the GM should never erase information off his sheet, but he can add missing information, especially to NPCs, as the game goes on.  Save the GM sheet for each town, should the Dogs ever return it may come in handy!<br/>
<br/>
The game master can add new information (not just missing info) using an experience system similar to player experience.<br/>
<br/>
After every resolution the game master can choose one item from the experience table with which to modify his sheet for every fallout die he rolled.  Also, he can also choose one item from the same table between towns, at the same time the players do.<br/>
<br/>
The experience table will either modify items on his sheet; giving him new characters to play with, more dice to roll, or improving the NPCs he has in play; or it will let him carry his characters over from one town to the next, assuming they survive the tender mercies of the player characters.  The experiences gained here can be assumed, if you like, to be the experiences that the King of Life himself gains as he tests his Dogs.  It is in this spirit that experience should be used, as tools to bring out the true character and beliefs of the Dogs themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Experience:<br/>
<br/>
- Gain a new trait that you can roll in any relevant conflict.  This trait should relate to one PC specifically and involve something they did that will come back to haunt them, by memory, consequence, or in person.  (e.g. Ruth's unborn child, Jacob's murder of the farmer).  The trait is saved from town to town.<br/>
<br/>
- Indicate on your GM sheet that you are going to save one NPC for a future town.    Save this GM sheet for future reference, you can copy this NPC onto any future sheet instead of adding a randomly generated NPC.<br/>
<br/>
- Give every NPC involved in one level of the story a new trait, item, or relationship.  Different traits, items, or relationships can be used for each NPC.  The NPCs name must be written on the GM's sheet at the appropriate level.<br/>
<br/>
