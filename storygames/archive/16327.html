"Imperial Sci-Fi Adventure", I guess.  There's some GM advice in there, too.  I guess I'm not sure what the players are supposed to do.  Acknowledging that there's probably no "right way to play"... what's the right way to play?<br/><br/>Or maybe the "suggested" way to play.  Sandbox?  Adventure of the Week?  Something else?  Should players just work toward some lofty goal of their PCs?  There's not really much in the way of meta-game "scoring" to shoot for.<br/><br/>Is there an optimal play expectation that the rules support?  I don't know.

One way to play would be to let the Hooks drive the adventure in some way--through the GM pulling in a prior nemesis or some traumatic event from a character's past, or the players focusing on a specific Hook to provide a goal and direction.  Hooks are explicitly described as 'tools for roleplaying', and provide mechanical bonuses when they're relevant to the conflict at hand--so the rules support that type of play.  <br/>Another element of Thousand Suns that is a signal for play is the option to spend Benefit Points on 'Starship Mortgage Share'.  How's that for instant motivation!  The characters get to start the game in debt, needing to pay off the bank for a starship.  Rather than a lofty goal, the characters just want to pay this month's bill.  Over the course of a campaign, you can imagine they face some tough choices:  boring, guaranteed contracts, versus high risk--high payoff endeavors; choosing jobs that help a cause but have little profit, etc.  This economic motivation is a theme that exists at least as far back as original Traveller, and exists in starship and tech maintenance costs in new games such as Ashen Stars--and I think we can see paying the bill as a motivator for classic space opera heroes such as Han Solo and Mal Reynolds.  <br/>Characters do earn experience points and can spend those points for skills and new Hooks; that is a 'scoring' system of sorts--although it is individual scoring and not 'global' or 'universal' (as with, say, Disposition in the Infection mechanics of Burning Empires--the characters' success or lack thereof against the Valen invaders is measured.)  I could see reducing the cost of _replacement_ Hooks (to replace Hooks that have been resolved in some way during play) from the standard 10 XP needed for a new Hook as a means of encouraging play to address some aspect of a character's life.  But the rules don't seem to talk about resolving Hooks in that manner. <br/>As the book points out, Hooks can often be players' flags to the GM about the types of adventures they want to see, in terms of villains ("on the run from the Black Hole gang") or types of challenges ("fastest blaster in the quadrant").  But they could also be elements of the character that the player wants to be unchallenged--similar to Backgrounds in Chronica Feudalis, although, in Thousand Suns, the Hook _will_ come up, in order to earn action points--the only Hook I can think of of this kind might be something like, "this is a job for Superman" (to deviate from the genre for a bit).  This being the case, the 'right' way to play is for the GM and the players to be in agreement on what the Hooks mean in terms of how they will be used in the game.  <br/>In sum, I like the Traveller/SOTC mix in Thousand Suns.  I've played locally in a 'SOTC in Space' game that was a lot of fun (this was before Diaspora and before Bulldogs); we could have just as easily have been playing Thousand Suns.  The only hard part I foresee is getting used to the 12 Degree system--roll 2d12 and _low_ is good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372943/#Comment_372943" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T10:29:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2012 10:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2012 10:30AM by zircher.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Humor] <blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>blah blah blah <b>Traveller</b> blah blah and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">low</span> is good!</blockquote>\nUm, what he said!

How are they expected to play?</blockquote>\nI think Thousand Suns is written with the expectation that the plot is GM driven.  Players use Action Points to affect dice rolls, but not for narrative purposes.  So players are 'expected' to react to the plot hooks thrown out by the GM.  I think the game would sound a lot like the Star Wars game described in the <a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Actual People, Actual Play</a> podcast.  The PCs, who are a starship crew, are typically directed to planets for missions or cargo runs by the owner of the ship.  Actions at the planets are entirely up to the players, but the initial hook comes from the GM. <br/>I don't think this is 'sandboxy'--the characters are actually not free to explore anywhere, at least, not once the adventure arc is started.  I'm sure between adventures the GM will take into account player desires to go explore Dagobah or Endor or whatever. One interesting point the GM made in a previous episode was that a fight on a train, which occurred on Planet X would have taken place regardless of what planet the characters went to--the event 'moved' to fit the players' decisions.  <br/>I've seen Traveller played both ways--sandbox style, and hook &amp; line style.  Sandbox style works for Traveller because/if the GM has written up the subsector, or writes it up with the players before the game, or writes it up system by system with the players in play.  Traveller systems have the system profile--world size, atmosphere, population, government type, law level, etc.  The GM and players can look at a system profile and make some determinations about the system, to decide what might be happening there to make it interesting or profitable or both.  <br/><br/>Thousand Suns includes rules for sector design, and 'world hooks' so sandbox play is definitely possible.  I think it would work best if the GM and players make at least the first few systems of the sector  together.  I've actually done that once using the earlier rules--but then we played Traveller in that sector!  I regretted the lack of a system profile, though, as a shorthand for what the system was like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski" title="James Maliszewski"><img alt="James Maliszewski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski">James Maliszewski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373046/#Comment_373046" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T07:38:05+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  7:38AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, thanks for purchasing <i>Thousand Suns</i>.<br/><br/>On the larger question of this thread, I can only tell you how <i>I</i> play, but, despite being the game's designer, I don't claim that this is the <i>only</i> way to do so. <br/><br/>When I speak of "imperial science fiction," I'm thinking largely of authors like H. Beam Piper or Poul Anderson, particularly the latter, whose "Technic Civilization" series provides examples of the two types of campaigns I've run. The first, similar to Anderson's Van Rijn/Falkayn stories, involve the players taking the roles of independent operators who skirt the line the between legal and illegal activity. These characters tend to wander around, going where they wish, often following up leads I've scattered about. This is more or less sandbox play. The second, similar to Anderson's Flandry stories, involves the players taking on the roles of agents of some authority, whether local or galactic. These characters are more directed in their actions, as they have superiors who give them "missions" or otherwise point them in the right direction. <br/><br/>I've had a lot of fun and success with both approaches and <i>Thousand Suns</i> was written to support both, but neither is <i>the</i> way to play, just the ways I personally prefer. <br/><br/>Was this helpful?

That is, I agree with you that, in principle, a designer can tell people how to play his game, but it's not something I have much interest in doing.

The other leads to confusion and upset players because you're trying and failing due to unclear rules, misunderstood play procedures, etc.<br/><br/>EDIT: It's been brought to my attention I'm totally being a thread-ruiner!
