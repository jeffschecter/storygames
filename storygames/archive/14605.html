Hopefully more Danger Patrol is going to be popping up.  It seems like (just from a few readings) Danger Patrol end ups very One True Path-y (I won't say railroad-y <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>.)  Since the only end condition for both types of scenese is basically "finish every Threat/Question the GM throws at you." I wonder what people think about these tweaks to the scenes?<br/><br/>1. I'd like to add either/or linked threats, so there's some decision/strategizing to be done.  I could see the Arena layed out as almost a maze/puzzle with lots of different ways to come at the various big problems.<br/><br/>2. You'd probably need to add "inactive" threats that don't get a free move if they're ignored, until someone attacks them.  So maybe you can either fight your way through guards, or sneak in the back door to get to the Villain's Lair.  If you fight the guards and ignore the door, the door doesn't get a free move, and vice versa.  (Villian's Lair still does, because it's not Inactive.)<br/><br/>3. I want to tweak the end conditions for Suspense scenes (and possibly action scenes) so that it's not guaranteed that all the questions will be answered.  I like the idea of ongoing mysteries, with players investigating what they find cool until they unlock some mystery/find the villains lair/set off a disaster, which erupts into an Action scene.  I'm not exactly sure what the right end conditions would be.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332502/#Comment_332502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:02:12+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:02AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 11:03AM by stupidgremlin.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the great things about DangerPatrol is how versatile it can actually be, when describing actions as part of the narrative. Here's how I would handle your tweaks:<br/>1) Either/Or Threats: This is already handled pretty much as part of the DP rules. Threats do not explicitly have one particular way to go about solving or defeating them. I have had players in the past defeat monsters with Commando and Warrior, but also with Professor ("Aha, I think it has a weakness to this chemical solution!"), Detective ("I'm gonna convince these goons that I've got connections with the mob"), and Daredevil ("I'll sway them to my side with my tales of derring-do!"). It's all about tackling the threats creatively.<br/>2)Inactive Threats: With the situation you have described here, it sounds more like a Suspense Scene. Have the players figure some way into the lair, and if they fail (or, in fact, if they succeed, but from a very tactically unsound way), introduce the guards as threats in the following Action Scene.<br/>3) Suspense End Conditions: Here, this is the copy-and-pasted text from my custom "Question Moves" that I use for Suspense Scenes.<br/><b>Danger 1: It\u2019s trickier than it looks...</b><br/>Some detail arises that makes the investigation more difficult in some way. Put a d6 Danger Die on the question card. The next time a PC investigates that question, the GM rolls those extra Danger Dice separately \u2013 but these dice only count for Danger, not Hits! Danger Dice remain on the card until the question is answered.<br/><br/><b>Danger 2: I meant to do that...</b><br/>Do a reduced hit to the PC. This is a consequence of the PC\u2019s investigations, such as stress, overwork, a minor chemical explosion, a shock from frayed wires, bruises from an inconsequential bar brawl, etc. Any conditions suffered from such harm should reflect the nature of the situation. Alternatively, this may exhaust one of the PC\u2019s Gear instead.<br/><br/><b>Danger 3: Well, that complicates things!</b><br/>Your PC uncovers something that interrupts his immediate investigation, forcing him to solve a secondary problem first. This may be a red herring, some malfunction with his equipment, needing to go to a new location to find fresh information, or perhaps decoding alien messages. This should be created as a new staged question or setback, usually one threat level lower than the original problem. Once it has been resolved, the PC will obtain what he needs to continue with his original research.<br/><br/><b>Danger 4: I got a bad feeling about this...</b><br/>The PC\u2019s investigation has attracted unwanted attention, or reveals details that will need to be resolved later. Perhaps a villain has taken notice of the PC snooping around, and sends some goons to rough him up, or maybe the PC learns (mistakenly or not) that a teammate is a traitor, and he wants to confront him. The GM creates this as a new threat, one level lower than the question being investigated, that will be introduced during the next action scene.<br/><br/><b>Danger 5: Inconceivable!!</b><br/>Despite the PC\u2019s best efforts, his investigation is completely derailed, and the question goes unanswered. The PC suffers a full hit as a result, and the situation immediately dissolves into an Action Scene! What have you DONE?!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332523/#Comment_332523" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:51:12+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:51AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, tweaks!<br/><br/>I love stuff like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332556/#Comment_332556" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T14:46:28+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  2:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks for the suggestions.  It does seem useful to have a different danger table for suspense scenes.  <br/>Do you leave the same set of questions (and Danger dice) in the "Suspense Arena" between Action scenes?<br/>Do you still have un-investigated questions do automatic Moves between "rounds"?<br/><br/>I really like the idea of a Total Disaster in a Suspense scene kicking off an Action scene.  I'm wondering how important it is that that means a Master Question with a few Linked questions basically means that every suspense scene only lasts for one round for a few cycles until the Linked questions are burned off.<br/><br/>Either/or and Inactive threats might make more sense in Suspense scenes, if Actions scenes are always more focused on a single area/fight.  But it still seems important to be able to set up a "tree" of challenges where the players have more choice at a high level about which approach they want to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332562/#Comment_332562" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T15:22:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  3:22PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very rarely have questions carried over from one Suspense Scene to another. Usually I'm assuming that if it goes unanswered, then the characters obviously didn't think it was very important. Once or twice, I've left them on the board, because I thought they were important, and wanted to emphasize that, though I didn't have them do any Moves because they were ignored...I might have to do that...<br/><br/>My Suspense Scenes have, with my Question Moves, lasted maybe three or four rounds at tops. I've never really given any questions that needed more than five hits to answer, but that's just me. Most of my players tend to more...active...roles, and solving things is rarely their strong suit. It is an excuse to throw more difficult questions at them, I'm sure, but I don't want them to become mired in their investigations too much.<br/><br/>I'm still not seeing where the problem is with different approaches to a threat, though. Maybe give an example of what you are thinking of?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332570/#Comment_332570" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T17:05:07+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  5:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might not matter much with only one "layer" of linked threats. I'm imagining a villain's fortress where you could kill the guards in front, then fight a big Lt. before you can get to the Big Bad. OR you can sneak in the back, disarm some mystical traps, then fight him. But you can't really mix the two solutions. <br/><br/>Maybe a better example would be a ritual the requires a key to unlock. Three different villains (or maybe a villian, some ancient ruins, and a ritual to create a new key) have a copy of the key, with different stats/flavors. Dealing with any of them will let you get a key, and then the group can start working on the ritual.<br/><br/>I'm kind of imagining suspense scenes with long running plots, kind of like AW fronts that the PCs can try to work against. Which is why I'm curious about their larger role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332856/#Comment_332856" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T08:12:12+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  8:12AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>I want to tweak the end conditions for Suspense scenes (and possibly action scenes) so that it's not guaranteed that all the questions will be answered.</blockquote>\nI was experimenting with it solo, and in the suspense scene had the party split investigating two murder mysteries at once - and decided enough threats had built up that it was time to go to action, even though one of the mysteries was still unsolved. <br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12071&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">I briefly tried Mark's inspectres-ish tweak</a> - it's neat for player authority, but it can ruin the suspense, because a player will pretty easily say, after one roll "The butler did it; and he's hiding out in the skytower."  <br/><br/>I like the idea of players being able to ask any question they want to and the GM assigns a point cost to it (or answers right away if they decide its trivial) and then giving the players +1 if they act on the knowledge. So you might ask "What is the Crimson Monkey's weakness?" Gm throws down the index card, secretly assigns it 1 or 2 points, and once you answer it "I do an autopsy on the Crimson Monkey" you'll be able to take +1 on your Crimson Monkey fighting.<br/><br/>I'm also working on a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GM-less </span> co-GM'd bolt-on. I've got something I think works but haven't tested it with other humans yet. It's basically: Czege principle threats (If you make a threat your PC is not allowed to deal with it); and you need to create threats to buy off a point debt you start with, which is randomly distributed amongst the GMs. And people who don't want GM authority don't have to take it. Danger Patrol, Ghost/Echo, and maybe Poison'd are uniquely suited to a new kind of "GM-less", because of the discrete threats and the possibility of splitting up ownership...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333158/#Comment_333158" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T09:55:47+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  9:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hoping to find a way to get some player feedback in Suspense scenes too, either by asking questions, or choosing which questions to go after.<br/><br/>I like the idea of player owned threats, where you basically become the GM for an Action scene when your threat pops in a Suspense scene.  I agree that there's a lot of potential for 'GM-ful' games where everyone has responsibility for some threats.  Castle Ravenloft is the baby steps version of this.  I think the shift between Suspense scenes as mostly GM-less freeform, and Action scenes as mostly GMed set pieces should work really well if you can find the right balance.<br/><br/>It would require more guidelines on what a reasonable mix of threats is for an Action scene, and how you handle bonus threats from Suspense scenes there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333221/#Comment_333221" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T14:02:41+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  2:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>Suspense scenes as mostly GM-less freeform</blockquote>\nThat sort of thing is not usually my cup o' tea, but something about that phrase has stuck in my brain.
