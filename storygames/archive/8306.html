There should be some intense interactions among the PCs coming up, an interesting investigation, and we still don\u2019t know who the vampire is. Could be an everyday guy or Caesar himself. Also, my character (Cordia) is low on coins and I've been rolling for crap, so I'm pretty sure the vampire will be gaining a hold on her soon. Which is neat! And bad! And neat! I'm so glad we found another time to play again soon - that's the worst part of this game - not being able to play the whole thing at once and having to WAIT.

Hmm...I'd imagine it would be hard to end it any other way, so I suppose it *is* a part of the design. There are four phases, and I guess it takes about 3-6 sessions (depending on # of people and how quickly things build), of average length (2-4 hours?) to run through all four phases. The first phase introduces the characters, setting, and begins the story. It fairly quick - you could run through it and part of the second phase in one session. The second phase (where we're at) is the longest. Probably requires 1.5 - 3 sessions. There's a lot of building up of the characters, the story, and the tension. The last two phases (Confrontation and Aftermath) could probably be completed in one session. So any time you end a session (except for the last), there's going to be building tension (which is sweetly agonizing to impatient kid in me). Does that make sense?<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185051/#Comment_185051" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T14:40:15+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  2:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27310.0" rel="nofollow">Session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a></a>.<br/><br/>We fought harder with stakes this time. Friends and enemies are becoming clearer. We still aren't sure who the vampire is, but we're getting close, and we're probably only a couple of scenes away from moving into the Confrontation phase. I think this next session will likely be our last.<br/><br/>I am continually delighted by the role Claims play in the game. They encourage strong motifs as you might find in any good story, and they also keep things from getting too predictable. Throwing them in can change the direction of things, or give events much greater depth. And, of course, because everyone has Claims, everyone contributes interesting stuff but with limitations - no one can steer the story too strongly in their preferred direction. This can be frustrating at times, and liberating, too, and we're all realizing that this game is truly collaborative.<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185085/#Comment_185085" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-28T08:13:20+00:00" title="December 28, 2008  8:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the write-up, Rachel.<br/><br/>Oh - bought the game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185098/#Comment_185098" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-28T16:35:17+00:00" title="December 28, 2008  4:35PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2008 4:49PM by EarthenForge.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, Per! I'd love to hear your thoughts when you get a chance to try it out. Part if the reason I feel motivated to do full APs for our sessions is because there's not much out there yet. I know there are a bunch of people who have this game, and a bunch of people who've loved the first session or so that they've played, but I haven't heard much in the way of details - the kinds of stories, the ends, any problems or things they've loved, etc - the kind of stuff that's helpful in "getting" a new game you're trying to play. So I figured I'd put our experiences out there. Spread the word a little. And, as this game slowly leaks into other people's lives, I look forward to hearing about others experiences with it too.<br/><br/>Too bad you're not even in the same country - I'd love to play this with you.

Must admit that it wasn't the title that tempted me into buying the game, not at all, but rather Per's writing, and when I started reading the book, I immediately noticed this statement:\n<blockquote>At its core, the game is about managing destructive emotions via the metaphor of the struggle against the Vampire. On a less visceral level, the game is about creating Vampire stories from the perspective not of the Vampire, but of his victims, servants, enemies, and others affected by his appetites.</blockquote>\nAfter that I just had to finish reading and that was quickly done. Now I am looking forward to play the game, really. <br/><br/>Oh, another positive thing about the game. The two examples reminded me of reading the first edition of Vampire (which was the only time, I wanted to play that game), and of the good, olde Ravenloft-setting (before it went from Gothic Horror to Gothic Fantasy or somesuch), now I can finally return to Ravenloft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
