I\u2019m considering using the X-card in any games I might write that have high bleed potential, but I have a couple of queries and a request for AP info.  <br/><br/>Query 1. I get that picking up the X-card enables any player (including the facilitator, as pointed out in the report), to call a halt to the proceedings, at which point the group can scale back on the uncomfortable content. Now this is all fine and dandy when it\u2019s pretty obvious what content is causing the problem, forex the bandits assaulting the women- or rather not, as that scene was skipped in the end-  in bookscorpion\u2019s Last Train out of Warsaw game, but what about those times when it\u2019s not necessarily clear what the content was that was objectionable or problematic?<br/><br/>Query 2. I read somewhere that the X-card can have a flipside- the O-card- where a player wants more of a particular topic. My question is two-fold: has anyone ever used the X-card also as an O-card, and can the two sometimes conflict, i.e. one player wants more, while another player wants less- and what should one do in these cases?<br/><br/>Finally, can anyone give a practical example of a situation where the use of the X-card (with or without the O flip side) successfully prevented a topic causing unwanted discomfort?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416932/#Comment_416932" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T19:12:49+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  7:12PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it isn't obvious and the X-er doesn't want to discuss it, take a break and return to the game with a new scene.

If you have the card you have to explain it, and if you explain it you are setting expectations about maturity and respect that are then typically met.

It's about creating tools to improve our hobby, because at current lots of people feel unwelcome or unsafe based on content that they've encountered in games where they felt unsupported in dealing with it. People don't always feel capable of self-advocating, it's often perceived as dangerous to self-advocate, and the X-card is one technique (along with The Veil, etc) used to create safe spaces.\n<blockquote>Finally, can anyone give a practical example of a situation where the use of the X-card (with or without the O flip side) successfully prevented a topic causing unwanted discomfort?</blockquote>\nWhen I do the intro speech at <a href="http://terminalcitystorygames.com" rel="nofollow">Terminal City Story Games</a>, I include a talk about boundaries that borrows elements from The Veil talk used in parts of the PNW, and the X-Card used by jenskot and many others. It goes:<br/><br/><i>This is our X card. Each group will have one, resting within easy reach on the table. When someone introduces something into the story that crosses a line for you, that makes you think, \u201cI don't want to go there right now,\u201d you can hold up this card. Or if you'd prefer, you can say, \u201cI'd rather not go there.\u201d<br/><br/>We'll pause, and figure out our next step. Maybe it stays in the story, but we fade to black and start a new scene. Maybe it gets pulled and the person who authored it replaces it and we just keep on moving. Maybe we take a quick water break and return a few minutes later to discuss next steps.<br/><br/>The important thing is that: if you don't want to go there, we don't have to go there. We can change directions. No one is going to make you explain yourself when you use the X card. We just figure out what everyone needs, and we accommodate them. In most cases, we just edit out the problem content, replace it, and keep on rolling.</i><br/><br/>A thing I've focused on when giving that speech is that there is no one solution that will work in every case. The Veil or The X-Card doesn't replace our complicated interpersonal toolsets that we've spent our whole lives developing... it signals that now is the time to use them. Maybe the stock solution of "edit out the problem content, keep moving" works, but maybe not. It's case + person + issue + game-dependent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416937/#Comment_416937" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T20:22:23+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  8:22PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah! I forgot to answer the question.\n<blockquote>Finally, can anyone give a practical example of a situation where the use of the X-card (with or without the O flip side) successfully prevented a topic causing unwanted discomfort?</blockquote>\nI have arachnophobia. Spiders sometimes trigger panic attacks.<br/><br/>In gaming situations that weren't prefaced by a conversation about boundaries, if giant spider monsters get introduced I typically have to plead, "No, seriously, please don't include this" about four times before anyone takes me seriously. The first time I say it they think I'm joke-pleading. The second time, they assume I'm joking and laugh. The third time, they assume I'm milking the joke for all it's worth, and kind of roll their eyes and politely chuckle once more. By the fourth time, they tend to think I might be serious, and then proceed to backpedal or say something defensive like, "Well, if you're serious, why didn't you say so?" I always feel super awkward and not supported.<br/><br/>In gaming situations that were prefaced by a conversation about boundaries, if giant spider monsters get introduced I typically have to say "Hey, this crosses a line for me. No spiders." That's it. I'm respected. Maybe I have to repeat myself a second time, but certainly not a third.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I've seen people X out lots of different stuff: child abuse, rape, dog abuse, names with particular significance for them, spiders.<br/><br/>Once I was playing The Quiet Year and someone very seriously said, "Hey, I don't want to start talking about construction logistics like this. I'm a trained architect, it'll push me into architect mode, and my suspension of belief will be lost. Let's not demand an explanation for how the pipes are tethered, or anything like that. Thanks."<br/><br/>I've often seen people be supported and accommodated with no defensiveness or weaseling. I've occasionally seen or heard about folks getting talked over, and resigning themselves to a problematic/triggering/upsetting story element remaining in the story. That's a bummer. I'm hoping we continue to refine our toolset.<br/><br/>I really like it when the Veil speech or the X-Card speech mentions that you can remove content that you see others getting really uncomfortable with, if you're worried that it's no longer a safe space for everyone at the table. Some folks freeze up when experiencing triggering or upsetting content. It's about empathy and checking in with people, not about policing anybody else's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416940/#Comment_416940" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T21:02:07+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  9:02PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 9:03PM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[trigger warning: sexual assault]</b><br/><br/>Last night, I was MCing Monsterhearts at a dinner/story-games party. I'd played games with one of the players, knew one of the other players from email conversations, and was a total stranger to the final two.<br/><br/>I figured we'd create characters, then have a conversation on boundaries, then start play. But I was playing with multiple screenwriters at the table, so my timing was a little off*. The very first thing that the Ghost player says is, "Well, before I died... I had a father, and let's just say that he was obsessive.." and he explains that his character was cornered in her basement by an unstable father who, unable to bring himself to sexually assault her, decided instead to strangle her, bury her under their dirt-floor basement, and tell his wife that their only daughter hadn't returned from school that day.<br/><br/>Deep breath. The description was frank and not timid. I quickly glance around at other eyes in the room. I take the opportunity to pause the game setup and talk about boundaries. In addition to the speech I outlined above, I mention that, "While we're all here to tell a story about messed-up teenage lives, this is also our weekend. We're here on our free time. And if we don't want to go somewhere with our weekend, if we don't want to explore a certain dark corner, we don't have to. Just say the word, and content can get rewritten to make sure we're all feeling safe."<br/><br/>And the Ghost's backstory held. She was killed by a father sexually obsessed with her but unable to bring himself to realize his goals. She was buried underneath the basement. The witch moved in, and brought her back to the world through an accidental act of magic. The ghost now haunts her house, watches her sleep, mourns the bedroom she lost but is still tied to.<br/><br/>And it all felt okay, because we all had an opportunity to retreat from it when and if needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>*screenwriters are professional get-to-the-pathos technicians.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416942/#Comment_416942" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T21:10:58+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  9:10PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 9:21PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Query 2.

The third time, they assume I'm milking the joke for all it's worth, and kind of roll their eyes and politely chuckle once more.

Usually, the scenes are prescribed, so while the players can improvise inside the lines, they aren't making up as much out of whole cloth. It's the job of the GM/blurb writer to be upfront about the content of the game so that people can select out of it before the game begins. <br/><br/>It's also the job of the GM to a) create a supportive atmosphere where people feel their boundaries will be respect, b) introduce the cut/brake rules in case something goes awry and c) make it clear that finishing the game is way less important than making someone feel horrible in a bad way.<br/><br/>I think this is different from indie tabletop games where there is more emphasis on creating content on the fly. to my mind, this has a bigger danger of veering into territory that's uncomfortable for the players since there's a more infinite set of options. So the X-card makes more sense in tabletop games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417004/#Comment_417004" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T15:44:39+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  3:44PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I heard feedback from a number of people at Knutepunkt was that the "Break" option (equivalent to the X-card from what I read) was never used - even by people being made uncomfortable.  I've personally never seen it used.  <br/><br/>One concern was this:   By making it a formal option that stops the game, using "Break" means that the person has to publicly put their trigger on display and stop the game for everyone else.  It's hard to do this, because people usually feel a social pressure not to mess up other players' fun.  <br/><br/>So while there is nothing wrong with having an X-card or "Break" rule, I think it's useful to have a more quiet/private alternative.  A simple approach is to have a trustworthy person who is publicly responsible - that anyone can talk to privately to explain their concerns.  Another safeguard is to encourage people to bring up issues in advance, by setting a tone where everyone is respected and open in the beginning.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417050/#Comment_417050" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T20:51:26+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  8:51PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2013 9:21PM by James_Stuart.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to note, Cut is generally the "stop the scene, right now" word, and Brake is the "let's slow down, but not stop". That said, I've heard the same notes that these words are not used often in the Nordic scene, for a variety of interesting reasons.<br/><br/>I think the point of these stop mechanisms is that quiet/private alternatives, and previous tone discussions aren't necessarily quick enough, especially in indie tabletop, where players are often expected to invent dramatic twists on the spot. In a game of a Durance hack (set in a high school) where we didn't have an X-card, a player took one of his frustrated notable characters, and described him getting a gun and heading towards the school to take revenge against a teacher, and I looked around uncomfortably, and then had to say that I didn't want a school shooting. We negotiated it out, but I definitely felt a lot more awkward and even a bit frustrated that I had to push several times before we finally got rid of that scene.<br/><br/>If you had asked me a list of things that I wouldn't want in that game beforehand? I'm not sure I would have conjured that. Was that scene out of tone with the rest of the game? Not really, it was (as Durance is), a dark game. But did I want that scene to happen? Not at all.<br/><br/>I think you're totally right that especially before and after intense games, you want to have time to reflect, talk about feelings, and see where people are.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417057/#Comment_417057" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T22:58:35+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 10:58PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have arachnophobia. Spiders sometimes trigger panic attacks.</blockquote>\nMe too. I can generally handle games where spiders are there, but there's no visual representation.<br/><br/>Where I've had problems is usually when there's a book with an illo or photo. My copy of the old Monster Manual had pieces of cardboard over the pages where there were illos that made me want to slam the book shut and flee. Mind, I did not object to the existence of these illos, because they were illustrating descriptions accurately. I just didn't want to see them.<br/><br/>Chaosium had an unfortunate period that I call its Bug Period. For some reason, someone decided that random pages of all of the Call of Cthulhu books coming out would have pictures of bugs or spiders sprinkled throughout, with no connection to the text whatsoever. The newer version of the Kingsport book has nothing in it to justify these illos. Nothing. I will not buy the 6th edition rulebook.<br/><br/>Again, this is not "Here's a picture of the Leng spider accompanying the description of the Leng spider". It's not "Here's a scenario about Atlach-Nacha, the mythos spider deity." I know to brace myself for that.\n<blockquote>Once I was playing The Quiet Year and someone very seriously said, "Hey, I don't want to start talking about construction logistics like this. I'm a trained architect, it'll push me into architect mode, and my suspension of belief will be lost. Let's not demand an explanation for how the pipes are tethered, or anything like that. Thanks."</blockquote>\nThat's very useful to know in play, yes. My first instinct is to ask the player with the specialized knowledge to use it to help explain away errors or rewrite / reshoot (redescribe?) the scene so that the effect I'm trying for is achieved without breaking reality as he knows it. If that's not what the player wants, I'm totally fine with that, but I do need to know.<br/><br/>There are also situational things. Before I ran a session a couple of days after the Boston Marathon, one of my players asked, "Can we not focus on the anarchist plotline just yet?" Happily, I'd planned a completely different scenario with a completely different plotline, but even if I hadn't, yes, absolutely -- so long as I know there's a "let's not go there" on the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417074/#Comment_417074" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T02:06:04+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  2:06AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like one of the benefits of an x-card might be bolder play.

I think that's a good idea. \n<blockquote>One concern was this: By making it a formal option that stops the game, using "Break" means that the person has to publicly put their trigger on display and stop the game for everyone else.

Like some weird stance amongst certain players that it's more "hardcore" not to use these rules. I haven't followed these debates closely, but am aware of them.<br/><br/>It might not be an ideal system, but I'm glad it's there. I don't know of any better alternatives, of the top of my head. <br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure, but I think I've used the Break-option once in my 16 years of larping here in Norway, and the Cut-option 0 times. When I used the Break-option, it was to ensure the safety of fellow players who were about to go climb on a slippery surface in the dark. I think that was last year. <br/><br/>I remember one episode where I've later wished I used the Cut-option. A player cut her very RL finger as I entered the room as her in-character superior, but I was to "immersed"/ in my own head space to remember to cut and make sure she was all right. I regret that, but at least I talked with her after the larp (and she said she/it was ok).<br/><br/>I've never been used to having the Cut/Break options present in tabletop play, and the thought at first seems a little alien. (Probably out of some feeling that tabletop is less physically and mentally intense). But it might be a good idea, especially at cons and in other settings where you're playing with people you don't know that well, in order to ensure a safe space. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417086/#Comment_417086" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T04:40:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  4:40AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Johnzo.

In general, we tell people that no explanations are needed, but if they want to share, they are welcome to. It's their choice. <br/><br/>I've seen the X-Card used easily 60-100+ times (I play a lot of games with a lot of people all over the world). Some examples:<br/><br/>- I described an NPC smoking. A player was trying to quit and felt uncomfortable.<br/>- We were playing a modern realistic horror game. Someone introduced funny elves.<br/>- I described plane turbulence. This triggered a player and luckily I stopped asap (we had to stop the game as well) and we did what we could to help the person in question.<br/><br/>Recently a friend brought up that X-Cards and Veils make them feel unsafe. This was the first time I encountered this, but I'm glad I listened, as they had important things to say. For them, techniques like the X-Card sound like a way to prioritize "keeping the game moving" rather than "attending to the needs of the person who's been triggered. It's important to note that uncomfortable and triggered are not the same thing. And there are many different levels to triggered. Another friend who has PTSD once broke down in a game\u2026 which was before we had an X-Card, and honestly\u2026. I don't think the X-Card could of helped in that case because it was something that once triggered, it's already too late (for them specifically). There are a few takeaways here, but I think most valuable is that people are more important than games and the X-Card shouldn't be used to "get past" issues as much as to keep issues for escalating (when possible).<br/><br/>I've also heard that similar tools like Break in various LARPs have been problematic because people either forget to use them (no reminder like a card in the middle of a table with an X on it) or using them puts too much attention on them (you can't simply point to a card or lift it, you need to speak loudly so everyone can hear you). It's further complicated by situations where the point of the game is to experience intense emotions, in some groups, using an X-Card could be seen as a weakness. I'm not sure what I would use in a LARP as an X-Card alternative, but since I'm designing LARPs now, it's something I will think deeply on. <br/><br/>The X-Card can also lead to more intense play. People know they have a communication tool if things go too far, so they may feel more comfortable going farther than they normally would.<br/><br/>As Lizzie says, I find X-Cards to be especially valuable for Story Games where players make up content. It's impossible to fully know what will be in a game before you play, so it helps to have a signaling tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417133/#Comment_417133" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T12:03:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 12:03PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if it were a rule that each player must use the X-card at least once?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417135/#Comment_417135" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T12:08:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 12:08PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What if it were a rule that each player must use the X-card at least once?</blockquote>\nThat sounds terrible to me.

If so, that's very interesting, because that sounds like it is much more common than what I've heard of "Cut" and "Brake" in Nordic larp (and sorry about mixing those up in my earlier post).  <br/><br/>I think it is easier to interrupt a tabletop game than a larp for two reasons.  Larps tend to have more people, so you're stopping a larger social works, and also larps tend to be more continuously in-character, so it is more of an interruption to step out.  Still, it might be interesting to look into what else (if anything) makes it easier to pick up the card.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417137/#Comment_417137" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T12:30:07+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 12:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jhkim, totally agree about LARP! <br/><br/>All those cases are X-Card specific.

They are not. If you believe they are 100% effective they are actually harmful.<br/><br/>I been at a larp where a player who had a latent claustrophobia. She had been a bit uncomfortable in small spaces before, but hasn't realized she actually had a phobia. She played a thief and her character was shut into an earth cellar before the trial. When she was locked in the character was played upset and angry, slamming at the doors and shouting. Then the player suddenly slipped into a full-blown panic attack. It happened so fast she didn't think about using the safe word, to have them open up the cellar door. She started screaming and slamming the door in wild panic. Somehow the guards realized that something was wrong, opened up the earth cellar door realized that something really was wrong and let her out and helped her calm down.<br/><br/>If the players had believed that safe-words was 100% effective they would have ignored the impulse that something really as wrong ("Because if something really as wrong she would have used the safe-word" ) and wouldn't have checked in on her.<br/><br/>Safewords/X-cards are not 100% effective. But neither is they 0%  effective. They have effect both as a communicative tool (in this game we will respect if someone isn't comfortable with something, etc) even when they aren't used during play. See Bri great post that descibe how they made game safer for her even if she didn't have to use them. <a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/01/finding-my-o-with-the-x-card/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/01/finding-my-o-with-the-x-card/</a> And sometimes Safe-words/X-cards are used and people are grateful that the rules was there.<br/><br/>Safewords/X-cards are tools that need to be combined with other tools to create a safe enviroment.<br/><br/>In my example above the game also had rule that said guard not allowed to walk away from a tied up or locked in person. They need to stay close to the prisoner. Both for physical safety reason (a tied up person or a lock up person can't get away from an aggressive swarms of bees without help) and for psychological safety.<br/><br/>When the one safety tool failed (the player panicked to fast to remember to use a safe-word), the second safety tool worked. <br/><br/>Even of the guards was on the other side of the door they where so close by that they could tell the difference between her playing upset and banging at the door in character, and her banging at the door because she was having a panic attack and help her out of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417148/#Comment_417148" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T14:12:42+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  2:12PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting a few things from this thread:<br/><br/>a) I should probably introduce X-cards as a method in my own games.<br/>b) They can be used to ban "funny elves" - sing hosannah!

Don't do this. This was my worst mistake as an organizer, ever... Ever. <br/><br/><b>My biggest larp mistake</b><br/>I was one of the organizers at a fantasy LARP, and was the one that held the briefing for the Roman/Nazi inspired group. The group would have prisoners and slaves and there would be a lot of hard play. We talked about safe words and not pushing anyone yourself or anyone else into situation they wasn't comfortable with.<br/><br/>Then I made a mistake. There where 60 people in the group, standing in the circle. Some as young as 15. For some it was their first larp, and others had just larped a few times before.<br/><br/>I asked them "Let's go round the circle so we can say what sort of things we would be comfortable with, and what we wouldn't be comfortable with."<br/><br/>The first one the answered was a 17 year old with not much larp experience. "Erm. I think I can handle anything." Then standing next to him was an even younger larper that also said. "I can handle anything." And then the third person said... "I think I can handle anything too."<br/><br/>And so did everyone else, because the first few person answering had created a norm. It took some really expediences larps to brake the pattern and really speak up and draw some real boarders. During the game, people in that camp played to hard, pushing each other to far, perhaps much because everyone said that they could handle anything.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Well...

I wouldn't do this for 60 people - there are way too many people to keep track of and because it takes a while, there is a lot of pressure to be quick and simple about what you say.  60 people is a very impersonal setting for any actual discussion.)  <br/><br/>I've seen the behavior you're talking about before.  I don't think it means that one should avoid having players speak, but rather to properly set up the context in which they speak.  Leading by example is one way, and choosing the first people to say things is one issue you remind me of.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417160/#Comment_417160" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T15:18:29+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  3:18PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great! <br/><br/>In that discussion I also think it important to stress that you don't know before the game what you actually will be comfortable with.

We're not going anywhere that is obviously rough from the outset, but we acknowledge that sometimes you can step on a landmine without knowing it. In place of a safe-word, we have the enthusiastic consent of the participants. Its not "tell me when to stop" it's "how do you think about this?" If the answer is anything but "fuck yes!" then you need to stop and negotiate. Whereas when the intention is to go somewhere difficult, and we all know this and have carefully negotiated from the outset, we start slow and work our way into the scene. The safe-word emboldens us, allows us to go places together that we wouldn't have gone alone, knowing that if we need to stop we will be able to and seek solace and support.<br/><br/>But I think mixing the two is a bad idea, because it can potentially introduce difficult elements that have not been negotiated for, but appear invited by the presence of a safety net. To be clear, I believe the <i>negotiation</i> is the important part; the safety net is just a mechanism by which to implement the work we have already done to sharpen our focus on the care, enjoyment, and wellbeing of our fellow players. The understanding must always be from the outset that even though we have a "safe"-word, what we are doing when we play rough is never truly "safe". So with this in mind we must find ways to understand and care for one another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417184/#Comment_417184" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T20:22:40+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  8:22PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts:<br/><br/>- I haven't thought this thru too much, but had the idea that a game designer can bounce between  two poles a) nerfing the game content to not offend everyone and taking total responsibility for game content and b) saying that all players are hardcore individually responsible for their own psychological well-being.<br/><br/>- I wrote about larp safety for the (free! downloadable!) 2013 Knutebook (<a href="http://knutepunkt.org/static/documents/Habitual.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://knutepunkt.org/static/documents/Habitual.pdf</a>). For my piece, I called up a neuropsychologist and asked her to evaluate some of the current tactics, and I talked with her about why people don't use cut and brake rules. (And the anal copyeditor in me gently reminds the team that it's usually "brake" not "break," as in "this level of intensity is good but don't increase it and let me play myself out of the scene.") The bottom line is that everyone has different vulnerabilities to certain topics, and this is why safety measures are a complicated, sticky wicket. You can read what I learned from her -- and more! -- in the piece I wrote for this year's (free, downloadable) Knutebook.<br/><br/>But in general, yes, it's muy complicado. And I agree that giving players the tools for negotiation and a felicitous atmosphere are probably a good idea. I think there was a panel by Emma Wieslander and Eleanor Saitta on teaching players to negotiate with each other at Knutepunkt this year, but alas, I wasn't able to make it.

If you know your game will involve excessive gore and sexual assault, it is important to state that up front so people have the info they need to opt in or out of your game.<br/><br/>Additionally, I've found that a lot of the content people object to, is specifically content that may be inflicted on their characters. Plenty of people are ok with fiction dealing with sensitive topics like sexual assault, as long as their character is not in any danger of sexual assault themselves. I find being clear what people are ok with in setting vs. ok with for their characters can be an important distinction. <br/><br/>There was an infamous game where a female player said up front, "I don't want non-consensual sex in this game" (and it was a comedy game dealing with silly topics where none of us imagine such content would be included)... and then she proceeded to attempt to rape an NPC! What she meant was, "I don't want my character to experience non-consensual sex".<br/><br/>I also really like mechanics like Monsterhearts where the results of rolling are often decided by the person affected. If you roll a 7-9 to Turn Someone On, the person affected decides if they have sex with you, give you what they think you want, or gives you a String. In Monsterhearts, you can also spend a String to offer someone an XP in exchange for taking a specific action BUT the person affected decides. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417275/#Comment_417275" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T02:09:40+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  2:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Norwegian larpwright Eirik Fatland with<a href="http://larpwright.efatland.com/?p=339" rel="nofollow"> a blogpost on safewords in role playing games</a>, more specifically "Cut" and "Brake" in larps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417289/#Comment_417289" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T06:03:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  6:03AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.

I'm wondering: what have people tried? How has that worked?<br/><br/>Here's the dilemma as I see it: You can get people used to saying "cut" and "brake," but just mandating that people use it once in a workshop isn't enough, because forcing people to say these words doesn't actually replicate the circumstances under which you'd want to use them -- when you're feeling that things are too much or going in a direction you aren't comfortable with. I think replicating that in a workshop is...risky...and sort of obviates the purpose of the words right there in the workshop. <br/><br/>Then again, maybe it's better to get that out in the open during the workshop where the organizers are watching.<br/><br/>(A side issue is that we're still getting used to workshops over here in the states, and I think that because of that, they tend to be compressed, so organizers have to make judgement decisions about how much time everything gets, and what's truly essential to play. Helping people learn to love workshops might help loosen up the time schedule a bit, I suspect.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417313/#Comment_417313" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T09:09:57+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  9:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2013 9:10AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lizzie "workshops, WTF" is a whole 'nother thread waiting to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417468/#Comment_417468" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T00:13:39+00:00" title="June 29, 2013 12:13AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that this exists because:<br/><br/>1. I have a lot of anxiety regarding protocol in social situations. I mean A LOT. If I don't know what the local protocol is for something and I can't figure it out, I freeze up.<br/><br/>2. I'm very fond of the Refuge in Audacity (wherein horrible content justifies itself by just being as horrible as you can make it) and Crossing the Line Twice (wherein content crosses the line into offensiveness then crosses another line into humor) tropes, and sometimes I worry that others don't appreciate this. <br/><br/> 3.\t I like games like Sorcerer and the Rustbelt (which is mine) in which you push the characters against the wall so hard that they are forced to find a way to break through it, but I always end up worrying that I took it too far. <br/><br/> 4.\t I have auditory processing disorder, which, among other things, makes it very difficult to catch non verbal cues, because so much of my brain power is usually tied up in figuring out what *words* a person just said that I literally can't pay attention to much else. <br/> <br/> 5.\t  There is content that really bothers me sometimes, but it's not the kind of things that usually bother people and it's hard to talk about. (As an example, I don't think I will ever be able to play Nicotine Girls, even though it's a masterwork and I'm glad that it exists. It would probably bring me to tears and I'd rather not do that, thanks, nor explain why I'm crying.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417473/#Comment_417473" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T03:56:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  3:56AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2013 3:57AM by Graham.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People who have used the X-card: could you talk me through how it <i>empowers</i> players to state their boundaries?<br/><br/>One of my worries is that, in the main, the X-card would be used by those with the confidence to use it.

The option of how to interact helps with empowerment.

In rare occasions I will ask a friend to use it on me. <br/><br/>But I do know of at least 2 instances where even with an X-Card, a player still felt too uncomfortable using it. Later they told me they weren't sure if their concerns and feelings were worth voicing. <br/><br/>One thing I've sometime done as well... take a break in the middle.

All things that require speaking up, etc are easier for the people that have a easy time for those who can speak up, are used to speak up, are used to being listened to and respected, for those who have enough status to speak up, for people who belong to the social groups/roles where it okay to speak up etc.<br/><br/>A tool can't magically fix that. No single technique fixes such deep rooted issues.<br/><br/>But hopefully it can lower the threshold and help somewhat And I think X-cards/safewords can do that is used and presented and supported in a good way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417604/#Comment_417604" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T11:51:44+00:00" title="July  1, 2013 11:51AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the techniques for dealing with less confident players aren't really covered by the use or non-use of the X-Card or anything similar. I think less confident players need smaller, more intimate games. GM + 2-3 is good, or a GM-less game of 4. And not just few people, but trusted people, people who are already friends.<br/><br/>It's our job as GMs/hosts/facilitators/etc to make the environment as welcoming as possible. That's what the X-Card, workshops, etc, are great for. Also anti-harassment policies, and any sort of effort in general to make gaming spaces more diverse.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, we're not psychologists (most of us, anyway, and even psychologists who game aren't going to be treating people while rolling dice). At a certain point, especially with adults, people have to take responsibility for their own needs. I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for people with social anxiety disorder, for example. It's a huge burden to bear. If I was gaming with someone who suffered from that particular issue, and they articulated particular ways I could help accommodate them, then I would do it, no question. But someone who doesn't articulate their needs, and just sits there (or whatever)\u2014it's tough to really help them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417605/#Comment_417605" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T13:18:33+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  1:18PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, no.<br/><br/>The people you most want to speak up are the people who will be less confident about speaking up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417607/#Comment_417607" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T13:20:08+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  1:20PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham: Yeah.

The exercise let's the receiver specify when and if the two players make contact. They get to assert boundaries multiple times in a judgment-free space, and both players develop the expectations that boundaries will be set and respected. The primary benefits of the exercise appear to be <i>normalization</i> and <i>trust-building</i>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417878/#Comment_417878" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T14:25:35+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  2:25PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that makes total sense to me.

The group leader keeps their eyes open. <br/><br/>"Put your hand down if you're not comfortable with X"<br/>"Put your hand down if you're not comfortable with Y"<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Then at the end you have everyone put their hands down and open their eyes and you announce some things that won't be in the game.<br/><br/>You can also do this with MPAA ratings if that's a good shorthand.

It's not meant to be comprehensive, but to at least give folks an informed understanding of what they're doing if they sign up for a game.<br/><br/>Something like:<br/><br/>[the game pitch:] "Alright, I'm going to offer Durance. It's a game about life and looming uncertainty on an imperial prison planet. It's an allegory for the history of the Australian penal colony - but, you know, in space. Expect betrayal, drama, and pathos."<br/><br/>[the content flag:] "Since we're talking about a prison planet, the game necessarily includes prisoners in atrocious living conditions. We're likely to see some combination of abuses of authority, armed conflict, murder, and extortion. Think gritty."<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>The x-card is still very much in effect. Flagging for content is a tool for expectation management, for informing consent, and for helping people find games where they're less likely to encounter triggering material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418032/#Comment_418032" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T11:27:39+00:00" title="July  9, 2013 11:27AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2013 11:49AM by madunkieg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops.

I think most of what I would say has been said already, but to summarise:<br/><br/><b>Objective:</b> to create safe spaces, and to prevent uncomfortable bleed.<br/><b>Solutions:</b> <br/>1.\tUsing the X-card, either one per table or- an intriguing suggestion- one per player.<br/>2.\tHaving an L&amp;V discussion prior to the game.<br/>3.\tHaving \u2018safe words\u2019 like cut and break etc.<br/>4.\tHaving a kind of 'warm-up' exercise or workshop pre-game.<br/><br/>I'll briefly tackle all these in turn.<br/><br/>I\u2018ve never used the X-card myself (hence why I posted about it here, to find out how it works, or doesn\u2019t) so thanks to all those who have done for feedback about their experiences with it. The positives appear to me to be that anyone can use it at any time without saying why they\u2019re uncomfortable and with what; it obviates the need to have an L&amp;V discussion (see later for possible negatives of that), it\u2019s an easy thing to incorporate into one\u2019s facilitation trick bag; crucially, it doesn\u2019t have to involve speech- very important IMO for players uncomfortable with articulating their discomfort.<br/><br/>Possible negatives: it\u2019s been suggested above that if it\u2019s so easy to halt the game when uncomfortable topics are raised, then other players could feel bolder in doing so, thus it\u2019s paradoxically <i>more </i>likely that such topics will crop up. Whether or not this is true, and, if it is, whether it\u2019s actually a negative, I\u2019m not sure, only people\u2019s individual experience will tell, but overall I think the positives outweigh this negative, if it is one.<br/><br/>Lines and Veils discussion. Following a lot of talk on the subject over the last year or so, we\u2019ve moved away from this in the UK, mainly because it was felt that to ask someone to flag their triggers before a game marked them out as someone who isn\u2019t comfortable with x, y or z, which people are understandably reluctant to do. The solution has been generally to say to players something along the lines of \u2018If you\u2019re uncomfortable with something just say so and I\u2019ll stop the game\u2019. The main negative IMO, and where I believe the X-card scores over this approach, is, as I said above, you actually have to speak up, and several posters in this thread have addressed the problem a lot of people have with speaking up. <br/><br/>So, better to speak up in-game if a trigger topic is raised? Well, maybe not. When I ran my MLwM scenario at UK Games Expo in May, one of the players, who had been reffing another game earlier and who after hearing about my game decided to give it a try, observed that if you have to speak up when an uncomfortable topic arises it\u2019s almost too late, the damage having been done. So maybe back to L&amp;V? And on speaking up, a quick word on \u2018safe words\u2019- again, I think the X-card is better than using specific words, for reasons outlined above, unless I\u2019ve misunderstood, and  these words are for use by the facilitator, not the players?<br/><br/>Onto warm-up exercises and workshopping. Again, correct me if I\u2019m off beam here, but I think the point of warm-up exercises is to get all the players- who may not know each other from Adam- to feel comfortable with each other before the actual game starts, on the principle presumably that a lot of the difficulty with bleed stems from people\u2019s unwillingness to open up about their innermost feelings in front of total strangers. The main problem I see with workshopping, which in some ways is a more efficacious solution than warm-ups- given that they probably include warm-ups- is time.

If the X-card also enables players to say things like 'I'm uncomfortable with all this horsing around, can we be serious please?' it means that it's not just for uncomfortable bleed, which I think makes it easier for folks to use it for that purpose- because the other players don't necessarily know that that's why it's being used- and this in turn takes the pressure off the user.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418433/#Comment_418433" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T09:44:33+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  9:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Slight necro, but as threadstarter I feel a duty to kind of pull the strands together a bit.

The biggest problem I've experienced in my games is players munchkinning in a way that other players find disempowering. I think the advantage over the x-card over lines and veils is that it can be for anything, while lines and veils suggests some kind of in-game issue being introduced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18533/using-the-x-card" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18533/using-the-x-card" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18533/using-the-x-card/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18533%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18533%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
