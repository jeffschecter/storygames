They have asked me to GM 3-4 Cthulhu adventures, before they leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone, was like, "Yeah, Cthulhu."  And I could see the looks of nostalgia and sadness in their eyes; knowing that Cthulhu would be a fitting end to a great gaming group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to let them down.  I really want these adventures to rock their socks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the problem: After playing games with rules that give Players heavy Author stance powers, I have developed a distaste for games that require strict GM authority, illusionism and task only resolutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I know these guys, and I'm pretty sure they want the illusion of mystery. This takes GM skill, skill in disguising when you block and reveal information-- without regard to the dice.  Doing it in such a way that the Players think they are solving the mystery, however, is hard.  One slip up and they know you're railroading.  Slip up the other way, and players get frustrated and reckless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty sure my skills in this type of GMing were 1) never that good in the first place and 2) probably atrophied over the past 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point I thought the game Afraid would solve this problem. After playtesting it several times it just didn't work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have toyed with various game mechanics of my own to address my problems.  I play tested them twice-- and all the players (a different group) were thrown off.  It required a different approach to the game, which I don't think they were ready for or comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, part of me wants to try something close to the rules I've written for horror/mystery.  Alas, I don't want this game to be a lame send off to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my questions here are:<br/>\nHas anyone tried Trail of Cthulhu, and will that game satisfy the desire of my group for more old style task-based mystery investigations?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat tweaks to Dead of Night, could I add to make it more Lovecraftian? (I haven't read this game in awhile, and I'm not sure the group would be happy about trying a different system).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I bite the bullet, and try to GM the old way (with the old Chaosium rules) that I don't care for, do you have any tips and suggestions? (this is probably what I'm thinking of doing -- because it will result in no resistance from the group).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145866/#Comment_145866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T14:50:44+00:00" title="May 24, 2008  2:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Trail of Cthulhu is a great game, better for investigation than Call of Cthulhu. Whether or not it will be scarier is hard to say. It's more streamlined, and it allows for a bit more player control. My suggestion for you would be two things though:<br><br>1. First, simply tell your players about your concerns, pretty much the same thing you wrote here. That will take the pressure off to make the "perfect experience" (it doesn't exist, btw) and let them know to be more understanding about the whole thing. You might be worrying about something that isn't an issue, or they may have an idea that you haven't thought about.<br><br>2. Read Trail of Cthulhu (or Unknown Armies, or Dread, etc) yourself. I won't be able to sell you on the game better than the game itself. If you're jazzed to play it, that will translate to a better time for all, especially you. And a further note on that: don't forget about your own fun. If you're not having a good time trying to make the game great for everyone else, odds are they won't be either.<br><br>If you happen to live in Sacramento, you're free to borrow my copy of Trail of Cthulhu. I think it's keen.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145874/#Comment_145874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T15:16:36+00:00" title="May 24, 2008  3:16PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2008 3:17PM by Graham.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trail of Cthulhu basically builds illusionism into the game: the PCs are guaranteed to uncover the mystery. It has an old school feel, when you play it: so, yes, to answer your question, it'd satisfy your players' urge for an old-school mystery. It's a great game, definitely worth a try.<br><br>Dead of Night's a good call, too. You could tweak it by awarding Survival Points for Lovecraftian cliches rather than B-movie cliches. That'd be quite cool. However, the mechanics don't really deal with uncovering mysteries.<br><br>What else? There's UnSpeakable, the InSpectres variant, but there the players make up the answers to the mystery, which doesn't sound like what you want.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145891/#Comment_145891" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T17:50:08+00:00" title="May 24, 2008  5:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rather than go back to the Chaosium rules, you might want to consider <a href="http://www.nemesis-system.com/up-download-files/nemesis/details.html" rel="nofollow">Nemesis</a> if you run it traditionally.<br><br>It's basically the one roll engine (from Godlike, Wild Talents, and Reign) with the Unknown Armies madness meter system attached.

Just got done running the game for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt went really, really well.  I had the old Afraid adventure (monster) I'd tried awhile back.  I just created Benefits from the clues I had already had and fleshed out a few pieces to make it fit to the new mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBenefits drive the game, i think.  And coming up with logical, fun benefits is tough -- but I got the swing of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSense Danger was an odd skill to deal with, but I think I have it figured out.<br/>\nI couldn't find the equivalent of "fast talk," for the system-- but I'm pretty sure there is an associated skill for that type of manipulation.  I just had a hard time finding it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy one complaint is the format of the book.  Information is sort of hard to find. Often it is wrapped up in rather complicated sentences. Granted, I was trying to read it quickly, in small chunks, when I could the find time.  Usually I can skim a system and get the gist of it, but this one, for some reason --which I think was purely a formating issue -- made it hard for me to absorb. (ie, references to rules not yet explained found early in the character creation section).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a quick reference sheet for the Gumshoe system out there?<br/>\nThe system is quite simple, but it just doesn't come off that way as it was written.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Afraid monster creation rules were easy to adapt to the ToC mechanic.  After each step, just create a clue, a benefit and describe what sort of scene is required.  It took me only about 20 min to polish up the monster I had and it ran well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146825/#Comment_146825" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T04:06:55+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  4:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 4:07AM by Graham.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sense Danger's an interesting skill. I think it arises because all the rolls are in the players' hands. So the monster doesn't roll a Sneak roll: instead, the player rolls Sense Danger. (In other words, whenever you feel you should be rolling for a monster skill, look for the inverse player skill instead.)<br><br>Fast Talk: yeah. Interesting. I can't think of a direct equivalent either. There's no reason you couldn't just have a Fast Talk skill, though.

The system seems to match the point of play, much better than CoC. It might be hard work to write the adventures, though, since I don't think they've released any yet. Call of Cthulhu, on the other hand, has hundreds of ready-written adventures. <br>\n<br>\nHere's my problem with CoC: I hate the system (so I guess I'd better give my character an 80% in Library Use and an 80% in Handgun...uh, again....), I hate to read the adventures because they all seem totally railroaded, and I hate the fact that if anyone's played the adventure before you can't run it because it always happens in the same one way, and everyone probably dies in the end anyway. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, every time I play it, I have a blast. I can live with being railroaded in a game where you're always at risk of real WTF?! moments out of nowhere. If you ask me, it's a game that relies entirely on the adventures available for it. And there are some beautiful adventures out there. And for me, the slightly crazy system just makes it even scarier, because at its best it's just a system that gives you an excuse to be role-paying. As in, like, we're rolling dice, so this isn't just a ghost story. I guess it depends on your group, though, and your GM.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146899/#Comment_146899" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T11:43:22+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 11:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>First, simply tell your players about your concerns, pretty much the same thing you wrote here.
