An amazing game. I was a little rusted and after two sessions I'm still relearning how to properly bang the players and how to create a good pacing. But the rules are helping and the game is working pretty well. A plot is arising with minimum effort and the game is providing a subtle but strong feeling of distrust and wrongness on the characters. Nice tension and hard scenes.<br/><br/>My question: How promotion rules work? <br/>I have the Second Attempt version. <br/><br/>1) On page 9 it says that a character earns a commendation point on each 6 rolled while in target heart rate. If an agent earns 10 commendation points during a mission she gains a new Talent.<br/>But target-rate is on a range of 40 to 50 bpm, depending on the character age. It is not possible to roll more than seven or eight 6s without going over the target rate, and that would be an incredible lucky thing. We have got between 3 and 5 commendation points per character and mission. Once, a character got 6 points during one mission, but he was really lucky (for commendation point of view, on the other hand he did only 3 rolls before going over the target rate).<br/>May I assume that the player should tally all the commendation points earned during missions and get a talent each time she accumulates 10, 20, 30, etc...?<br/><br/>2) When you have all the talents within an attribute, or one talent on each attribute you promote. It says you need at least 30 commendation points. But you already begin the game with one talent. A couple of talents more on the same attribute and you should be done (20 commendation points). <br/><br/>Any advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60121/#Comment_60121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T08:55:15+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  8:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I've played it, commendation points from a mission that are not spent carry over to the start of the next dive.
