It's solicited advertising. "Tell me why I should try out this game! Tell me why I should *buy* this game."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's better, IMO, than me simply coming on here and putting what amounts to an Ad up for my games. It's functionally similar, in that I'm trying to sell you my game (even if it's free) but in the "Sell me on..." threads, you're asking me, and others, to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said.. I agree with the sentiment expressed in the subject line. It's been a little excessive lately, IMO. But hey, it's easy to skip threads that don't interest me, so it's little more than an excuse to roll my eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187180/#Comment_187180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T11:29:14+00:00" title="January  9, 2009 11:29AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>I notice that the threads actually aren't "sell me on" but "Recommend a system for..."</blockquote>\nActually, when I use them, I totally mean "sell me on", or at least "tell me what you like about...". But "Sell me on Empire of Dust" is easier to type than "Tell me a few things that you really like about Empire of Dust". Especially since, in both cases, the end result is that the thread poster ends up buying the product if suffiiciently teased/explained".<br><br>The only problem we've had lately is Filip's use of the thread format, which has been "recommend me a system based on these extremely fine and minute guidelines".

That, and I think that if you need to be "sold" on an RPG, you probably don't want it anyway. Either the concept of a game excites you or it doesn't, and you want to play it or you don't.<br/><br/>That, and it gives me RPG.net flashbacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187642/#Comment_187642" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T19:49:45+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  7:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The PTSD of individual members notwithstanding..<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't the purchase of an RPG kind of a big deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are masses of great RPGs out there that I haven't bought. Some I am almost rabidly enthusiastic about. But I haven't bought them, nor do I see myself buying them in the foreseeable future because I don't know when I'll get a chance to play them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to GenCon, I was very much in a "Sell Me" mode. With very few exceptions, I didn't buy a game I hadn't played at least briefly first. One of the exceptions, 3:16, I asked for assurances that I would enjoy it, mostly in joking mode. John Harper told me that if I didn't like it after he ran me through a game, he'd buy my copy. I totally wouldn't have sold it to him, partly because I believe in making choices and abiding by the results, good or bad, and partially because Gregor signed my copy, and how weird would that be?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wanted to buy some other games. I wanted to buy MLwM, because the game sounds fun, and has influenced my game design efforts despite the fact that I've never played it. There were others, too, but I hadn't played them, and my budget was limited. I know, know, KNOW that I won't regret purchasing MLwM, if for no other reason than to read it, but I wasn't sold on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike Alex Cherry, I do not have a massive collection of RPGs taking up most of a wall of my room. Every book I purchase is one I expect to use, or at least really want to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom Line: Don't sell me on a game you don't think I should buy. Don't read a Sell Me thread unless you're interested in selling it, or interested in being sold on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you think I've got a sense of entitlement because I may or may not ask you to "sell me on" something, you ain't seen nothin'. Get me started on how ungrateful people are for the freedoms they enjoy in America. THAT's a sense of entitlement. <img alt=":grin:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/grin.png" title=":grin:"/>:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187650/#Comment_187650" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T20:41:44+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  8:41PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Isn't the purchase of an RPG kind of a big deal?</blockquote>\nQuerying the internet about an RPG you are interested in is one thing (IMO).

It's at least somewhat of a big deal to that person at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf answering the call to sell someone is too much mental effort, then don't. I personally think that perhaps you're not exerting enough mental effort on the purchase of your games. Which means precisely nothing to you, unless you choose to make it so.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I want to be sold on a game. I don't want to buy it simply because it caught my eye, or on a whim. When I buy a game, I want to be 100% sold on playing it.
