If you like something, use it.<br/><br/>Also:<br/>"Hack" is something where you take an existing game and change some small bits of it to do something else. Like "hacks" of the old DOOM computer game that reskinned it to play ALIENS (the movie). So, like, "Using Dead Inside or Dust Devils to play Jedi from Star Wars". It may or may not involve adding house rules or changing how some rules work.<br/>But it's been also used as a catch-all for a conglomerate of ideas pulled and jury-rigged together into a huge gleaming pile, like the "Red Box Hack" by Eric Provost.<br/><br/>But the mantra again is "aim to make something fun, don't aim to Just Be Original". Original ideas develop in playtest as ways to fix problems that your game exhibits in play (or where it doesn't meet your goals, etc).<br/><br/>Oh, and welcome to Story Games!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306738/#Comment_306738" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T01:43:10+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  1:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steal from everyone.

Otherwise, I don't think there's hard-and-fast rules about it, just perceptions about what's derivative and what's influence and what's novel.

What seems, to you, like a hack of Another Game, may seem to others like a new game <i>based</i> on Another Game.<br/><br/>I still think A Taste For Murder is a basically a hack of The Shab Al-Hiri Roach.
