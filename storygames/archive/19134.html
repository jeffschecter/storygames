So change it we should!<br/><br/>Brainstorming, I can think of a few kinds of game names.<br/><br/><b>1. What the PCs do</b><br/><br/>I like this best.  <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is a good example.<br/><br/><b>2. What makes the game mechanics special?</b><br/><br/>Perhaps <i>GURPS</i> is the classic example.<br/><br/><b>3. What exemplifies the setting?</b><br/><br/>Dungeons?  Dragons?  Cthulhu?  Toons?<br/><br/><b>4. Which type of people would enjoy the game?</b><br/><br/>I cannot think of examples off the top of my head, but consider a game title with phrases such as "for kids" or "solo PC" or "moral conundrums".<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>What else makes a game's name?<br/><br/>Any specific suggestions?<br/><br/>I would love to use <i>Skills Talents Powers</i> which blends the game mechanics and setting nicely.  But too many things have the initials STP.<br/><br/>I am thinking of <i>Upholding Power</i> which could work if I more strongly suggest that a Player's first PC be a <a href="http://davidvs.net/name/champions.shtml" rel="nofollow">Champion</a>.  Is such a suggestion more limiting or helpful?<br/><br/>At the end of December I had ideas involving "something something For Everyone" but did not write them down and have now forgotten them.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427057/#Comment_427057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T12:26:52+00:00" title="January 12, 2014 12:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I like names that give some clue about what the game world is like.

For example, in rpg culture you have the option of communicating straightforward, honest, no-frills adventure game by using a conventional name ("Something &amp; Something" being the parodic extreme), or you can communicate emotionally ambitious hipsterism by having a weird, punchy name or an excessively florid one. Of course there are also other, lesser communication possibilities aside from that big continuum; e.g. adding "System" at the end of the name can place you in the generic/universal end of the pool, with strong trad expectations.<br/><br/>(A theory on the above observation: trad games tend to sell themselves on being generic and flexible tools, perhaps oriented to a specific genre. Prog games tend to sell themselves on being unique and specific. For this reason the trad game is more likely to have a generic name vaguely indicative of a genre of adventure fiction, while the prog game is more likely to have a name akin to the name of a movie or a novel.)<br/><br/>What is your game about? If you've got an elevator pitch, it'd make it easier to offer concrete suggestions. "Narrative Adventures Made Easy" isn't the most selling name ever, but if the game is in the generic tradition and doesn't have anything more compelling to it aside from being easy and being about narratives, then that might well be the best name for it. Truth in advertising, I say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427077/#Comment_427077" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T21:29:18+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  9:29PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've forgotten the expected player arc.

There's no tried-and-true way to get a perfect name. Some awesome names are surprise flukes that nobody saw coming.<br/><br/>Jason's particularly spot-on with "Choose a name that makes people want to learn more." <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is a really cool name because it invites questions. Why are there dogs in a vineyard? Why is there a vineyard? Why are there dogs? It doesn't even tell the casual observer much about what the game is; it only makes sense in hindsight. I will also point out that the name rings of religious (especially Christian) terminology, primarily because of the use of "vineyard". It brings to mind phrases like "casting pearls before swine". An RPG gamer will look at that and go "Why is this an RPG? What's that all about?"<br/><br/>Also, read your name aloud. This will do <b>wonders</b> to make it sound interesting. Have someone read it back to you. It also helps you see how easy the game is to soundbite and be remembered. "Fiasco" is instantly memorable. "Lacuna" is instantly memorable. "Monsterhearts" is instantly memorable. If the average gamer hears someone talking about the game, will they recall what the name was, so that they can Google-search it later? A great way to ensure this is to pick a word that's easy to pronounce but at the same time evocative either in sound or meaning. Mashing up two words (<i>Monsterhearts</i> comes to mind, as does Mythender) is a great way to create this distinctiveness, by the by. Don't pick a word that could be easily misspelled.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons, I think, that "GURPS" works--not because the title is informative (it's just an acronym) but because it's a distinctive sound. Gurps. Gurps. Gurps gurps gurps. I gurpsly gurpsed a gurps of gurpsy gurps into my gurps. Easy to pronounce, it rolls off the tongue with a certain memorable cadence. And it doesn't match an existing English word. (On that note, now "GURPS" sounds like a sci-fi pseudo-profanity. :-P Gurps you!)<br/><br/>Generic titles are not good, I will say that much. The reason something like GURPS gets off the hook on this is because the acronym itself isn't generic, and nobody ever talks about it as the Generic Universal RolePlaying System.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427101/#Comment_427101" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T11:58:22+00:00" title="January 13, 2014 11:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generic is super bad for names.

But narrowing it in a way that intrigues and invites those who make up the potential audience in.<br/><br/>A game that claims that it is for everybody is really going to be for nobody. Because roleplaying games don't reach the "everybody" audience and people interested in roleplaying games aren't interested in being everybody. So unless you actually think you've designed a game that will actually appeal to everybody (and you have not - the vast majority of my coworkers would be turned off by your game as soon as they see the setting, even the ones who enjoyed watching movies with hobbits) then generic, everybody-focused branding is doing you a disservice.<br/><br/>In a game where many hundreds of people have written games for what is ultimately a smallish and flooded niche market, you need to spend a lot of time thinking about what really makes your game unique and awesome. Somewhere in that area of setting, mechanics, tone, etc. should be an evocative name.<br/><br/>If you don't yet know what it is that really makes your game unique and awesome and evocative and you don't have the words to express that clearly, your game just isn't done yet. But you know that at least on some level, because you're here asking this question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427106/#Comment_427106" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-13T13:09:32+00:00" title="January 13, 2014  1:09PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Generic is super bad for names.

I actually had a friend feel uncomfortable about the name. Many folks encouraged me to keep the name though, because it really served as the elevator pitch in three words. I don't even remember where or how I came up with the title, but it probably sells the game more than any thing else that I have done. When someone hears it, they pretty much instantly decide whether it is something they might be interested in or not.<br/><br/>But no pressure!<br/><br/>Don't overthink it. Seriously, Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the classic title that others try to mimic, even though I've probably played more D&amp;D games without dungeons or dragons in them. I agree that NAME probably leaves something to be desired, especially if there is a built-in setting. As a generic system name? Maybe.<br/><br/>Other titles may not have the same kind of energy, but your game isn't going to be a successful or failure based on it alone.<br/><br/>Here is a suggestion. Make it singular, fitting that the game is about one hero's adventures (i.e. instead of Lords of Fae - how about Lord of Fae?) And actually, I dig the thing you have in the end about Heroic Occasions.

It does stand out, highlight a key feature of the setting, and is somewhat compelling.  It does not pass the Google test with flying colors, but is not miserable there.<br/><br/>Yesterday I read through the comments up through January 13th, and was struck by Adam Dray's compliment that I have some skill at smithing single words.  I had been focusing on phrases for a name, not single words.  So I spent some time with prayer, ten-year-old port, several appropriate root words, and Wikipedia's list of suffixes and came up with <i>Heroloquy</i> (speaking as a hero) or <i>Heronomy</i> (the customs of heroes).<br/><br/>Those seemed ideal.  Short, memorable, Google-worthy, and referring to what is special in both the mechanics (solo protagonist) and setting (how the Powers make the word conducive for heroism).  However, I recognize that I have an above-average tolerance for cheesiness and worry they might provoke a grimace instead of curiosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427290/#Comment_427290" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T21:05:49+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  9:05PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Google-worthiness is generally overrated, it's much more important to be appealing to actual people. The big marketing thresholds for indie rpgs are <i>not</i> in between getting a person intrigued and having him find your website, it's in hooking that interest in the first place. Nobody's going to decide to google your game's name (and just that, with no context terms like "rpg" or "DavidVS" or something) and then just give up because that phrase exists somewhere in the Internet not under your control. That's an artificial concern translated directly from entirely different types of business.<br/><br/>These invented word names evoke hipster fantasy to me: something neat, strange, probably urban, peculiarly aesthetic, narrowly focused. Something created by Jonathan Walton, in a word. For me personally, better than "NAME" (that's not a very appealing name at all for a game, I think) but worse than "Nine Powers" or "Grimm Journey". Those latter ones have the advantage of directly evoking adventure fantasy, which apparently appeals to me more on a gut level. Of course the actual product has to match the name, so whatever the game is like, that's what the name should be like as well. So if your game is more like Dreaming Crucible, then "Heroloquy" might be good, while if it's like Burning Wheel, then "Nine Powers" has more punch to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427293/#Comment_427293" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-16T21:37:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2014  9:37PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Heronomy" doesn't grab me by itself, but it does make me wonder what the word means, which means you've got my attention long enough to read a subtitle or back cover blurb.

I had been thinking about "Vying Powers" or "Conflicting Powers" as references to both opposed skill checks (game mechanics) and the nine Powers (setting).  But "Nine Powers" is indeed more catchy.<br/><br/>Tangentially, I've grown fond of the word "ventures" which emphasizes risk.  (But yesterday I could not find any good suffixes for it.)  I like how it sounds.  But in print it for some reason <i>looks</i> like "vultures" when I scan quickly.  So <i>Heroloquy: Solo Ventures and Nine Powers</i> jumps out like a Greek myth about super-vultures, not a RPG.<br/><br/>It's late.  I'm rambling.  Hopefully I am at least entertaining.<br/><br/>I am still unsure whether recommending a PC's relationship to the Powers is more helpful guidance or needlessly limiting.  A byline such as "Questing for Nine Powers" or "Pawn of Nine Powers" is more attractive because it is specific.  But I have not put any PC job description in the setting aside from the expectation of a heroic protagonist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427320/#Comment_427320" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T10:00:16+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 10:00AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using variations on the word Hero when naming an RPG has the disadvantage that it a naming space that is crowded by heavy hitters already. The Hero/Champions game (one of the top 5 most popular games for 20+ years), HeroQuest, and many others. Plus the fact that the word hero is super commonly associated with RPGs in general. That makes that namespace cluttered and hard to craft your own thought-niche in. You'll automatically be diluting your brand by the close association with so many existing entities.<br/><br/>Nine Powers, just by itself, is a catchy name. Especially if you have a repeating theme throughout your text of using lists of 9. A couple of games have used Power in their name, but none bigger than And it passes the Google test with flying colors, actually, because as soon as you add RPG to the search (Nine Powers RPG) you get nothing of consequence - just random pages that just happen to have all 3 of those terms in them. As soon as you claim that phrase, you'll own it both in Google and in people's minds.<br/><br/>The thing about analyzing the Google-worthiness of your name is that it's about not diluting your brand. If all I remember about your original name is Narrative Adventures and I search Narrative Adventures RPG, I get a whole bunch of stuff that's not random, it's people actually talking about the concept of narrative adventures and RPGs. The words "Narrative" "Adventure" "Made" and "Easy" are used CONSTANTLY on existing blog pages of people talking about RPGs. And that's a good indication that it's a poor name.<br/><br/>And yes, people use the words "Nine" and "Powers" a little, but not very often together, because there are no hugely popular games that use those words. There's a little association with superpower games, but it's not that bad. You would not want to name a game Six Attributes because that phrase is already heavily associated with the most popular RPG ever and a thousand heartbreakers as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427324/#Comment_427324" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T10:31:04+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 10:31AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nine Powers is still a bit on the generic side, in my opinion.

What the PCs do</b><br/><b>2. What makes the game mechanics special?</b><br/><b>3. What exemplifies the setting?</b><br/><b>4. Which type of people would enjoy the game?</b></blockquote>\n<b>1. The PCs solve quests by cleverly overcoming obstacles to gain success.</b><br/><br/>The obstacles are often defined by being slightly tougher than what is easy for the PC.  A monster might have equal Melee skill.  A door might be passable if the PC had two greater Machinery skill to pick its lock, or two greater Wrestle skill to knock it down.  The PC needs to explore to find a situational advantage, find a better tool, use a skill with better leverage, or discover a way to go around the obstacle.  This is not only a fun challenge, but is a real lesson about problem solving.<br/><br/>The PC also has some limited/expensive consumable items that grant temporary skill boosts.  These allow the Player to say either "I am not interested in certain kinds of obstacles and want a cheat for them" or "I feel rewarded by advanced planning and predict the quest will have this kind of obstacle."<br/><br/><b>2. The Player need not know any game mechanics.</b><br/><br/>The GM can do all the comparing of skill ratings with opposing skills or required "target numbers".  The Player might enjoy being  part of that.  Or the Player might simply think, "My heroine is like Wendy from <i>Peter Pan</i>.  She needs some way to get past the pirate besides fighting it with her knife.  Maybe she could sweet talk him, but I do not want to try that yet.  She is not strong enough to push open the door.  Maybe she can find a crowbar, or get in through a window?"<br/><br/>The latter is obviously very trusting of the GM's fairness and clear communication, but is what makes the game mechanics stand apart.  The quests have all the creative problem-solving and careful resource use of "traditional" fantasy RPGs but without dice slowing down the story telling.<br/><br/>(Dice are optional.  My five-year-old son prefers them.  He is developmentally at an age when comparing numbers is in itself suspenseful and exciting.  Even with dice, the story moves really quickly.)<br/><br/><b>3. The nine Powers have made the setting ripe for adventure</b><br/><br/>Each Power has a different idea of what "success" looks like.  Each oversees a specific kind of dungeon, contest, champion, gift, and monster.<br/><br/>This allows a setting that (at least for biased 'ol me) "makes sense" while still being fantastic.  There are reasons why dragons hoard wealth, villages have haunted houses, wuxia-style heroes wander from town to town righting wrongs, and great archers never run out of arrows.<br/><br/>In other words, I have tried to carefully hang just the right <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" rel="nofollow">lampshades</a>.<br/><br/><b>4. People would enjoy the game if they want a RPG that feels like a traditional fantasy RPG without the story telling slowed by game mechanics, especially if they are looking for a two-player game.</b><br/><br/>It is not a "rules light" game.  It is a "rules unobtrusive" game that works with only one PC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427496/#Comment_427496" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T05:14:10+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  5:14AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2014 6:12AM by catty_big.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">@DavidVS</a> That's very interesting, thanks.

Anything else?<br/><br/><i>Nine Powers: Tales of Heroism and Loss<br/>Nine Powers: Tales of Wonder and Terror</i><br/><br/>Maybe I'm parsing the game incorrectly and those are wrong, but they at least stand out from the field a little more.<br/><br/>I like "Flow" and "Mettle", but the mix of game and character terms comes out incoherent for me.

Sets up the conflict and might draw people to think - who/what are the Nine Powers? Of course, I'm not sure if the Nine Powers are really the source of the conflict after all. You could definitely add a fat subtitle "Against the Nine Powers: an adventure game of heroism, cunning, and wonder for all ages". Actually, that would hook me in right there. (<i>Had solo in there, but I realize this isn't a solo game!</i>)<br/><br/>Something like Quest of the Nine Powers could also work in that regard, but it sounds like a Choose Your Own Adventure (which isn't necessarily bad) or a teenage fantasy novel (which could be).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427614/#Comment_427614" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T19:14:31+00:00" title="January 23, 2014  7:14PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2014 7:18PM by DavidVS.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking more on the word mettle led me to the word resolve, which fits both determination and problem solving.  <i>Clever Resolutions</i> or <i>Deft Resolve</i> are yet other ideas.<br/><br/>David_Berg, the short answer to "Anything else?" is unfortunately "not yet".  Eventually I hope to compose an abundance of short adventures as I create them for my wife and sons.  (I have three online that need updating with the new races/monsters, and a half-dozen worthy of archiving that are only written on papers in a folder downstairs.)  In my head are two overall plots that start out well-hidden.  The first is to stop the evil Power named Gnash from bringing its even more appalling sibiling into the PC's world.  The second is to rescue Old Man River, who has been imprisoned by another Power.  So some day I hope the answer to "Anything else?" will be "layers of mystery, intrigue, and problem-solving to maintain the balance as the Powers strive for dominance."  But I should not advertise what is off in the future.  Otherwise <i>The Tenth Power</i> seems a likable choice.<br/><br/>Thank for the humor and encouragment, Eero_Tuovinen.  Unfortunately, looking calmly inward led me to the current name, which my wife dislikes and which appears bad for eventual publicity.<br/><br/>NathanHill, I have been thinking about (but searching this topic shows I had not mentioned yet) using the word "contesting" similar to your "against".  The game mechanics use "contested skill comparisons", and as I wrote above the adventures will eventually center around the Powers striving against each other in tremendous but subtle schemes.  So I was considering <i>Contesting Powers</i> but it never clicked for me.  Perhaps because most of the <a href="http://davidvs.net/name/champions.shtml" rel="nofollow">Champions</a> are appropriate options for a PC, so a PC might be directly serving one or more Powers, either as a permanent identity or in a sequence of appointments.  Same with <i>Against the Nine  Powers</i>.  It seems to discourage one likely PC role.  The byline you provided, "a solo adventure game of heroism, cunning, and wonder for all age", is a truly great summary.<br/><br/>And I do like <i>Nine Powers</i> a lot.  Just not quite enough to settle with it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427616/#Comment_427616" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T21:26:46+00:00" title="January 23, 2014  9:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I like "Flow" and "Mettle", but the mix of game and character terms comes out incoherent for me.

The title also has a subtle anti-authoritarian bent, which might be appropriate for a youth facing a world of adult perils.<br/><br/>The only downside is the "Trust No One" connotations of conspiracy, spies and intrigue, which are wholly inappropriate.  Hopefully a good subtitle and illustration would clear that up.<br/><br/>Here's a thought: tacking an exclamation point onto the end, while perhaps a bit cheesy, might convey that this is more of a fun, empowered, and kid-friendly game, and not a grim conspiracy.<br/><i>Trust No Powers!</i><br/><br/>(As before, all this is subject to whether I really understand the game or not, so please judge accordingly.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427761/#Comment_427761" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T10:11:16+00:00" title="January 29, 2014 10:11AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2014 10:17AM by catty_big.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Part of me likes <i>Nine Powers: Tales of Adventure and Daring</i>, but mostly that name makes me want to sing "Woo hoo" [snip]. ).</blockquote>Well, <a href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">@w00hoo</a> would welcome that I\u2019m sure.\n<blockquote>Something like Quest of the Nine Powers could also work in that regard, but it sounds like a Choose Your Own Adventure (which isn't necessarily bad) or a teenage fantasy novel (which could be).</blockquote>Works for me, and I don\u2019t think it sounds too much like a teen fantasy novel. I mean, it hasn\u2019t got vampires or werewolves in it. Anne Rice? Nah, chips for me please.\n<blockquote>Thinking more on the word mettle led me to the word resolve, which fits both determination and problem solving.  <i>Clever Resolutions</i> or <i>Deft Resolve</i> are yet other ideas.</blockquote>Can\u2019t say I find these appealing. And, while <i>mettle</i>, <i>flow</i> and <i>resolve</i> are ok words in themselves, I don\u2019t think they really work as elements of a game name. \n<blockquote>I feel like in RPG land "Adventure and Daring" is a bit generic</blockquote>That's not necessarily a bad thing. And to the general point that the name should describe what the game does, again, not necessarily. What the name does is makes someone pick up the book in a shop or trade stand, click on the link on your website or forum, or sign up for a game, and in many ways the less specific the better: you want as many people as possible to pick up it, and ultimately buy it, and remember, these people aren\u2019t always RPers necessarily. In marketing terms, the name sells a dream, rather than explains exactly how to get there and what to do when you arrive. It also has separate resonances from the explanatory material. Think of Scrabble: does that describe putting little plastic tiles next to each other to make words? No, it refers to the sound made as you rummage around in the pouch for your next bunch of letters.  \n<blockquote><i>Nine Powers: Tales of Heroism and Loss<br/>Nine Powers: Tales of Wonder and Terror</i></blockquote>More like it; of the two, I\u2019d prefer the latter, as <i>loss</i> is a negative- marketing again. But\u2026\n<blockquote><i>Nine Powers: Tales of Adventure and Daring</i>This is by far the best suggestion I've seen here. </blockquote>Agreed!!<br/><br/>Seriously, don\u2019t sweat it too much dude, but obviously naming is an important part of the design process, and you\u2019re right to be taking it as such. Hope this thread has helped. Oh and:\n<blockquote>May your tax return go smoothly, catty_big.</blockquote>Thanks! Finally submitted it this afternoon, hence my return to these blessed shores.

And I echo Paul in saying that folks are probably happy with the earlier names and aren't that keen on the recent ones. But sure, keep 'em coming! At the very least there's probably a psychological benefit to be had in bouncing ideas off folks here in the forum, whatever name you eventually settle on.

But that is not a priority now.<br/><br/>Huzzah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429009/#Comment_429009" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T09:56:13+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  9:56AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!
