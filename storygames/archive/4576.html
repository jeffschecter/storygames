Seriously, try to be as boring as possible.</blockquote>\nA CHALLENGE!\n<blockquote>You are a fighter in a fantasy setting. You are in a tavern, sitting alone. The tavern you are sitting in is the kind of tavern you'd get in, say, 14th-century Yorkshire, except the timber is darker in color and the fireplace is a little different. You wait around for about twenty minutes, before you decide to order a drink. You order an ale from a serving girl of 17 and a half summers or so, who looks like your cousin, but not quite, her complexion is a little more tanned. Some time later, the ale comes, and it tastes like your typical ale, except maybe a little more sour than what you are accustomed to. A while later, you feel a bit hungry, so you order sausages from another serving-girl, who looks like the first except that her hair is darker and her eyebrows arch in a slightly different way. 5 minutes later you think, hang on, I'm not that hungry, maybe I'll get her to serve me a loaf of rye bread instead. You try to get the attention of one of the serving girls, but they're busy at the back, doing god-knows-what, so you decide to wait a bit instead of making a fuss. When one of the serving girls come back, you start telling her to change your order, except that you are a bit hungry, so you say, "Never mind." She looks a bit annoyed at you, and then walks off to the kitchen. You then think, hold on, maybe rye bread would be good with sausages, and besides, you could use a bit more ale, so you try and get their attention again, but they kind of ignore you or maybe they don't hear, whatever. When they do bring you your sausages, you order the bread and more ale. You wait a bit while they bring you those things, and then you notice someone else in the room, someone you know from long ago. It's your cousin from the next county, he's come to buy some wool at the market, except he came in a bit late and the market's already closed so he's staying in the inn until the market opens the next day. So the both of you do a bit a small talk, and he asks you how it's like being a fighter. You say, oh, it's not too bad, business has been slow. He then asks you about cousin Mildred, who's given birth to her third child, a son. Oh, you didn't know that she had given birth already, she moved to Oakthorpe last winter, didn't you hear? Apparently not, according to your cousin. He then asks about your dad, and you shrug and make evasive remarks, so the conversation kind of dies there and then. The serving girl comes back with the rye bread and ale, and you say, hang on, the sausages are cold, I'd like one that isn't cold. The girl grumbles a bit and takes your meal, and then comes back maybe 10 minutes later.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103583/#Comment_103583" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T05:38:52+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  5:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ask the GM for a list of beers and elven wines I can choose from, with prices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103585/#Comment_103585" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T05:40:29+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  5:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2007 5:47AM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I'll explain later, if that's OK.

However you choose to sacrifice the the possibility of future in farmhouse and raising cattle in favor of... ADVENTURE. There's probably a rationale for this and the fact that your recently-found-long-lost-love joins you (but she's a ninja and a hot one). As you step out from the tavern, it's quite apparent that something is amiss. There's a steady swarm of MECHANICAL INDIANS (no tribe specified, we call them El Pulpo Indiands, with apologies to real indians) advancing towards the city formerly know as yel olde fantasy city, but now more like A Steampunkville. Oh noes! A fight that could turn the tide in this county (not the whole land or, god forbid, world - that's the next level) ensues! You and the ninja fight like madmen. The mechanical indian chief thinks you're a worthy opponent and offers you a change to join into his evergrowing army, a prosthetic limb and a change to meet the spirit wolf.

That thing is filled with TURMOIL!  <b><i>Why</i></b> do you evade talking about your father?  How does it feel to be in a fighter-economic-downturn?  So many unanswered questions!<br/><br/>Sheesh ... even I can be more boring than that:<blockquote>You are a fighter in a fantasy setting. You are in a tavern, sitting alone. Sitting alone is an acceptable cultural practice in this area, and not stigmatized. While the majority of people don't travel alone (though neither is there either any strict injunction against it, nor are the roads so dangerous that practical concerns would require travelling in pairs, or even in larger numbers, as some more imperilled regions, but not this one, occasionally require) it is not uncommon for one member of a pair to decide that they are more interested in getting some sleep than in immediately eating, or for two people to choose to both eat, but to eat at different times in the evening.  This, together with the people who do travel alone (in the absence of practical bars, as I cited above) creates a reasonable proportion of people who choose to sit alone.  Absent any correlation between that subsection of people and any traits viewed as undesirable (either for legitimate reasons, such as lone brigands travelling the roadways and entering respectable establishments incognito to secure food and supplies (a common tactic, as reports of the social separation between criminal elements and the common, lawful man in medieval society have been greatly exaggerated) or for religious or cultural stigma) this population has created an understandable perception in the local society of sitting alone as a normative, and therefore unthreatening, activity.  In short, no judgment accrues, save the obvious ... a judgment that you are, at least for the moment, without companionship (as such alternate possibilities as miniscule companions (pixies, etc.) or invisible ones occur in such a vanishingly small percentage of cases (well outside of four standard deviations, and therefore beyond the likely expectations of any observer) as to make it unlikely that local observers would even entertain the notions, much less give them credence, unless they are particularly superstitious and paranoid individuals, and I wouldn't list the perceptions of such people as part of the overall judgment of a society (unless such traits were wide-spread) but rather would describe them as individual judgments, along with a description of the person involved, but no such individuals are present, or at least if they are they aren't making their judgments visible in such a way as to merit description, though you can roll a spot check if you'd like).<br/><br/>The tavern is a large building, as befits its purpose in housing large numbers of people.  The room you are in is particularly large, in the context of the building itself, though not unreasonably or unexpectedly large given its purpose, which is to serve as a common area for serving food and for other general purposes.  In keeping with that function, it is, as I've mentioned, fairly large.  Most of the room's construction is of wood, that being a local building material due to the presence nearby of significant stands of timber in the form of forests.  In some areas, even near forests, other building materials such as brick or stone are used more heavily, either due to their greater availability (particularly in the case of fieldstone construction, where stones must be de-facto "quarried" from fields as part of plowing the fields (as, naturally, the plow catches on the stones and agricultural progress cannot proceed (at least with the typical furrow-based practices of the time) without the removal of the stone to another place)) or due to taboos against the cutting of wood, either non-rational (or, as is often the case in religion, of no IMMEDIATE rational backing, though indirect reasons and patterns may prove to be very compelling when analyzed fully) or rational (such as the presence of treants or dryads in nearby woods, which would make the indirect cost of logging much higher than the opportunity cost involved in dedicating labor (usually not a scarce resource in medieval societies) to the more time-intensive processes of extracting other building materials).  However, in this case, those factors must not apply (at least to their fullest extent, unless they do apply but have not yet been fully understood, or perhaps the use of wood in this building is a deliberate social signal playing off of opposition to those known restrictions, either to increase the status of the owner or that of the community) because the construction does appear to be of wood.  However, the hearth area, where a fire provides both warmth and light for the room (though that light is supplemented by tapers, typical for this region and purpose, as candles (though providing a clearer and more consistent light) are sufficiently resource intensive to recommend the lowly taper (of cloth treated or impregnated with parrafin or other combustible material, appropriately doped so as neither to burn too quickly nor too hotly for the receptacles into which it will be placed) as a reasonable economic substitute, one which the tavern owners (necessarily rational actors, as both the technologies involved and the trade routes that control supply and cost have been largely static for long enough that economic darwinism would have gradually weeded out those who apply irrational value judgments to these questions) would obviously embrace) as well as heat for cooking is made of stone.  This is in keeping both with local manufacture and resources, and with its purpose in the room.</blockquote>... to be continued ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103603/#Comment_103603" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T06:40:16+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  6:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2007 6:41AM by TonyLB.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Your sword leans against your chair.  Carrying a sword in public is NOT normative cultural practice, though it is within the standard set of social archetypes to which a typical member of the local populace would have been exposed.  The fact that it elicits no explicit comment at this time and place (which is not to say that there are not implicit comments inherent in people's placement and body language, only that such comments are not sufficiently out of the ordinary to warrant comment at this time) is due to the social context of the tavern itself, as a place for wayfarers.  The same sword, naturally, would be a different social artifact in, e.g., a farmer's living room (though, truth be told, economics in this area as well as demographics would indicate that most farmers would not have a living room worthy of the name, since giving a specific role-title to the room indicates that it would be distinct to that role, whereas for many (though not all, but certainly sufficient to be considered the plurality, and therefore sufficient to use as a short-hand "typical" case, lest our discussion become unwieldy) farmers the "living room" would in fact be nothing more than "the room", in which all functions of the household (except for those which, due to their very nature, are unsuitable for mixing with the living area of the house) are conducted).  However, in the social context of the tavern, the sword is an expected feature, being correlated both with wealthy outsiders and with travellers concerned for their own safety.  Since both of those populations are disproportionately represented in the context of the tavern (due to the self-selection of people who choose to frequent the tavern (which is not to say that locals AVOID the tavern, indeed they flock to it, but nonetheless the tendency of outsiders to visit ONLY the tavern creates a substantial self-selection bias despite the local population's tendencies)) the presence of the sword is a not-atypical feature of the modified social population that could be expected in this context.  As such, it is unlikely to draw comment unless someone were specifically seeking out your services in the role which that sword typically represents, e.g. a merchant who might wish to hire you to guard (for example) a caravan (as, though brigandage and other threats to travellers are not sufficient to merit extreme measures in the case of most (whose resources to effect those measures are limited in any event) they are a sufficient concern that those specifically setting out to transport valuables a long distance would be rationally motivated to invest somewhat in the protection of those resources.  Such brigandage and threat, by the way, is not unusual for this period of history, and indeed their absence (a complete safety upon the roads) would be more of a powerful indicator of information about the local area, as it would (in the hypothetical) indicate either strongly organized criminal elements (perhaps in league with local political figures) or a strong effort in the past to purge crime and to secure the roadways (often a prelude to imperialist expansion).  However, the threat on the roadways appears (at least from the perception and patterns of behavior of local people) to be normal, such that it would not indicate any such situation.)  And, though it would be hypothetically possible (and not abnormal at all) for a merchant to approach you in order to guard a caravan, that is not such a common occurrence that its absence should be noted.  Indeed, there is no merchant, and so your sword goes without comment.<br/><br/>Roll a Knowledge: Local Custom check to discern the nature of the home-spuns and other fabrics being worn by the other people in the tavern.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103608/#Comment_103608" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T06:59:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  6:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, Tony, you win.

You are in a tavern, sitting alone. You think about the evil dictator of the land over the Black Seas, and how you have sworn vengeance upon him. You get your friends together and then go unseat him. Then you decide to help liberate the people who had to live under him. You take over the reins of government until they can elect a new leader, but you don't like the leader they elect, so you hang around some more. People start to resent you, so you kill a few to teach them a lesson about gratitude. Then they get really mad, and try to kill you every day. It's too much to handle, and you pay some guys you met at the tavern to come in and help. They kill a lot of people and don't seem too upset about it, and you know, it's ok with you. But then your magic-user cousin sends you a letter and he's really upset about all this. You tell him to shut it, and that you'll be home in a year, but a year later, you still have to take care of these people, because they've obviously never seen a real fighter before. Your wife sends you a letter and she's upset too. You tell her to hold her horses, and she sleeps with your goddamn magic-user cousin while you're over here defending her way of life, but that's what a fighter does, right?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103689/#Comment_103689" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:04:58+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are a fighter in a tavern. It is late afternoon as you sit down on the rough grained wooden bar stool. You can see the sun beginning to set through the window behind the bar. After weeks of walking long hours each day only to set up camp to sleep on hard and rocky pavement you could almost be excited to be among people again where you can sleep in a real bed and converse with actual people. You stool creaks slightly as you shift your weight for a more comfortable seat. A glance at the other stools to your left and right shows them to be extremely dry and well worn, suggesting the tavern has been here for a good number of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is typical of your way and your profession, you take time to note everything around you to the smallest detail. Observing the bar you see it is made of a rich cherry wood of high quality and are quite sure when it had been new it had cost the bar keep a pretty penny. Though these days the bar itself is as well worn as the bar stools sitting in front of it, smooth and worn by years of use every night by patrons. You mentally note that the bar, despite its age, remains very sturdy and in the event of a hostile crowd in the bar you know you could hop over the bar and hold off a dozen men fighting from behind it. Though an initial glance at the few patrons actually in the tavern at this hour tells you you have no need to worry about a bat fight breaking out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour attention shifts to the short plump blond bair maid walking your way. Your best estimate places the girl around age fifteen or sixteen. She smiles shyly at you. If it weren't for the unwashed state of her hair, old and worn state of her light brown woll dress and stocky, heavy set posture, you think her smile could almost make her seem pretty. Then on second thought, in fact, you simply realize that you have been travelling among the barren wastes too long and probably consider any women not utterly smeared with dirst and grim to be attractive. "Would you like something to drink good Sir?" she asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the passive nature of the patrons you consider her question a moment and decide to splurge a bit and order a nice bottle of red wine. Under more usual circumstances you would normally just ask for a watered down ale, showing a good sensible degree of caution against having too much drink in the presence of strangers. A second glance around the room assures you that tonight caution is not so necessary. There are only three other patrons in the tavern at present. Two middle aged men in their late twenties sitting together having simple bowls of stew and drinking ale and one elderly lady sitting on the other side of the room knitting a sweater. The two men, based on their dingy old clothing and dirty bare feet are obviously farmers and have come in for a simple dinner after working the fields all day. Most likely single men with no families of their own yet and here to hopefully socialize with some single ladies as, presumably, a few more patrons come in. Quite possibly one of the men might even fancy the young bar maid here, which would explain their willingness to splurge on a tavern bought meal. On another day you might watch them a bit more to verify that assumption, but you are tired tonight and could really care less.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou opt to study the old lady in the corner a bit more, just to be safe. You just never know what an old sorceress or witch might look like and its always good to identify those types up front. The old women seems to be wearing a shoddy old dress that might have been somewhat nice ten or twenty years ago. These days it is little more than rags. However it is the absense of any pouches that put you at ease. Lacking those it seems highly unlikely the old lady could be carrying any magical dusts or powders or any of the spell components for making magic. After delivering your drink the bar made walks over to the table where the old lady continues to knit her sweater and sits down. The old lady takes no notice nor do the two begin talking. You decide the old lady and the bar made are probably both belong to the family that runs the tavern. Possibly grandmother and grand daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Continued--                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103692/#Comment_103692" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:19:21+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:19AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan... please... no...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103698/#Comment_103698" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:30:43+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After having a bit of wine you wave the bar made over. The wine has helped to relace you and your growling stomach had reminded you that you haven't eaten anything all day excepting that hard baked biscut you had for breakfast. You ask what the tavern has for food. She says the house specialty is stew, of course. The house specialty at most every peasant tavern you have ever been too was stew. You decide stew is perfectly fine for tonight and order a large bowl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter eating dinner you look out the window once more and see that it is nearly dark now. Not having seen the tavern owner yet, you ask the bar maid when she expects him. She smiles that pudgy little smile of hers and says that he should be in shortly. After working their own crops that they keep out behind the tavern some days he has to take their wagon down to the general store to buy supplies for the tavern. You thank the bar girl and return to enjoying your wine. Not wanting to think to much about your recent travels you content yourself with a further study of the tavern. Behind the bar you see two barrels of ale, you presume to include one lighter ale and one darker ale. There are a hand full of liquor bottles, mostly near full still, and a few ceramic mugs and small selection of spices. Not surprised to see the spices out here instead of in the kitchen considering how bland the stew had been. That means the community here must truly be a poor one and given the expense of buying spices at the trade markets, none gets used on food unless specially ordered. Further review of the bar shows no place a sword, axe or other meaningful weapon could be hidden, though that does not preclude a small dagger or knife being stashed away back there. The apparant lack of a need of weapons for protection tells you this little village likely has no real need for protection against outsiders and that the tavern owner is reasonably well respected among the community. You consider both to be a good indicator that you'll be able to get a safe and peaceful rest this evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a half hour later the tavern owner returns and you strike up a short conversation and arrive at the price of five copper to rent one of the upstairs rooms for the evening. With that you grab you bag and sword and shuffle off upstairs to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Most importantly, if the "scenario" is that "I" am a fighter, I assume you mean that I'm a player, with a fighter character, and am narrating what I do as a fighter? Or is the exercise assumed to be that the "scenario" is what I as GM have read to the player to start, and I am the GM narrating what happens next? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr is the intent to get the interplay between both parties narrating the outcome of the bar scenario? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe've seen examples of all of these above. And I'm wondering if all are salient to your experiment. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr is the intent not to make a description of a RPG narration, but just of any narration (and, if that's so, I'll have to hold my question about why we're discussing it here)? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I think it's clear, but to be sure, we're supposed to try to figure out what bores you, Graham? Apparently some people here are simply putting down statements about their agenda and what would bore them, personally. Is that Kosher? I'm worried that it might taint the experiment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try to bore your socks off, once I understand the manner in which I'm supposed to be doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that wasn't too boring...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103746/#Comment_103746" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T15:26:41+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  3:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2007 3:28PM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, yes, the idea is that your character is a fighter in a tavern, and I'd like you, the player, to narrate what happens next.

I am in a tavern, sitting alone. It is quite nice. I am happy. Everything is fine. Things are quite pleasant here. Nothing bad is happening. Everything seems OK. I am happy that I am alone being a fighter. It's fine that I am in a fantasy setting. That's my kind of setting. I like it here. I look around and see that everything is OK. The chair is fine. The tavern is quite nice. I like being in taverns. It's my kind of place. Especially a fantasy tavern. They are particularly agreeable, I find. There's nothing quite like a fantasy tavern for being agreeable. Especially when you are a fighter in a fantasy setting. Which is what I am. And if you are a fighter in a fantasy setting who finds himself alone in a fantasy tavern, sitting is a very good thing to do. Which why I am doing exactly and precisely that. Without any help from anyone else. Because I am alone, which makes the possibility of assistance from others by definition impossible. Looking around, I remind myself that I appear to be located presently in a fantasy tavern that is in turn located within the confines of a fantasy setting, a observation which gives me no small degree of satisfaction. It is, in short, good. The tavern is a convivial environment for sedentary solitude, well adapted to slothful inactivity in a sword-and-sorcery milieu. The sword-and-sorcery milieu is also very nice, a narrative setting in which as a fantasy fighter I feel entirely comfortable and well-placed. It is my milieu of choice, my chosen fictional repository, my literary home, my narrative abode. I am very relaxed about this overall situation, which seems relatively devoid of unpleasant or threatening elements. It is indeed a congenial confluence of circumstances about which I can find very little to criticize. Even the chair is nice and really rather pleasant to sit upon. Especially if you are a fantasy fighter in a fantasy setting, which veritably is my said situation at this juncture in time. This really is a remarkably welcoming establishment, I must say. Should I ever leave, I shall certainly be sure to come back here in short order. Seldom in all my fantasy fighting experience have I happened upon a more pleasant place in which to while away the time. I really doubt very much whether it could be noticeably bettered, in fact. I would go so far as to describe it as quite optimal. Not only is it unsurpassed in its singular agreeableness, but its domestic harmony and bibatory suitability also deserve to be the stuff of fame and acclamation over a not inconsiderable area. Not to mention its ample provisions for the fictional combatant desirous of well-constructed instruments of recumbency. I think I shall sit here for a while and enjoy the ambience. It is after all an opportunity too good to pass up.</blockquote>\nIf you're not bored yet, you are a man of some patience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103759/#Comment_103759" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T16:52:29+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  4:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, at a certain point the boredom become silly and then funny and suddenly isn't boring anymore.

So when I read some of it I start analyzing it differently since I know there is a point to it all.  My mind's engaged wondering how the author is going to maintain a narrative where the main actor does nothing interesting.  I'm also analyzing whether what's being written is actually interesting, which makes me find things I wouldn't otherwise.

So there wouldn't be any "Wenches" in this tavern, if they were in my world. They'd be called "Aleboys" or something. Interestingly, my character would also likely be female. Not the usual female type of fighter character, you know with the chainmail bikini and giant sword and tiny waist and huge breasts, no she'd be built like a tank, all muscles. It's the boys that wear all the tight skimpy clothes, and not being allowed to do the "womanly" work, they would be traditionally slight of build. Oh, I need to roll Charisma? Well it's like at 16 or something, let me check the sheet. Um... I can't find it, the layout of the stats for this game is stupid. No! Wait I see it, it's not called Charisma! Oh, I have to choose between Appearance or Mental Affinity. That seems pretty redundant, I mean there's only one strength stat, so why complicate things so much for something as unimportant as Charisma. Well I'll go with Appearance, I've got "6 Staves" in that. Is that a lot? My Mental Affinity is "3 Coins". I brought all my dice, I have a bunch of D10s. I used to play Exhalted a lot, but got bored because the GM was useless, and I kept winning too easily. What dice do I roll? I want to get the wench to want me, you know. That's why I'll use appearance, can I use another stat to help me? My dexterity is really high, maybe I could show how supple I am? Oh, wow! We're using Tarot cards, that's so cool. I used to have a set of Tarot cards, they were really freaky. I used to do readings for my friends, and I was always right. I managed to predict that my friend, Lance, would fail his exams. I didn't tell him that, of course. I did the same reading on a bunch of people at school, to see who would pass and who wouldn't. I predicted that I would get the highest out of all my friends, which came true of course, but I didn't need to check the cards for that! Hahaha!. So what do I do, do I just draw one, or are we using one of the standard spreads? I think the Celtic Cross is the best. Would it be possible to change the sytem to use it? Oh, look. I pulled the Ace of Staves, that's good right? So I get chatting to this girl at the bar. Is she hot? I mean I wouldn't really be talking to her if she wasn't hot, and I mean hot by our standards, not medieval England standards. I'm doing a history course at the moment, and I rekon that all the woman back then would have been really ugly. I mean they don't really have any understanding of hygene, so of course they'll be all manky and gross. I ain't touching a woman like that. In my game, the one I was talking about before. The civilisation has discovered baths and stuff, I made sure to make that explicit..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103994/#Comment_103994" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T23:31:15+00:00" title="October 20, 2007 11:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I yawn, and I look outside and see that it's still dark outside.  There's not much to see, but I gaze casually at the ground that fully surrounds the tavern.  I count to a thousand, and it is still dark.  Sooner or later, maybe hours from now, the sun will rise and that will mean I will have only wait here for six more days before the soup of the day  is mutton stew.  Yesterday was chicken broth, which is alright.  Oh, but that means it will be five days till mutton stew.  I try counting to two thousand this time, and roll several dice to see how far I get.  Thirty-seven.  So I start counting from there and get to five hundred seventy-three before giving up and checking outside again.  Still dark.  I look back inside.  There's a couple whores dozing at a corner table.  I don't care to spend my money.  Instead, I climb up the stairs and look at my room.  It is empty, except for a bed.  The window makes it obvious that it's still dark outside.  I try to determine the shade of darkness, but it looks pretty normal.  Slightly more dark than my room.  I don't step inside; no reason to.  I linger within the doorway and consider the difference between a hallway and a room.  One is more squarish.  It is a short hallway (I roll to determine how short: 8.6 feet), but the room is more squarish all told.  I don't feel like sleeping, so it's a waste of a silver, really; but it is no matter.  If the night were halfway through, then maybe mutton stew is only four days away.  Except it isn't served till midday.  Do church bells sound at midnight?  I can't recall ever hearing them at midday, but it's easy to get used to such noises.  There is no church.  I was thinking of the tavern at Braxely.  It also had squarish rooms.  I wonder if it is light yet at Braxely.  They never served mutton stew.  I could travel there if I ever got bored here.  The door frame offers no opinion.  I walk back down to the bar.  One of the regular customers has gone home, but I can't remember who all was here before.  I roll to remember and get a 6.  I remember, but it was actually the entertainment who left.  There was entertainment?  Too bad I hadn't noticed them.  They may have passed the time.  At least until leaving.  What time do they normally leave?  I ask the bartender what time it is.  He looks outside and tells me it's still dark.  I tip him a copper and sigh and sit back down at the bar.  I look over the selection of water-beers.  I don't like to get drunk when I'm waiting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Bore me - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4576/bore-me/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Bore me - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4576/bore-me/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Tony is right - Mike wins the thread for his meta-boring post.

So, I recite some verse to bide the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Elven-maid there was of old,<br/>\nA shining star by day:<br/>\nHer mantle white was hemmed with gold,<br/>\nHer shoes of silver-grey.<br/>\n<br/>\nA star was bound upon her brows,<br/>\nA light was on her hair<br/>\nAs sun upon the golden boughs<br/>\nIn L\xc3\xb3rien the fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white,<br/>\nAnd fair she was and free;<br/>\nAnd in the wind she went as light<br/>\nAs leaf of linden-tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel,<br/>\nBy water clear and cool,<br/>\nHer voice as falling silver fell<br/>\nInto the shining pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere now she wanders none can tell,<br/>\nIn sunlight or in shade;<br/>\nFor lost of yore was Nimrodel<br/>\nAnd in the mountains strayed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elven-ship in haven grey<br/>\nBeneath the mountain-lee<br/>\nAwaited her for many a day<br/>\nBeside the roaring sea.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wind by night in Northern lands<br/>\nArose, and loud it cried,<br/>\nAnd drove the ship from elven-strands<br/>\nAcross the streaming tide.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost,<br/>\nThe mountains sinking grey<br/>\nBeyond the heaving waves that tossed<br/>\nTheir plumes of blinding spray.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmroth beheld the fading shore<br/>\nNow low beyond the swell,<br/>\nAnd cursed the faithless ship that bore<br/>\nHim far from Nimrodel.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf old he was an Elven-king,<br/>\nA lord of tree and glen,<br/>\nWhen golden were the boughs in spring<br/>\nIn fair Lothl\xc3\xb3rien.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap,<br/>\nAs arrow from the string,<br/>\nAnd dive into water deep,<br/>\nAs mew upon the wing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wind was in his flowing hair,<br/>\nThe foam about him shone;<br/>\nAfar they saw him strong and fair<br/>\nGo riding like a swan.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from the West has come no word,<br/>\nAnd on the Hither Shore<br/>\nNo tidings Elven-folk have heard<br/>\nOf Amroth evermore. <br/>\n<br/>\nVery nice, I think to myself. There's more though. <br/>\n<br/>\nSnow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!<br/>\nO Queen beyond the Western Seas!<br/>\nO light to us that wander here<br/>\nAmid the world of woven trees!<br/>\n<br/>\nGilthoniel! O Elbereth!<br/>\nClear are thy eyes and bright thy breath,<br/>\nSnow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee<br/>\nIn a far land beyond the Sea. <br/>\n<br/>\n...wait...enough...there's some confusion over by the bar but I ignore it. I leave the tavern and walk up to the fellow in black. "Do it" I say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure, if Tolkien's verse doesn't make to want to kill yourself, you have a real cheerful problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104039/#Comment_104039" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T12:31:34+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 12:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who actually read any of the Tolkien poems?

If you try to be interesting, you're often boring. Like all these things, it's not a hard and fast rule, but there's some sense in it.<br/><br/>Burr's post, above, is perfect. In an effort to be boring, he's describing lots of mundane details and they're actually rather interesting. Lots of others are also fascinating, at least in parts.<br/><br/>You can actually <i>be</i> boring, of course, by repeating yourself, using a convoluted style of writing, describing things that aren't relevant, stuff like that.<br/><br/>Thank you.

Particularly, it is possible (indeed, easy, once you get the knack) to describe stuff <b>as part of</b> your explanation of why it would never be relevant.  "These are five interesting things that could be happening, which I'm going to describe in excruciating detail in order to explain to you why they <i>aren't</i> happening."<br/><br/>This little exercise has pushed me a little further away from using hypotheticals in my world-conveying.
