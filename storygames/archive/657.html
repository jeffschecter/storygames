Actual Play examples only, please.  No metaphors about food or books or whatever.<br/>

Examples from the table that clearly define it.<br/>

                            In our recent Primetime Adventures game, we often scene-framed for other peoples' characters by saying what that character was feeling or did. Later in the game we scaled back to simply saying who was present &amp; whether it was plot or character oriented.  <br/>
<br/>
I see the earlier way we were doing it as "push". We made statements about what other people's characters did or felt, directing how the other player would then play.  <br/>
<br/>
The second way I see as "pull".  We suggested the characters present and left it open what their activities were and what their actions &amp; reactions might be.  We created an opening for the other players to step in and bring their own ideas.                        </div>

                            I'm still not ten thousand percent sure I really understand push/pull, but let me see if I can provide something concrete from <i>Gloria Mundi</i> last week.<br/><br/>The context: Marcus Antius Idir had gotten himself into a fight with a relative stranger, Titus Marcellinus Honorus, the adopted son of a woman he was trying to murder.<br/><br/>It started out as a Push conflict.  Idir sets up traps in the hallways leading to the room he's trying to defend.  Honorus pulls out the magic and starts to come in through the ceiling, dripping stone everywhere as it melts around his pet witch.  Idir goes invisible and heads upstairs to sow chaos among Honorus's people, taking out the witch in the process.  Honorus pulls out the pickaxe and starts going through the floor by hand.  As Idir's player and I went back and forth, we were trying to top each other, come up with a situation that the other couldn't respond to.<br/><br/>Then we realized that we could go back and forth with this all night.  Richard and I looked at each other, and Richard said, "Maybe Idir could challenge Honorus to a duel."  Hmm, I thought, this is interesting.  "Sure," I said, "That would be cool.  But you should be playing for time and he's playing to win, since you've got reinforcements coming."  "Ooh," said Richard, "I love it.  Let's play that out.  Can I make a fool of Honorus?"  "Why don't you start by cutting the straps on his sandals?  But he's going to be able to hurt you pretty badly if you're just trying to be flashy."  "That's no problem," said Richard.  "I want to end this fight just barely on my feet, if I win it."  And things went on from there.<br/><br/>Both kinds of play were really fun, but they were quite clearly different to me.  Is that push/pull?                        </div>

                            I'm in between exams at the moment, and figured I'd chime in with something that might be helpful.  Note that this is based on the thinking I'm doing for my blog article for next week, so I happen to think I've been somewhat thorough about it.<br/><br/>Pushing is trying to get someone to do something by threatening something they want to keep safe.  Pulling is about trying to get someone to do something by offering them something they desire to have.<br/><br/>A couple of hypotheticals, and then some actual play (as requested).<br/><br/>"You open the door, you can tell me what you see, but if you don't I'll make up something really bad for you."  (Without surrounding context, I'm going to pretend this is a push.  I'm threatening you with Dire Consequences if you do not provide a description).<br/>"You open the door, what do you see?" (Pull.  I am offering something I think you want: input into the game's fiction).<br/>"You open the door, if you don't tell me what you see, then I will and you won't get to say next time." (Push.  I am threatening something you want to keep: input into the game's fiction).<br/><br/>Okay, on to actual play.  <i>Capes</i> is my goto game for Push and Pull.  I set a Goal on the table "Big Business shakes the Red Menace's faith in his economic philosophy".  Now, given no more context than that, it is <i>literally</i> impossible to classify this goal as a push or a pull.  So, I'll provide you with some context.<br/><br/>I'm playing Big Business, my friend is playing the Red Menace.  I happen to know that he's been <i>itching</i> for a chance to shake Red Meanace's faith in his economic philosophy.  What I am doing is <i>offering him something he wants</i>.  I am pulling him into the conflict.<br/><br/>If the context had been different.  If, for instance, he really, really wanted the Red Menace to maintain strong faith in his economic philosophy, then that would have been different.  In that case I would have been <i>threatening something he valued</i>.  Definitely a push.<br/><br/>All of this is to say, when talking about push and pull, context is king.  No statement that is purely about the game fiction can possibly be evaluated as one or the other.  Push and pull happen at a social level, and thus we must always consider the actual people playing the actual game.<br/><br/>Quick aside about <i>Capes</i>.  Note how any conflict in Capes also pulls every player <i>mechanically</i>.  The default desire is to win every conflict because doing so will gain you something of value: Inspirations.  But on the big conflicts, the ones with debt being thrown around like crazy, there's a strong desire to lose.  You are being offered delicious Story Tokens.<br/><br/>I may have stolen my own thunder there, but is that helpful to the confused?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, <br/><br/>Context is always key. This is true. (Yay! Someone heard me!) <br/><br/>For the threaten/offer issue... that is certainly one way to define it. I don't think you inherently have to threaten something to push, but it certainly is easier to see it when something is threatened. So... hey, sounds once enough like you're in handgernade range.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm not clear if that was from an actual play example, or was a hypothetical actual play example....                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Context, context, context.  I have no idea.  Why don't you tell me a bit about it?  I mean, it <i>could</i> have been a push, it <i>could</i> have been a pull.  Did your player want to describe it?  Was there a preference for your description?  I can imagine places where "threatening" my character with terrible consequences is no threat at all!  Bring on those consequences, this guy needs to suffer more!

Her father has put a bounty on PC's head because he's "interfered with her" and ruined her upcoming arranged marriage to some dude.  PC sends her a note through servants, she replies, promising an assignation at an inn.   Everyone at the table is like "Oh yeah, <em>that's</em> not a trap".  But the lover PC is a foolish guy and really wants to meet up with his lady and hit some keys hardcore, so I ask him about the ambush - who, how many, where are they.  He tells me, and we're off to the races.                        </div>

                            Is threat necessary for push? Thomas, I very much like your definition of push/pull, but they do seem to be used in a broader fashion than just what you describe.  In Jess' example, it was pull because the players were openly negotiating what happened rather than asserting it.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Doh.  That'll teach me to ask ambiguous questions.  The actual fictional context is mostly irrelevant (even if it is cool).  What matters is: did the player actually want to describe things?  If so, then you're pulling.  You're offering him something he wants (to describe the trouble he's gotten his character into).  Is there some sort of implicit agreement at the table that if you don't describe stuff when the GM asks you to then you're creatively weak?  Could this have been a threat to his social standing in the group?  Was it both working together?<br/><br/>Is that any clearer on my part?  Whether something is pushing or pulling is dependent upon social, rather than fictional, context.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Emily, I'm not sure that the open negotiation had much to do with it being pull vs. push play.  Our style of discussion didn't change much from the first half of the conflict, where Richard was saying things like, "I want to take out the witch; how long will it take me?"  I think the real difference was that instead of Richard taking Idir's part, and me taking the opposing part, we were both playing on both teams.  I wanted to make things dramatic and help Idir look cool; Richard wanted to draw out the conflict as long as possible and risk losing it.  Our mutual goal became, "Let's make this neat for both of us," not "Let's win this OUR way!"<br/><br/>I guess this is why it's good we're talking actual examples, huh?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Emily,<br/><br/>Actually I think pushes may always be threats (I'm not sure yet).  And as cool as I though Jess' example was, I really couldn't tell if it was push or pull.  At least the way I think of the two, it's about player negotiation.  I don't think that there's anything inherently pull-y in questions, or push-y in statements.  And open negotiations can definitely be push-heavy.<br/><br/>Let's go back to <i>Capes</i>, but into hypothetical land.  Let's say that my Goal in my earlier example was a push.  I'm threatening the other player with something that he would prefer (maybe it's just a mild preference, maybe it's super important, I don't know).  I up the tension by dumping debt on the conflict forcing him to reciprocate in order to have a chance of victory.  He does so, and doing so <i>might</i> be a push.  He's implicitly saying "If you'll lose this one for me, you can have all these story tokens!"<br/><br/>That's offering me something I want.  Of course he might <i>also</i> be pushing me, if I'm invested in the outcome of the conflict (rather than just using it to gain all those story tokens).<br/><br/>Oh, here's a good example of pushing in negotiation!  <i>Polaris</i>.  Sometimes you'll use a "But only if..." in order to threaten the other player with something that makes them back down.  They might in turn escalate, pushing back.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I'm tending toward Brand here.  With the caveat that I'm still short on context, it looks an awful lot like a pull to me too.  You're basically saying to the player, "Hey, I know you like being creative, and maybe you like screwing your guy and watching him squirm (I don't know about this second par), I'll let you do that if you'll do something for me..."  Of course, in this case the "something" he is doing for you is doing the description.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>Hrm. You've now made me unsure about your example. Because, among other things, "Let's make this neat for both of us," and "Let's win this OUR way!" aren't inherently opposites. It's very possible to make the whole game more fun by pushing back and forth to create and constantly heightening sense of tension. <br/><br/>To go to an actual play example: the Nine Worlds Skype game. The conflict in the first session is pretty clearly push, I'm thinking. Fred says he wants something (to escape) and Matt says he wants something opposite that (to have the character get arrested). They both then go to the mechanics in order to try to make the game go the way they most want it to. Matt wins and not only does he get what he wanted, he gets to say how it happened. <br/><br/>Now, this doesn't mean that Matt has shut down Fred's fun. Quite the opposite, really, as now Fred is in this big ball of tension and there is this story preasure of the very cool "How do I escape! What will happen next?" Fred was already invested, and so his investment keeps him in despite things not going the way he most wanted them to.                        </div>

                            So, let me see if I get this:<br/>
<br/>
Pull: The characters are entering their first fantasy city and they come to a sign laying out the city's major points of interest.  I ask each player, including myself, for a point of interest on the sign, thus creating the city.<br/>
<br/>
Push: Bret's character, Red, a 13 year old girl who, back in the real world, was physically abused by her father, is going to see who the Overlord of the Rock Knights is and *dun dun dun* it is in fact her father, who she hasn't seen in years.<br/>
<br/>
So, essentially, Pull is asking the players to directly contribute to the narration at hand.  Push is throwing something in the scene that causes the character discomfort or throws them into direct conflict.<br/>

                            I don't know.  I think part of push is giving only one out, whereas pull would be letting the player choose where out is.  By this, your second example is still pull, because you haven't told the player how to react, you've merely set up the scene.<br/>

                            What Thomas is saying is all true. <br/><br/>In a recent email conversation with Ben about this (I think Ben finally decided he didn't find the terms useful, though I'm not sure) the thing I found myself saying to him over and over and over was: <br/><br/>"I don't know. There isn't enough context there for me to say." <br/><br/>Push and Pull are about the ways you align yourself towards another player in order to bring/force something into the SIS. They aren't about the fictional content (which as we know from a million sources can end up looking like anything) nor are they about the order of things. They are about the dymanic between the players at the table in the moment when things are being decided. <br/><br/>Which is probably why they're so hard to follow, and why I've (historically) probably been less than clear about what they are. <br/><br/>Look at the Skype Nine Worlds example (God, that is such a lovely resource). Look at the way, when the cards finally come down on the table, the negotiated stance of both Matt and Fred is, "I want this, and I am going to use the system to take this using the mechanics if I can. If I cannot I will accept your thing and go with it, because you will have won the right to have it and I trust you enough to beleive it will be cool too." <br/><br/>That's push. One wanted something that threatened the other, and both dove in to try and take the thing they wanted. There was lots of negotiation leading into it, it was perfectly functional and good play. But in the end it is based on the "you want X and I want Y, they contradict each other, and now I am going to win the right to have my X." What X and Y are is settled by negotiations (which could, I think, contain both pushes and pulls of their own -- which is the other problem people run into, they want each seperate element to be a distinct thing, where they are no more so than stances are, they move into each other and out of each other constantly), and the way the conflict will be handled is "pre negotiated" by the fact they're using Nine Worlds and know how its resolution system works. <br/><br/>Now, if you just up and asked me, "Matt says to Fred: You get captured by Hercules" I couldn't tell if it was push or pull, because I can't see what Matt is doing or why, or how it effects Fred. It could well be after Fred has just pulled him into saying that, and now Matt is just stepping in. <br/><br/>So, let us now imagine an alternate Skype Nine Worlds game in which Fred tells Matt, "Hey, you know what, it'd be cool if I got captured and had to escape with a hot chick." Matt then says, "Okay, so we start with the scene of you in the house and you get arrested and Hercules is there with his golden gun, and they drag you down to the station and toss you in a cell." Fred just pulled, Matt resonded, and the push will probably come when Matt and Fred disagree about how is going to escape, or at what cost he is going to escape. <br/><br/>You could, in a write up of either of those games say, "And then Matt tells Fred he gets tossed in jail" and ask me which is push and which is pull, and I wouldn't be able to tell you without all the information behind it. Unless you have a picture of the larger way that people are interacting with each other you can't tell which is which in most simple cases. But in a voice recording of the whole conflict, it becomes possible to tell which is which. <br/><br/>This, BTW, is why I so rarely post AP reports these days -- because writing down enough material to get at the power dynamics behind what is happening at the table is a bloody draining long process. I also find that when I look at most people's AP reports I don't have any idea of who is pushing and who is pulling (except in unusual circumstances in which someone has crossed a group line and done something to hard or to far) because mext to no one includes the kind of information needed to figure it out. <br/><br/>Judd, <br/><br/>With all that said, I feel almost (not) ready to address your points. Your first example: <code>Pull: The characters are entering their first fantasy city and they come to a sign laying out the city's major points of interest. I ask each player, including myself, for a point of interest on the sign, thus creating the city.</code>This seems to be a pull. I mean, there could be some stuff going on in the background where the GM will reject the things the players say, or where this or that -- but given a functional group that isn't playing head games, an invitation to create a part of the world that you find interesting seems pretty pull to me. <br/><br/>Also, it doesn't matter if you tell them to do it or ask them if they want to do it. That, I think is where Jess's issue starts coming in. You can force someone to do something with pull -- it isn't passive.<br/><br/>This seems like pull because, as far as I can tell, it shows you aligning youself with the players in a mode that gets them to come to you. It gets everyone to step forward and contribute to the world to form something. You have a need, and rather than filling it with an idea of your own and making them accept it (threat?), you get them to fill it for/with you. <br/><br/>Now, the second statement<code>Bret's character, Red, a 13 year old girl who, back in the real world, was physically abused by her father, is going to see who the Overlord of the Rock Knights is and *dun dun dun* it is in fact her father, who she hasn't seen in years.</code>I can't answer. This is like the "Matt says Fred is thrown in jail" above. Unless I know who started the idea, what flags the player has, and how the GM got to this point... I just can't say if this is push or pull.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I would say: <br/><br/>1. No. But flags sure fucking make it easier. <br/><br/>2. A quick example? I'm coming to think there are no quick examples. <br/><br/>Okay, a try: Mo, as a player, pulled me, as GM, when she did the whole Kika/Jerzom thing. We were playing Exalted, so didn't really have flags, and she certainly wouldn't have seen the character sheet even if they were written down. <br/><br/>So... the Jerzom/Kika thing for those that missed it before goes like this: So in the final scene, in which the character is going to face her rapist, murderer, and the would be soul-destroyer of the universe, Mo has her character put aside all of those things. She puts her gear in a pile, cuts herself off from essence so that she can use no charm, no spell, no hearthstone. She refuses to use her manipulation skills to dance around the subject, and brings herself vulnerable and alone to face the thing she has feared most for her whole life. Then she knelt down in front of him and bowed her head and said, "You can kill me if you want, I have put aside everything that could stop you. But if you do so you must face the fact, without any chance of hiding, that you have freely chosen to become what you claim to hate the gods for having made you."<br/><br/>Mo then stopped, cocked her head to one side, and says, "I don't need to roll anything. If he kills her or doesn't, it doesn't matter. Her choice is made, and I'm happy with the story either way." Everyone at the table just sat there for a long moment, with me as GM not having a fucking clue what I was going to do, and just stared. It was a deliberate rejection of everything the character had been about for the first 2/3rds of a two year long story, it was a deliberate rejection of the way Exalted handles task resolution, it was a deliberate rejection of the "we must kill everyone and be ultimate badasses to save the universe" ideology that fills the halls of RPG history. It was the player saying, "This is the story I am telling, this is the story I believe in, this is how I want this game to be, and I want you to finish it in the parameters I've set for you."<br/><br/>She set me up so that she brought the two characters together, set up a crazy dynamic situation in which she was happy and secure, and then basically said to me, "Now you tell me what you think about this, you finish it because I've already finished my part." Because of the momentum of the game I could not stop and let it there, and because she stepped back and left the space there, I had to step in.  Otherwise the game would have sucked. <br/><br/>No flags, pull. <br/><br/>3. Yes. In fact, making responsible pushes is probably easier with a flag. I think the key to the difference between pull and push in regards to a flag has to do with, as Thomas indicates, which part of the flag you are threatening. I think the all too familiar situation where the player makes a character with a beloved whom the GM they murders in the first scene in order to force the PC to go into a revenge story is probably a dysfunctional push where the player was hoping for more of a pull.... But, because I want to avoid the "push=bad" idea like the plauge, let me try one that works. <br/><br/>4. As <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. This time, let me see here.... <br/><br/>Actually, I don't think I need to try hard. Didn't Fred's character in the Nine Worlds game have a flag that had to do with Aegis? If he did (lets just assume so) it meant he wanted Aegis in the situation. But, that doesn't mean he wanted to be arrested and put in prison in the first scene with them. So Matt goes in, takes the flag, and pushes on it to get the arrest. I suppose you could say that Fred had pulled in Aegis, Matt responded to it, and then turned it into a push by taking it in a direction Fred wasn't thinking about.                        </div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>Huh, yea, that's another thing I see a lot of -- when flags get misread. Because there are two reasons I hear players talking about for taking "Best Swordsman Ever" as a trait. The first is because they want to be challanged on their combat skill hard, the second is because they don't want to be challanged to a sword fight at all.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>It might not be an issue for you. It may not be useful to you. <br/><br/>Heck, I know people who have the same response to GNS. Like Tony's (very slick) statement about how in a game that properly supports address of premise there isn't a difference in his eyes between G and N. <br/><br/>For some its a useful distinction, for others it isn't. <br/><br/>Of course, and here is a big secret for all of you, this could because Push and Pull weren't supposed to be a big deal. Mo's orriginal essay was just supposed to be a short little preface to the immersion essay she was going to do. Just a little bit of background about how she sees power interactions at the table before the real meat. Then that bit of background became the point. <br/><br/>Maybe if I can convince her to finish the damn immersion essay it'll make more sense.                        </div>

Pull is encouraging everyone at the table to contribute to the story together, welcoming all input.<br/>
<br/>
Push is using the system to get what you want onto the table, even if it means forcing it down the throat of another player.<br/>

Yeah, I think that in context, the asking players to author some details into the city was pull.  It was all love and support and all of the ideas rocked.<br/>

Dogs in the Vineyard is all Push all the time, ain't it?  I mean, as a GM, I am pushing the NPC's agendas with the dice through the whole town, begging players to take fall-out and/or escalate.                        </div>

I can totally Push stuff at you that I'm not terribly invested in; I can, in fact, Push stuff at you that I know you want Pushed at you.  So too, I can totally Pull you in very manipulative ways to get you to introduce exactly what I want you to introduce.                        </div>

<br/>
I'm not terribly invested in my Dogs NPC's.  I am pushing their agendas because in doing so, I make for a better challenge for the PC's.  I might like an NPC or secretly in my heart of hearts think they are an okay person and the dogs are giving them a rough go, but that's cool, I dig that kind of conflicted loss in DitV.<br/>
<br/>
I'm invested in pushing the PC's to pull their guns and take a stand in the name of the King of Life.<br/>
<br/>
So your Full Light, Full Steam is a non-invested Push?                        </div>

                            Two things.<br/><br/>First, Brand, I wanted to point out this really fascinating thing...
<blockquote>She set me up so that she brought the two characters together, set up a crazy dynamic situation in which she was happy and secure, and then basically said to me, "Now you tell me what you think about this, you finish it because I've already finished my part." Because of the momentum of the game I could not stop and let it there, and because she stepped back and left the space there, I had to step in. Otherwise the game would have sucked.</blockquote>
This looks like a push to me...  Of course I don't have all the context, but... doesn't it look like Mo's action has <i>threatened</i> your sense of a good story?<br/><br/>I mean, that's how it looks from here, and that's <i>totally cool</i>.  See, it looks to me like Mo isn't offering you anything at all here.  Now, that may mean you have to reevaluate your agreement with my threaten/offer thing, or you may just need to provide more context (or just say there's more there, context is a lot of work to present).<br/><br/>Judd,<br/><br/>I think you're where I was about three months ago with this.  Now I think that Push/Pull isn't about getting your way instead of drawing other people in.  It's just a <i>method</i> of getting what you want.  Consider my above note to Brand, it looks (to me) like Mo is using a Push technique to draw input from Brand.<br/><br/>That's where I think things stand anyway.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Maybe push is "I want to decide what happens in this situation, because I find the result more interesting" and pull is "I want you to decide what happens in this situation; I find the situation more interesting."<br/>

                            Damnit, you noisy monkeys, I go away for like 30 minutes to prep for game and come back to 9 new posts.<br/><br/>Judd, <br/><br/>Minus "forcing it down their throat" and "all input" that's at least a big chunk of it. Pull is getting people to bring things, Push is getting others to accept the things you bring, in a lose fashion.  You can guide people with pull (after all the very way you staged your question in the "make up five cool things about the city" guides the possible range of responses at least a little), and you can do push in a way that isn't "down the throat" (like the Fred and Matt example -- they were both going for what they wanted, but there wasn't a "down your throat" aspect either). <br/><br/>Thomas, <br/><br/>No. Because the only way that my story would have been threatened was if I had done nothing at all. Or if no one else at the table had. And anytime you do that you'll have something that sucks. If "the game won't be fun unless you contribute to it" is a threat, then everything we do is because of that threat. <br/><br/>What Mo did is pull me into a place where I could do anything I wanted, within the scope of the situation she'd set up. I had to react, yes, but I wasn't reacting to a threat -- I was reacting to a bribe, or a setup. <br/><br/>Fred, <br/><br/>Yea, that is a big part of what Mo was talking about in the first place. Sometimes you can author your story by chosing to let someone else author a part of it.                        </div>

<p>Now this looks, to my eyes, like what's been defined so far as both Push (I'm strongly contributing my own material and forcing people to accept it) and Pull (I'm leaving a great big horking load of opportunities for them to respond and drawing them into doing so).  Indeed, the harder I push Major Victory the more it Pulls a response.</p>
<p>Are these things supposed to be opposite ends of a spectrum, or are Push and Pull two independent issues?  Can something be neither Push nor Pull, or both Push and Pull?</p>

                            So, in my understanding, push and pull are both ways of getting people to respond.  Therefore, you're pushing to make them react to Major Victory, not just pushing the concept.  They're different ways of eliciting a response.  I kindof like to think of it as pushing someone to respond when they don't want to vs. pulling them to respond of their own volition.  An example:<br/>
<br/>
"hey do you want to come over and hang out or something?"<br/>
"hey do you want to come over and hang out or something?  come on, you know you want to!"<br/>
<br/>
The latter is pushing, the former isn't.  The difference isn't always an additional sentence, sometimes it's just the way you state something.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you want to come over tonight?"<br/>
"Hey!  Why don't you come over tonight?"<br/>
<br/>
The latter is -- if not pushing -- very close to it.  It forces someone to come up with a reason/excuse not to come over if they don't want to, whereas the first doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>My take is that you've been confused by the different views of what push and pull are.  I'm going to jump up and down and point to mine again, since I think it's the only one that is both coherent and useful.  (In fact, I find the "I'm contributing" vs "I'm getting you to contribute" divide to be a complete red herring.)<br/><br/>So, ask yourself, what are you doing?  You are, at least as far as I can tell, threatening the player with having their character look ridiculous.  In that sense you are pushing.  Whenever you drop goals to make their character's wear hot pants, you're pushing them to fight you.<br/><br/>At the same time, you're pulling players.  Specifically, you are using your characterization to make people want something.  What do they want?  They want to see Major Victory get what's coming to him.  He's such a self-righteous prick that everyone actively wants him to get slapped down.<br/><br/>I'll also note that this is a great way to teach <i>Capes</i>.  You're generating a desire, and then you tell people how to fulfill it ("Oh, all you have to do is spend an action to create a Goal").  You push people to fight you, and then you pull people to create new arenas to fight you in.<br/><br/>They appear to be the same thing, but I don't think they are.  In the one case, you are threatening their characters with looking dumb.  In the other case you are offering them the chance to put Major Victory in his place.  It is, of course, really dang interesting that these are so tightly linked, but I think that they're still distinct things.<br/><br/>Does that match up with your experience?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>Thomas:  Nope.  I don't see the distinction that you're drawing ... like, at all.</p>
<p><code>Pushing is trying to get someone to do something by threatening something they want to keep safe. Pulling is about trying to get someone to do something by offering them something they desire to have.</code></p>
<p>So what happens when, in a single moment, I clearly convey the following:  "If I win then you have to be Major Victory's sidekick, but if you win then you get to tell him off and leave him sobbing in the gutter"?</p>
<p>Your two categories are not distinct.  Single actions can be both Push and Pull by your definition.  Almost every time you're setting hard Stakes, you're offering both an opportunity and a threat.</p>
<p>So if you're cool with Push and Pull happening at the same time then let's discuss it in that context.  But if you want to argue that a Push can't be a Pull abd a Pull can't be a Push then I'm still not convinced.</p>

<p>Uh ... doesn't that put Push and Pull into the eye of the beholder?  Like, if I ask you "Hey, you wanna come over tonight?  We're watching movies," and I'm trying to be deadpan, but you hear it as "Hey!  You WANNA come over tonight!  We're watching moooOOOooovies!" in a cajoling tone then I'm Pulling but you're being Pushed?</p>

                            I agree with Thomas that the whole "inviting player input" is a red herring.  ALL good play invites player input.  That's just good play.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is in technique -- how do we invite input?<br/>
<br/>
When I play Polaris and I go "And so it was that Sir Arcturus returned from the war to find his wife and children slaughtered by the demon One Thousand Dawns Each Alike," that's a push.  Am I inviting player input?  Damned straight I am.<br/>
<br/>
When I play Polaris and I go "hey, dude, why don't you frame the scene for your Sir Arcturus this time," that's a pull.  It's a different means of inviting player input.<br/>

<p>Did you know that, in physics, there's no such thing as suction?  It's true.  You cannot apply force by creating a vacuum.  The only thing you can do is <em>remove one of a pair of balanced forces</em>, in this case air pressure on one side of an object that is normally the exact balance to the air pressure on the other side of the object.</p>
<p>Now that <em>looks</em> like applying force through suction, until you get right down to it and examine things closely ... and then you find out that you were wrong the whole time.</p>
<p>I'm seriously considering the possibility that Push and Pull don't exist, and that the reason I don't get it but other people do is that the other people are wrong.  I'm not dead-set on that yet, but I will say that this thread is pushing (or perhaps pulling) me very strongly in that direction.  The more people explain, the less it all seems to make sense.  Just FYI.</p>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>This may seem pedantic, but I promise I don't intend it to be:
<blockquote>So what happens when, in a single moment, I clearly convey the following: "If I win then you have to be Major Victory's sidekick, but if you win then you get to tell him off and leave him sobbing in the gutter"?</blockquote>
Notice the "if... but if..." there?  That makes the sentence disjunctive.  You're actually making <i>two different statements</i>.  You're doing them in the same breath, and possibly even in the same game-action, but they're not a unified thing.<br/><br/>So, yeah, you can push and pull someone at the same time.  In fact, I was trying to point that out in the context of <i>Capes</i> earlier.  Think about it like this: you want to <i>win</i> any given conflict because it will give you an Inspiration.  You want to <i>lose</i> many (but not all) conflicts because that will earn you Story Tokens.  You want to <i>win</i> or <i>lose</i> specific conflicts based on which fictional outcome you prefer.  All of that is pulling you in all sorts of directions at once.<br/><br/>Then at the same time you want to <i>win</i> conflicts to get rid of debt.  And you want to <i>win</i> conflicts to prevent other people from doing stuff you don't want to the fiction.  That's pushing.<br/><br/>Can you be under pressure from both at the same time?  Sure!  But any single thing can only do one or the other.  Is that clearer?<br/><br/>EDIT: Crossposted with Tony above.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>Thomas, it's clearer, but I think it is (though very much well-intentioned) mistaken.</p>
<p>I'm making a disjunctive statement <strong>to you people</strong> to make clear what's happening.  In Capes, I would just throw down a 3x5 card on which is written "Goal:  Major Victory convinces Spark-boy to join on as his sidekick!" and that would communicate the same thing.</p>
<p>And, in fact, even <em>that</em> would be the elaborated version of the dynamic ... the very first iteration, which spends extra time (to the tune of two seconds reading the card) in establishing the stakes.  When I later pick up a debt token and place it on the card, am I pushing or pulling?  I am, in that physical movement, both threatening to contest the goal more powerfully <strong>and</strong> setting up several types of possible reward for the other players to pursue.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like that is both Push (threatening to take away something they value) and Pull (offering a reward they can pursue).  What do you think?</p>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Sure, dumping debt on a conflict is pushing and pulling, or at least <i>it can be</i>.  In fact, it's always pulling (offering story tokens, which are defaulted as valuable) in the context of the game, but I'm sure you can imagine some players who don't care about them, maybe because they have too many already, or maybe just because they don't care.  In that case the debt isn't a pull.<br/><br/>At the same time, Major Victory making Spark-boy his side-kick might not be a push either.  I mean, maybe as Spark-boy's player I think that's a totally awesome way to take the story.<br/><br/>All that's just me saying "context matters" again, so let's just assume this is a typical situation in which the action is a push and a pull.  That's fine.  I think part of the confusion may be coming from thinking of push and pull as physical actions, they're not, they're social actions.  You can convey multiple social meanings in a single physical action.  Heck, consider the words "I love you", they do more than express love.<br/><br/>I guess I'm saying "Yeah, you can push and pull at the same time, but recognize that you're not doing one thing."  You may still think that that's crazy, but hey...<br/><br/>Also!  One thing about my conception of the push/pull distinction that I think might not be in sync with everyone else's is that I think you can make statements that are neither.  Sometimes when you say "My guy opens the door" you aren't pushing or pulling, you're just making a statement.  I think there's been some confusion because people are trying to classify statements that are not intended to generate a response as pushing or pulling, while I think some statements are just statements.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>I feel like we're going in weird places with all this talk about threat and input and so forth; it's a social dynamic so we should think of it at that level.</p>
<p>My suspicion is (oversimplified): Pushing invites opposition, while pulling invites collusion. Crucially, they both draw in another player's input, but they differ with respect to how it interacts with what has gone before.</p>

<p>Okay, I've got a <em>follow-up</em> question.</p>
<p>Three different, actual, instances of play:  They both begin the same way, with me adding "Goal:  Convince X to become Major Victory's sidekick," and playing it for all its obnoxious worth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah reviles Major Victory, inventing a sordid past wherein he has repeatedly been accused of abusing his sidekicks.  </li>
<li>Becca says "Uh ... no, I don't think I want to do that," but does not step up to oppose it.  </li>
<li>Rob says "Okay.  What sort of pay and benefits does being your sidekick offer?" and opens negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Was I <em>doing different things</em>, as regards Push and Pull, when I ran my standard Major Victory script for these different people?  In short, is it only possible to evaluate Push or Pull after you know how the other player responds?</p>

I think you've got the essence of something imoprtant, but your missing a key bit.  It's not how they <i>respond</i>, but how they <i>perceive</i> your action.  That is, you may try to push, but it falls flat, or maybe it's a pull, you can't know without the extremely specific context of the players at the table.<br/><br/>But, like I said, it's not about how they respond.  You may threaten (push), but they hide that.  It's not all that functional in the types of play I perceive you (and me) to like, but it is a response.<br/><br/>So, in short, yeah, you were doing different things.  In the exact same way that me saying to my mother "I love you" means something different from  me saying to my (hypothetical) girlfriend "I love you".  Context is king.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<blockquote>So ... I know nothing about any of these people. You get that, right? I'm running a demo script for people who walk up to the table. We have zero pre-existing relationship.</blockquote>
Now, this is an exaggeration.  Of course you know something about these people.  First, they're people,  More usefully, they're Americans, they're the sort of people who attend conventions, etc.  There are all sorts of visual cues that you can automatically process to pick out things like sub-culture and shared values.  Still, you're right that you do not <i>know</i> these people, which just means that your attempts to push may fail.
<blockquote>Given that, do you see how it is hard for me to answer questions about how the initial conditions differed from my point of view? From my point of view the initial conditions were absolutely identical.</blockquote>
Well, one thing that you're ignoring (and to be fair, I've been ignoring it for silly rhetorical reasons) is that you know how to read people.  It's a pretty basic social skill.  You can watch as your annoying Major Victory voice and physical posing grate on nerves and generate dislike.  You can watch people's reactions to Major Victory and guage <i>just the right player</i> to hit with the sidekick goal.<br/><br/>On top of that, you have this wonderful set of shared cultural markers.  The players you've got are (likely) Americans and (again, likely) gamers, and (again, likely) somewhat familiar with comic books.  So, while you may not know anything about these people, you can make some highly accurate assumptions about how they will react in general.  Then you can use your social skills to fine-tune your assessment of reactions, and adjust your plans accordingly.<br/><br/>Basically, context matters, but it turns out that we (as humans) tend to be pretty good at picking context up out of social situations.  It's something we do all the time.  Sure, you'll make mistakes, but that can happen even if you really know someone well.
<blockquote>Now, Thomas: You said something I find very interesting. You said that whether I am Pushing or Pulling is defined by how others perceive my action ... even if I'm doing exactly the same thing. Is that right?</blockquote>
Tony, yep.  I'm aware that it seems a bit odd, but it turns out to be more linguistically intuitive than the reverse.  See, as (I think) I've shown upthread, using my definition of the distinction sometimes you think you're pulling, but you're not.  You say to yourself, "Aha!  I have just the thing to draw them out!" and then it flops.  So, pretty clearly, it's possible, maybe even common, for one party to think that they're executing a push or pull, and the other party to perceive the action differently.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then we need to be able to talk about what's happening when you try to push (or pull) but it's perceived as either nothing of interest or the opposite action.  The two options I see us having there are "I tried to push/pull him, but instead I pulled/pushed him." or "I pushed/pulled him, but he thought I was pulling/pushing him."  Or, using the more defined threatened/bribed dichotemy: "I tried to bribe him, but he felt threatened instead" vs "I bribed him, but he felt like I was threatening and reacted as if I was."<br/><br/>It seems to be just plain odd to me to talk as if the person reacting is <i>wrong</i> about what prompted the reaction.  "Dude, you may have felt threatened, but I was totally bribing you" seems like something of a nonsensical response.  It makes more sense to me to talk about things as a failure to properly assess what is a threat and what is a bribe.<br/><br/>All that aside, I still think the push/pull distinction is useful.  There are some socio-cultural reasons for this (about how we tend to communicate, and the sorts of settings we use each mode in outside of gaming, and stuff like that), but I don't think anything I've said above makes it any harder to do, really.  It's just as easy to talk about <i>trying</i> to push, and the sorts of things that <i>tend</i> to push.  In many cases we'll be right too.  I mean, as you pointed out above, (almost?) every time you toss the "Make Spark-boy into Major Victory's sidekick" on the table people react as if threatened.<br/><br/>That side-kick thing?  That strongly tends to be a push, but you see how in some contexts it's not, right?  I mean, you can see how someone might be at the table and they get this glow in their eyes, and they just can't wait to start acting sanctimonious and self-righteous too!<br/><br/>So, after spending an entire thread repeating "context matters" over and over under my breath (and aloud, when I felt like it), I'm also saying "But remember, when we're playing actual games, we have context to draw from, and more than that, we can anticipate the sort of people who will play our games, so there's some context, and even more than that, we know what sorts of interactions <i>often</i> produce either push or pull."<br/><br/>Man, that's rambly...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some interesting discussion going on here, which I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to derail by adding my own example, but hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some actual play.<br/>
<br/>
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from an email game.  In the history of the game world, a massively important event involved one character using a form of magical communication and transportation to contact another and bring them into his presence.  And then he stabbed this character in the gut and broke the universe with his spilt blood.  HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considered a bad guy and is now dead.  The entire game is about the consequences of that.<br/>
<br/>
A while ago, my character was learning how to use the same magical communication, under the instruction of the protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©e and ward of the original stabber.  This teacher is now considered reasonably trustworthy and innocent of the bad guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans.  My character doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know him from Adam and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust him either, since he just kidnapped her and claimed it was really a rescue.  SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very scared, but going along with things in the meantime.  She cooperates with the lesson, but as she does so, she subtly mimes stabbing her teacher in the guts, to work out the feasibility of protecting herself that way should she ever be attacked through this crazy magic stuff.  She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the history or the people involved.<br/>
<br/>
The player of the teacher has previously set up his characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loyalty as a bit ambiguous, and also enjoyed giving the character attitudes that make people question how much he really denounces what his former patron did.<br/>
<br/>
I threw out the resonance with a past significant event to see if anyone wanted to make something of it.  Nobody has yet, but because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an email game, things move slowly, and it may still happen.  Maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll end up on the side of the bad guys because someone saw this and decided it would be interesting to tempt her that way?  Maybe something else?  It felt like Pull to me.<br/>
<br/>
And now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try for a Push example from character creation in the same game.  The game is run using modified Everway rules, and characters have a Fate card.  In this game I decided I was interested in the tension between power derived from bloodlines, the desire to belong, and the desire to be self-made.  I picked The Fool as my characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fate card.  Now that issue has to show up in the game.<br/>

<p>Thomas:  This whole "Context matters" thing?  I think it's a circular argument that basically turns your entire definition of Push/Pull into meaningless pedantry.  Here's why.</p>
<p>People (you included, I do believe) are offering me Push/Pull as a tool for understanding my own behavior and how it effects others.  "See, Tony, when you Pull it entices people with the offer of something they want, and so they pursue it, but when you Push it engages people with the threat of something they don't want, and so they resist.  So if you want them to pursue then you should pull, but if you want them to resist then you should push."</p>
<p>So I say "Okay, so how do I Pull?  How do I know when I'm doing it?  How do I get better at doing it?"  Reasonable questions, yes?</p>
<p>And I get the response "Well, you can't really choose to do it ... it's up to the people on the other end.  If they perceive you as offering something they want, and they pursue it, then you're Pulling.  If they perceive you as threatening something they don't want and they resist then you're Pushing."</p>
<p>Which means that your argument, when expanded is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other players perceive you as offering something they want, and pursue it, that's a good way to entice people with the offer of something they want, so they'll pursue it, and...  </li>
<li>If the other players perceive you as threatening them with something they don't want, and resist it, that's a good way to engage them with the threat of something they don't want, so they'll resist it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is a meaningless circular definition.</p>
<p>I could do meaningless circular definitions too, if I were so inclined ... I could say things like:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>There's an important distinction between entertaining your players and distracting them.  Entertaining will help your players have happy lives outside of the game by filling them with joy, while distracting them will make them miserable by giving them a way to avoid solving their own problems.  Oh ... you want to know how to tell the difference between entertaining and distracting?  Well, context is king.  If the players are happy outside of the game then you've been entertaining them, but if they're miserable then you've been distracting them.  If so, you better stop that right away, you jerk!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, Thomas ... you're being a tremendous sport about discussing this, and I respect you greatly as a person because of that.  I want to make absolutely clear that it's your <em>ideas</em> I object to, not you personally.  People get confused about that very easily, so I wanted to make it infinitely clear.  I disagree with you as respecting, friendly peers can and will disagree on points they hold passionately.  Are we cool?</p>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>We're cool man!  If you were privy to some of the "fights" I have with locals, you wouldn't be worried.  I mean, I love games and all, but the stuff we fight over over dinner and such around here <i>really</i> matters.<br/><br/>Claire,<br/><br/>Before I get back to Tony, I wanted to say thanks for dropping your experience in here.  I've got to ask though: when you dropped the little bit about the stabbing into the game, were you hoping to provoke a reaction, or were you just sort of tossing an idea out there, or where you thinking of some specific person who you thought would really love to play with it?  I'm guessing, from what you said, that it was just a general, "Hmm...  I'll make a little opening and see what happens...", but I want to make sure.<br/><br/>Tony (again),<br/><br/>So, looking back upthread it's clear that I've been somewhat obtuse.  Part of this is because I'm fighting "context matters" battles all over the place these days, and I sort of have to establish that as a ground rule before I feel able to move on.<br/><br/>So!  Let's look to some applied examples of Push and Pull <i>in game design</i>.<br/><br/><i>Capes</i> has a number of strong mechanical pulls: Story Tokens and Inspirations are the two obvious ones.  These are things that <i>people want</i> and the system offers them for certain behaviors.  Thus the mechanics of the game pull people toward certain behaviors.  (Note, and this is something that we sometimes forget, some people find mechanical rewards uninteresting.  This is the context thing again: some people will not actually find themselves enticed to work to gain Story Tokens.  For these people Story Tokens are not a pull.)<br/><br/>Look at my little aside above.  Context matters, but the <i>majority</i> of players will react in predictable ways.  Thus, thinking of Story Tokens as a pull mechanic is valid.  Because it pulls most players.<br/><br/>I think the problem here is that, when talking about push/pull, we can only talk about trends and tendencies.  That means that diagnosing <i>any specific</i> interaction as one or the other requires more context than can really be conveyed effeciently via pure text without a significant vocabulary in interpersonal communications.  I mean, I don't even know how to tell you the significance of idiosyncratic pauses in my speech, or cadence reading, or anything like that.  Those are the sorts of things that we interpret at intuitive levels, and it's with those things that we determine "Oho!  She's ripe for a side-kick challenge!  If I had dropped it five minutes ago it might have flopped, but I've got her hooked now!"<br/><br/>It may be the case that actual play examples are going to be hard to analyze like this...  Isn't that interesting...<br/><br/>Oh, one other thing.  Shreyas mentioned over in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> (but the slacker hasn't stopped by the thread to repeat it) that instead of threats and bribes, push may be about actions taken trying to get someone else to oppose you, while pull is about actions taken trying to get someone else to ally themselves with you.  I'm not sure I like the definition, but I am sure I'd love to discuss it with anyone else who's interested.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Tony, don't listen to Thomas.  The reason that you're confused is because he's mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
Of course a push or a pull can fail.  Failing doesn't make it not-push or not-pull.<br/>
<br/>
Push and pull have to do with the setting up of a situation and with the setting of stakes and with shining the spotlight, not with engagement or resolution.  By the time you get to engagement or resolution, the push or pull has already happened.  Push and pull are methods of getting engagement.  If the person you are pushing or pulling does not engage, then the push or pull has failed, but that doesn't make it any less a push or pull.<br/>
<br/>
In both a push and a pull, you are inviting opposition.<br/>
<br/>
GM: You open the vault door.  Sitting on a pedestal, just ten feet from your eager hands, lies the Jewel of Destiny, shining a beautiful green in the darkness.<br/>
<br/>
PLAYER 1 (pushing): "I grab it first!"<br/>
PLAYER 2 (engaging the push): "No, I do!"<br/>
<br/>
Player 1 is inviting player 2 to get into a conflict over who gets there first.<br/>
<br/>
or...<br/>
GM (pulling): Which of you will take the Jewel, and with it control of the land of D'Angelis, and the enmity of Lord Rot?                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I fear that I may have derailed the useful parts of our discussion with semantics.  Currently I'm calling something a push or a pull if it <i>results</i> in a certain kind of response (as you have pointed out above), and I am calling it "trying to push/pull" when someone takes an action <i>intending</i> to generate a certain response.<br/><br/>It may be easier to assign the <i>intent</i> part the primary label if for no other reason than it's the part that's most useful to us.  The thing is, you can't control what sort of response you will receive, only influence it.  That's where all the techniques lie: in learning how to generate the responses you want successfully.<br/><br/>And, man, I want to participate in a thread about that.techniques and practice.  But when Judd started this thread, lo those many posts ago, he was asking for a definition through actual play examples.  Then I jumped in screaming and waving my arms proclaiming that I am unsure that you can successfully demonstrate push-y-ness or pull-y-ness with accuracy, at least not without a couple thousand words to establish context.<br/><br/>Now, it's at this point that I have to sit back, think, and admit that my still-somewhat-nebulous idea has been inherently confusing.  I've been saying "pushes are threats" (which looks like it's labeling intent) and then saying "pushes are actions that get someone to respond as if threatened" (clearly response-based).  This brings us to an interesting ambiguity in language: when you try to threaten someone, and they do not find you threatening, are you actually "threatening" them?<br/><br/>Anyway, moving back to the point, I assume the objections you feel I missed were that I was making circular arguments?  If so, then my intended answer was this:
<blockquote>Context matters, but the majority of players will react in predictable ways.</blockquote>
Which, restated, says "There are no rules for pushing/pulling better or worse, but I bet we can come up with good guidelines."  Maybe people sitting forward in their chairs is a good sign that you're pulling them?  Maybe them crossing their arms is a good sign that their pushed?  Maybe when they jump in and interrupt you they're being pushed?<br/><br/>That stuff I don't know yet.  I guess part of my problem (which results in much rambling) in this thread is you seem to be asking "How do I learn to recognize the sorts of things my fellow players will find threatening so I can push them about those things, and how do I recognize the sorts of things my fellow players will desire, so I can pull them?"  And I'm sitting here scratching my head and thinking, "Uh...  I sort of do that intuitively.  I mean, learning when you are being threatnening and recognizing things that might be threatening is a basic social skill, right?"<br/><br/>If that's <i>not</i> what you're asking, well...  Gee, don't I feel sheepish.<br/><br/>Oh, and Fred's right that push and pull are about generating engagement.  If I said anything that implied otherwise, I'm terribly sorry.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>It takes two to tango.</p>
<p>The whole "Push/Pull" phrasing seems (to my mind) to assume that the person who Pushes or Pulls is the one causing everything that follows.  By pulling Bob <strong>induces</strong> Ann to choose a certain path.  Oh sure, <em>technicallly</em> Ann chooses that on her own, but we're not going to pay attention to little technicalities like that, because we're talking about Bob and what he does.  Ann is just a bystander.</p>
<p>It is, no doubt, a very gratifying fantasy to the people who feel that they're Pushing and Pulling all of the other players ... that they are, even for a moment, the Prime Movers in their own little universe.  But it's not true.  The truth is a good deal more complex than that, and the Push/Pull phrasing hides that truth behind a seductive illusion.</p>

I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thinking of <b>a</b> specific person, but there were probably half a dozen people I imagined it might appeal to.  There are a number of players engaged with that sensitive issue, while my character isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t directly.  By doing what I did, I was flagging my interest in playing around with some of that stuff, by offering other people the chance to use it somehow for dramatic irony.<br/><br/>Because of the pace of the game, I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expecting an immediate reaction, more something 6 months down the line<br/><br/>Tony,<br/><br/>My take on your Major Victory thing is that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strong Pull.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a much stronger Push.  And in response to this, Sarah pushes back.  Becca doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really respond, and your Push fails to get a real response using the system at that time.  Rob Pulls and effectively says Ã¢â‚¬Å“Major VictoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a berk, ok, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play with that and what else would you like to do with this messed up sidekick relationship?Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>In the cases of Sarah and Rob, your effort is successful.  In BeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work, she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happy about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening, but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t respond to it in a way that is effective.<br/><br/>I get the impression that you action is being called a Pull because the mechanics of Capes invite players to suggest alternative outcomes.  If Capes worked so that you lay down the Ã¢â‚¬Å“You become Major VictoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sidekickÃ¢â‚¬Â goal, and then independently the player had an opportunity to pose another conflict with stakes that were potentially motivated by dislike of Major Victory, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d see it as pretty much pure Push.  However, I understand that one of the strengths of Capes is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a game that plays best when players are aggressive, and Push lots, but the mechanics include a bit of Pull in every time this happens.  So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Pull in the sense that every conflict in Capes is a Pull, because each invites players to propose counter stakes.  So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great example.<br/><br/>IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d see your Major Victory example as a much stronger Pull if you kept playing him as obnoxious until someone else proposed a goal about giving him his comeuppance, rather than in response to your own goal.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure I have an authoritative understanding.<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

<p>Okay ... had a private and productive talk with Thomas.  I'll let him talk about what he took away, I'm going to talk about what I took away.</p>
<p>I still don't think that either Push or Pull exist in the ways they're being described.  The notion of "I do this, and the other person responds, but really it's only me doing it ... pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!" still doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>But there <strong>is</strong> stuff that is local one player ... the calculations that occur relative to their internal model of another player.</p>
<p>Bob cannot, alone, Push Ann to react.  But Bob can, alone, think about his model of how Ann thinks, and try to figure out (purely in his own head) what she'll do in response to various stimuli.  That's all inside of one person, and so I think it's fair to talk about it as something that one person <em>does</em>.</p>
<p>So ... actual play.  I have two instances in the same game.  A mid-teens girl came to a demo on the arm of her RPGing boyfriend.  She made up a femme fighter martial-artsy character, but didn't engage with very much.  Here's the two things I thought, and the predictions I made about what little I could deduce of her character and motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>She's uncomfortable here.  I can see it in her body language, in the way her eyes move, in the patterns of her speech.  Bunch of guys doing this game in a guy-ish manner.  Nobody's commenting on the fact that she's the only girl here.  Nobody's commenting on her gender at all.  It's the elephant in the room ... we all have to keep moving around it, but nobody talks about it.  I suspect that if I attack her character on the basis of her gender, if I say "Oh, your character is a girl, so she's not tough enough to fight super-villains, you better stay on the sidelines" she will lock on that precise conceptual target and keep blasting at it until it's dust.</p></li>
<li><p>Later ... She's grooving on causing my character suffering.  He's a safe outlet, she's got him completely cowed.  If I decide that Kid Faust has totally fallen for her and desperately wants her to go out with him, she will grab that and use it as a launch-pad to explore realms of creative torture that I can't even begin to anticipate or control.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I am deliberately <strong>not</strong> informing you of what I did and how she reacted, and the whole dynamic of that ... because I could only give a one-sided account of the two-person tango.  Any such report would be inherently incomplete.  But I can give you the above, which is my one-person report of a purely one-person juggling act that happened in my own head.  They seem to bear <em>some</em> resemblance to things that people are talking about in terms of Push and Pull ... only from a more manageable, reportable, verifiable standpoint of what <strong>I, personally</strong> know that I felt and thought.</p>
<p>I'd be very interested in discussions (perhaps in another thread) about what techniques we utilize, inside our own heads, as we try to learn about other people in this way.  I think that could be a very fruitful subject for discussion.</p>
<p>As I said to Thomas (and I admit that this is a prediction driven by my egotism) I believe that if we follow that question of "How do we figure out people, how is it that we think about them thinking, and how can we do it better?" for a while then the question of "Push and Pull" will fade away as our <em>entry point</em> to the bigger questions, but of no interest whatsoever on its own.</p>

                            Tony, you push.  All the time, pretty much.  Not a problem; that's how you operate.  It's possible that's why you can't see the difference between push and pull.  You're just so used to operating one way that it blocks out how to see or operate another.<br/>

<p>If Mo wants to get in on the discussion then I'll listen to what she thinks too.  Otherwise why should I worry about it?  I'm not discussing <em>her</em> opinions.  I'm talking with the people who are present in the conversation.</p>

                            Well, at least the ongoing discussion is helping me understand things better.  Like faerieloch said, I think Tony's been pushing this entire thread.  "Here's my position!  Now MAKE me back down!  If you want me to change my mind, you'd better convince the hell out of me!"  His social body is taking up a hell of a lot of the shared space here.  (Sorry, Tony, if I'm caricaturing you in the quote, but an exaggerated position might help me make things clearer to other people.)  Pull, on the other hand, is . . . softer.  It would be more like saying, "Hey, here's something interesting, come take a position on it."  It's offering the shared possibility space to someone else to define, while still taking an active role by helping define the bounds of that space.<br/><br/>I still may not quite have it down, but like I said before, I'm going to keep periodically hitting this concept with my head until my head develops doors with which to let it in.  Unlike Tony, I do believe the concept is valuable, which is why I'm trying to disentangle it from some of the other stuff that's going on.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Excellent thread and a very important concept discussion, even if it turns into vapor somewhere down the line. My gut tells me that isn't the case.<br/><br/>Actual play examples:<br/><br/>1. Your PC has a friend who is the subject of an ancient vendetta. Those sworn to the vendetta cannot forsake their vengeance per the magic of the eternal oath. Later you find out your friend is pregnant with your child. The unborn child will also now become subject to the vendetta.<br/><br/>The plot element of the vendetta adding danger to the story is push.<br/><br/>2. Your PC finds out that the assistance rendered by an Old Man is because of events that happened before you were born. The Old Man's advice and minor assists help you understand many things about the past, including how the Old Man ties into your family history.<br/><br/>The Old Man also mentions that at some point, your family will owe him a return favor.<br/><br/>The information and mystery addition to the story is a pull.                        </div>

                            I was trying to see if context was such a driver or whether simple ideas could be push / pull.<br/><br/>But I'll respond:<br/><br/>The first example was used to rachet up the investment and engagement with a NPC that the PC had found charismatic at introduction. The PC released the NPC from durance vile and later found out that this act of good had reawakened the Vendetta pointed at the NPC.<br/><br/>At several levels, this is push in my opinion. PC never has enough info to have foreseen issues now causing more engagement with same NPC. The vendetta wasn't on the table until the NPC was freed from 'stasis'. Another layer of push gets added when the two characters later find out the NPC is pregnant. This 'shared blood' becomes both an emotional issue and one of peril.<br/><br/>While the PC had all the choices, the increase is peril is imposed by events running just 'outside' or parallel to the choices made. The Player is finding the plot more engrossing, but it has become a rollercoaster of more limited choices.<br/><br/>The second example is much more about choices expanding. Also the technique of delivery is informed and informing at both PC and Player levels. Here there is both foreshadowing (there will be a price later) and useful antecedants to other issues that may not be problems now. If the Old Man knows Useful A, he may know something about Useful C, so engaging him as a ally may tip other things into favorable light.<br/><br/>Many more questions and avenues are opening, but the PC may refuse the association completely.<br/><br/>While the PC may refuse the association in the first example, look how personally painful it will be and how horrid events will look from a decent perspective.                        </div>

<i>Frankly, I don't think it's going to come out of a thread that is rolling in this particular mode of discourse, but you're all welcome to try.</i><br/><br/>Hmmmm. Totally fair, cause I know that I don't post much on RPGNet or Nutkinsack or wherever because I just don't like stepping in that pool either.<br/><br/>I'm thinking, though, would you maybe consider opening a new thread in a bit (today, tomorrow, next week, etc) to explain it?<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, for a bunch of folks it feels like the whole "Push and Pull" thing was just an off-hand comment made in a hasty blog entry that has been since sorta made more than what it originally indicated (hence the lack of Actual Play to back it up, etc).<br/><br/>I know that in lots of places, old-school Forgespeak got taken behind the shed for a beating because a lot of it couldn't be shown in Actual Play examples, it was all interpreted, misinterpreted, reinterpreted continuously on a sliding plane: Like how some people use the word "Narrativist" to describe a game where you simply "describe your to-hit actions more when making an attack roll", etc.<br/><br/>I think that when we see the examples above, we see that, yes, <b>SOMETHING</b> there is happening, something worth describing and talking about (especially since it seems to enhance particular types of play).<br/><br/>In my observations of this thread and other Push/Pull discussions, we're seeing about 6 or 8 different things (Observable Game-table Behaviors) being discussed under the Push/Pull umbrella, each person stepping forth, taking the set they're familiar with, describing THOSE as the REAL Push/Pull, then stepping back, only to have the next person step forward and choose a different pair to be referred to as Push/Pull. No one's really being all one-wayist when making their own connections (I see a lot of "I thought that Push Pull was this: (example)"), but there certainly is a lot of confusion. <br/><br/>The problem is that we don't have words for all of these behaviors, so they're all falling under the umbrella, and kinda jumbling up the whole mess.<br/><br/>So... who came up with the term again? Was it Mo? Was it Vincent? I forget. What I'd like to do, to make all this relavent, is this: Find whomever came up with the term, politely ask them to Very Clearly (if possible) state, with say 2 concrete "dialogue/script" Real Play examples Per Term (that is, 2 for Push, 2 for Pull), and drop them in a new thread here. Then that would be It. No questions. No comments. Case closed on What is Push and What is Pull.<br/><br/>THEN, we can move on from there in another thread, and take all these other Behaviors that we see above (again, demonstrable game-enhancing stuff, it's not just all talk), the other 4-6 things that we see people talk about that now are seen to NOT be Push/Pull, and take those apart: Come up with names for them. Classify them. Find relations. Get them all polished and termed and ready to be used by the next designer in their game designs.<br/><br/>Does that sound cool, or at least worthwhile?<br/><br/>Now, here's the thing, asking Vincent (Mo? Again, I forgot who orignally coined the terms) to take their time to address what they were looking at in the manner above (4 total actual play examples - and by this I mean "example scripts from the gaming table", these aren't events that necisserily Actually Happened) is a little off-putting, so I'll throw in $5 (Paypal) to the original author to take their time to do so for us. That's just for their time. I think it's worth it to sort of settle things and get us from talking about things that May or May Not Be Push/Pull, and help us classify all those other cool behaviors as well.<br/><br/>If the original blog post from whence it all originated was just a kind of well-meaning brainfart and the original author doesn't want to go back and try to be exacting with the terms, that's absolutely 100% totally cool, too. Because then we'll have a clean slate from which we can take ALL the behaviors above, describe them each as basic and simple as possible, and come up with names for them, in much the same way that Jason polled people for names for his Drowning and Falling game. I think this will sort of settle the conversation a little, and allow us to take these tools that people are referring to (which are currently UnNamed, or at least miscategorized into the metaphysics of "Push/Pull") and make them ready for insertion into the games we play.<br/><br/>So, to get things started... who came up with the terms originally again? What's the link to the original blog post where it all started?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Everyone,<br/><br/>Here's something it would have been valuable for me to disclose way back at the beginning: I am doing Mo something of a dis-service (sorry, Mo!).  Specifically, I am operating under the assumption that Mo has identified a social dynamic that we recognize intuitively without being able to articulate the difference between the two.  That is, I am basically assuming that Mo can't explain it to my own satisfaction.<br/><br/>Now, it should be admitted that this is my own arrogance here.  I've been struggling with push/pull literally since the first blog entry, and I've been asking questions of both Mo and Brand, probably to the point of aggravation.  Yet, I feel that neither of them have been able to explain it to me.  So instead of considering that I might just be a big dummy, I'm assuming that no one actually has a coherent, comprehensive definition.<br/><br/>Looking back, I realize that this is likely <i>ridiculously</i> offensive, despite the fact that I don't mean it to be.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for both Mo and Brand, and I'm not really convinced that I understand Push/Pull better than they do, but I am convinced that they don't understand the distinction well enough to teach it to me.<br/><br/>The end result of all this is that I'm vitually positive that what I think Push/Pull is is <i>not</i> the same thing that Mo is thinking of, and that may be really confusing the discussion (I know that in our conversation, Tony was objecting to things about Push/Pull that had been mentioned by Mo earlier that I think are emphatically <i>not</i> part of the dynamic).<br/><br/>Which means that... wow...  I sort of thread-jacked this thing, for which I apologize.<br/><br/>So, at this poing, I'm going to step back and bow out of the thread.  I've got a blog post scheduled for this Thursday in which I'm hoping to lay out what I do really think, and I want to disengage from the discussion in order to let my mind settle.  I get unproductively defensive (which is terrible, I know), and it takes me a couple of days to actually assimilate points made by other people into my own thinking.<br/><br/>But, hey, it's not like you can't continue without me!  And, hopefully, walking away, and taking my argumentative style with me, will encourage some other people (Mo?  Whoever else?) that it's safe to get involved...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, <br/><br/>I'd actually argue against the "authority" angle of the argument.<br/><br/>Mo had an idea, it was a setup to another idea. She wrote the idea down. People liked and disliked the idea. People started doing their own things with the idea. Then the idea got moved outside what Mo had been talking about in the first place. Then people wanted Mo to talk about "what the idea really meant." Other people don't care what Mo meant, and want to do their own thing (even if that is nothing) with the idea. <br/><br/>Well, you know, that's pretty much the whole history of philosophy right there. But I've always been against the authority in philosophy, and I'm against it here -- even if the authority is my wife. <br/><br/>You don't see eye-to-eye with Mo about P&amp;P, but that's okay, because I don't see eye-to-eye with Mo about P&amp;P. (We're close, but we've never been 100% in agreement, and that probably creates confusion too.) <br/><br/>When ideas birth other ideas, and when people start using ideas to do their own thing, and spur their own thoughts, and move off in their own directions... that's a good thing. At least so long as people recognize and accept that is what they are doing. <br/><br/>So if you want to talk about force interactions in terms of threat, that's great! Kick ass. We just all have to realize that while you and Mo may have started near the same place, you didn't end there -- and that is all as it should be.                        </div>

                            So, Tony, did it help with elaboration?<br/><br/>I'm a casual rambler in these theory things, but I did try to explain how I was setting the stage for choice techniques.<br/><br/>I see Push as forcing limited choices to a drama point. Particularly as GM you have huge Push leverage.<br/><br/>I see Pull as offering diversity of choices, including inspiration outside the choices that are apparent.<br/><br/>I would much rather Pull a PC into a surprising situation than Push them into one. But based on how stories usually work, the world has more Push than Pull.<br/><br/>Those thoughts touch some of the original points I think Mo made in her blog.                        </div>

<p>Arref:  Yeah, I think I understand more.</p>
<p>This ... isn't what Mo's talking about with the same terms.  Or is it?</p>
<p>I think I, personally, would want a bit more clarity on things like "forcing" and "offering."  Like, if I say "Ah, but the only way your character can live is by pushing the red button," that doesn't actually force anyone to anything.  It just applies consequences.  I can still push the blue button, I just lose the character if I do.</p>
<p>I mean, if "forcing" and "offering" are shorthands for "structuring the consequences and reward schema so that certain sets of choices are more prominent," then we can certainly talk about the difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reward schemas where a small (and often shrinking) set of choices are rewarded far more highly than all other choices, and ...  </li>
<li>Reward schemas where a large (and often growing) set of choices are rewarded in ways that, if not identical, are at least equivalent under some reasonable notion of exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>... and I'd be cool with that.  That sounds like fertile ground.</p>

                            I think Push and Pull are pretty clear from the original posts that discuss them: Pull is opening up possibilities for the players to evoke action, Push is poking their characters with a stick to invoke reaction. Most classic examples of Bangs are pushy ("The Feds are hammering on the hotel room door!"), some are more Pullish ("when you check into your hotel room, you notice someone left a briefcase under the bed"). A good Kicker is probably more Pullish (although it's interesting to debate if the player is using Pull on the GM or on himself).<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at this right now from a classical, GM runs the world and players run characters in the world viewpoint. <br/>
<br/>
Actual Play Example from a superhero campaign I ran: I (GM) gave the characters "the Red Button". They learn that the Stormbringer-lookalike sword that the PC Blade had picked up was the demon of Judgement,and that a woman called Madison Slade (whom they are protecting) contains within her the Angel of Judgement. A demon explains to them that putting the two together will bring about The End of the World.<br/>
<br/>
And then one of the players (playing a character called Celine) picks this up and begins arguing that yep, they should bring about the end of the world, because this world is a sad vale of tears, and needs to be restarted as something better.<br/>
The other players don't agree, and the campaign goes on, with that loaded gun on the mantlepiece (that is, they know what the sword is, and they know where the woman lives - they come over to her place for cookouts).<br/>
<br/>
I say this is definitely pull; I put up a possibility, and Celine's player signals me that this interests him.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, they get bounced around time, and Celine learns that her parents weren't murdered by burgulars when she was a kid, they were satanist cultists that participated in a summoning ritual that went wrong. And Celine's attitude is more and more favorable towards the end of the world.<br/>
<br/>
That revelation is again, I think, a Pull sort of thing. I tell the player something about his character (in a totally cool scene involving time-travel, multiple intersecting character lifelines, a crossover with a previous campaign, a meeting with his character's childhood self, etc), and I leave it to him to pick up what to do with it (changing Celine's costume from Pink to Black, for example?)<br/>
<br/>
I say this is pull, because I've seen what happens when I try Push on my players. <br/>
Eventually, I begin to kick the campaign towards a "final showdown". Bad guys attack, old friends get hurt. The PCs, though, don't go looking for the Bad Guys. They find Madison, and get the angel within her to do the nasty with the demon in the Sword. They push the button and end the world.<br/>
<br/>
I should have known to be more careful with using Push on my players. There was the time (different, other campaign) when I had police investigators show up to question two PCs about a shootout in a Chinese restaurant; in response, they decided to fake their deaths and fly to Paris.<br/>
<br/>
(In Paris they look up an old lead, discover superpowers and a mcguffin, follow a hunch to Fiji, take a couple of playboy bunnies on a Yacht to R'lyeh, beat up Cthulhu, shift his throne to find the Pattern of Amber, and walk it.* But I think that's "No Myth", not Pull/Push).<br/>
<br/>
(* - No, we weren't 14, and the campaign kept on for more than a year after that).                        </div>

                            If you "pull" by offering but one option for the player to latch onto, that's really a Push, right? Does Pull require tossing out multiple hooks to the player so they have choices?                        </div>

<blockquote>Does Pull require tossing out multiple hooks to the player so they have choices?</blockquote>
I'd say if you Pull by offering two choices, you're probably still Pushing.<br/><br/>If you GM with, "gee, I'd really like the Player to make the next bit work and I'm willing to give high rewards if he can figure out the two ways this is gonna work. Say Player, why don't you set the next scene." Then I imagine a failed Push result rather than a failed Pull.<br/><br/>Pull really requires stepping back and letting the Player step in. In order to let a Player feel right doing this, they may require an immersive refresh of their PC's perspective.<br/><br/>Or so it often seems in my games.                        </div>

                            Good point, Larry. Push and Pull both suggest being yanked around somehow. Other ideas: Lure, Bribe, Offer. But I don't want to mire this in a semantic discussion. I need to go back, do my homework and read a bunch of posts, and decide if Pull means 'yank' or if Pull means 'offer' or something like that.                        </div>

Both Push and Pull are ways of throwing your fellow players off-balance, trying to make them DO things, but they're DIFFERENT.<br/>
<br/>
PUSH drives forward, forcing the opponnent to either resist you or let you have your way.  If they let you have your way, the push fails, because they didn't engage.<br/>
<br/>
PULL opens a vacuum and sucks them in; it offers a situation ripe with potential that they can't pass up.  If they ignore it, the pull fails, because they didn't engage.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I've ever seen Tony pull in a game, but then I've only seen him play a few times.  Tony, have you ever played a conflict in Capes, with no intention of bidding on either side?  I remember writing this up as a Capes strategy once (King Bystander) and it got a very negative reaction from you.  That would be a crude way of playing pull in Capes.                        </div>

<p>When playing with my friends?  Hell no.  I can get them to win a conflict against me just by fighting <em>a little less hard</em> than I normally do.  There's dynamic opposed forces there, and lessening one is more than enough to have an effect.  I don't have to shut down my opposition entirely ... sheesh!  Overkill.</p>
<p>Sometimes in demoes, though, I do go all the way 'round to actively giving people a shove toward their opportunities.  This is for people who haven't yet grasped their opportunities under the system, and so aren't providing their part of the dynamic balance.  An occasional sequence of mine, in demoes:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Beginner:  Uh ... okay.  So I control the conflict.  And I ... punch Major Victory in the head.<br/>
  Tony:  Does it hurt?  How bad does it hurt?<br/>
  Beginner:  Oh!  Well ... let me think ... I guess it hurts <strong>really bad</strong>!<br/>
  Tony:  How bad?  What happens?<br/>
  Beginner:  He's reeling in agony, and then just as he's about to recover his balance I <em>kick him in the balls!</em>  He drops to the ground, and he's whimpering and crying.  And it's all on live television.<br/>
  Tony:  Oh MAN!  I can't believe you did that!<br/>
  Beginner:  Heh heh heh.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note:  I have never, <em>ever</em> felt obliged to do this more than once.  My experience is that once the players have even one experience of doing that sort of stuff and not encountering any boundaries (save the ones that I explicitly make by trying to control the conflict) they <em>get it</em>.  After that, if they're not trying to beat Major Victory's face in I know that it's because they're not interested, not because they're holding back.  Most of the time, though, they brutalize the Major with gleeful abandon.</p>

                            Tony, I agree with Fred.  We're not dismissing you or your objections.  But when you're so used to doing things one way, it's hard to grasp a completely different way of operating.  In your play, in your interactions, there are no examples of pull.  Therefore, it's hard for you to see how it can be used.<br/>

                            This thread started off as an attempt to find some actual play examples of push and pull in action.  I think we've learnt that Tony's got some great examples of push in play, but that looking there for pull examples that help to clarify the general understanding of the concepts is probably not a good idea.  Not because there is no pull in Tony's play at all, but because there probably aren't the clear examples needed to help us understand.  For that we need actual play showing pull in as close to platonic form as possible (knowing what that is would help us, yes ;-) ).  So we've got some actual play that demonstrates push, it would be great to find some more actual play examples of pull, but that's easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody got some more?<br/>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>I don't think Fred meant that. I think he meant that when you have a particular point of view, it can be hard to see one that is an inverted POV. It's just life. It's like how I have a hard time understanding people that think that the presentation of an idea and the idea are completly seperate issues. <br/><br/>I mean, it isn't like he said: "I'm seriously considering the possibility that the reason I get it but other people don't is that the other people are wrong" or something as dismissive and invaldiating as that.<br/><br/>Though, at this point, I think Judd got some of his answer -- and he's said he's going to come back to it later. Perhaps its time to let this one die, and spin off threads to deal with specific issues without 100 some posts of bagage and unfortunate choices of words to hold onto?                        </div>

<p>Y'know, I'm glad I slept on this.  The break here is <em>so</em> obvious in the light of day.  I'm talking about ideas.  Your talking about <em>me</em>.  Why is that?</p>
<p>Here's a quote from the Wikipedia on <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_circumstantial" rel="nofollow">ad hominem circumstantial</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Ad hominem circumstantial involves pointing out that someone is in circumstances such that he is disposed to take a particular position. Essentially, circumstantial ad hominem constitutes an attack on the bias of a person. The reason that this is fallacious is that it simply does not make one's opponent's arguments, from a logical point of view, any less credible to point out that one's opponent is disposed to argue that way.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This particular variation is what I, personally, call the "If you understood" fallacy.  Someone else may well have a better name for it, and that would be cool.  The "If you understood" fallacy goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You support proposition P.  </li>
<li>Someone gives argument A for proposition not-P  </li>
<li>You observe that they have various motivations for arguing for not-P (the <em>ad hominem circumstantial</em>)  </li>
<li>Rather than say (or even think) "They're biased!" which has an emotional subtext, you think "They just don't understand," which is no more relevant but much more palatable  </li>
<li>Now, rather than engage argument A, you can propose argument B for the proposition "This person obviously doesn't understand proposition P, and therefore argument A is automatically without merit."</li>
<li>That doesn't refute (or even address) argument A, but it makes you feel better, and it opens the door to you explaining proposition P again, which is fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, y'know ... these last few posts have been a fun digression.  Now, if anyone wants to actually talk about the topic, that'd be cool too.  Or if not, then not.</p>

                            For the record, I think I'm finally beginning to understand push and pull.  These concepts are about social interactions, and about power.  They happen to apply to role-playing, because we're socially creating a shared narrative space, but it has more to do with the way that we make statements about who we are in the space and what other people have to do in order to work with us.  <i>The exact same game moment</i> can be a push or a pull, depending on who is doing it, to whom, the context of the game, their prior relationship, etc.  Push and pull can also appear in other social contexts, and now I want to go dive into social psychology to see if I can find some related concepts that might make understanding this easier.<br/><br/>Look, I don't want to be a jerk, but I kind of think someone has to say this: if you want a good example of push, watch Tony in this thread and the other push/pull thread.  He's staked out some territory in our shared idea-space and is refusing to be moved off it except on his terms.  There's no invitation to other people to help negotiate the terms of that space, and no acknowledgement that there might be some way to resolve things other than giving up or convincing him.  (Making it an even harder push, it seems clear that the only way Tony's going to change is mind is if, dammit, he's got no other choice.) <br/><br/>For the record, this is not an ad hominem attack.  I'm not saying, "Wow, Tony, you're a real dick."  Push is not necessarily a bad thing, and this thread has been a useful illustration of push/pull in social spaces beyond during actual play.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's made me grateful that my own gaming experiences have a lot more pull in theml - and it's also made me want to get the hell out and stay the hell out of this (and Tony's other) discussion.  In fact, the main reason I'm making this post is to speak for the large number of people who have been silenced by the push in this thread, and to point out that the same thing may be happening to them with push in actual play.<br/><br/>'Nuff said.

                            Hey Mo, Sorry about the delay:
<blockquote>I'm the dirty cuplrit. I will give it a stab in a fresh, clean thread in the next couple of days. Keep your cash, (though a sweet offer) - just make sure I don't get dogpiled when I post it.</blockquote>
OK, take your time.  What I'm thinking is something like this:<br/><br/>1) Briefly describe Push and Pull as a concept.<br/><br/>2) Describe Push in detail.<br/>3) Provide a "scripted example" (adding background if needed, whcih you probably will) of a few folks having an encounter at a gaming table where Push is involved.<br/>4) Provide a second scripted example.<br/><br/>5) describe Pull in detail.<br/>6) Provide a scripted example of Pull.<br/>7) Provide a second scripted example.<br/><br/>Is that cool? It might be a little work, like the equivalent of a 2-3 page "essay", but I think in the format above, if you can roll with 2 solid "scripted" actual play-like examples, then I think it will really cut all the confusion.<br/><br/>And yeah, my stance on the matter is to prevent dogpiling. There's a lot of confusion and guessing right now, hence the dogpiling, Socratic Method, etc.  Once you post, I'm gonna be all like, "Ok, folks, there it is, it's law. Feel free to ask follow up questions, but for now don't shake its foundations. Let it stand for a bit". <br/><br/>What I'm intending then is to see all the other sub-examples of push and pull in the above, or things that Feel like push and pull but aren't by your definition, get hammered out and discussed by others (and you if you want, but there's gonna be more fighty-discussion at the edges of the theory than you may be comfortable with) at that point.<br/><br/>Basically, what I'm setting up is a controlled environment to pace through all 4 iterations of the process outlined by Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
