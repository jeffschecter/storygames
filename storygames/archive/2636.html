That part failed for now, but in the course of this, I made a little diagram.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/Alignment_Diagram.png"/><br/><br/>It was very useful for me to break down the things that are normally associated with alignments into different categories. Goals are what the alignment "wants," tools are what they use to achieve it, and trappings are things that people associate with them (typically for good reason). I actually got to this by writing down dichotomies and assigning them to different areas, rather than brainstorming about "what does Good mean?"<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Are there things obviously missing? Could this be a useful tool in-game, or is it just an explanatory thing?<br/><br/><i>edit: This is not supposed to be "what are good, evil, law, and chaos in the real world", this is supposed to be based on fantasy stories.

Evil uses ignorance to achieve personal power? Chaos uses fear to achieve freedom? Also 'magical' and 'ordinary' don't sound like tools at all, mostly 'coz they're adjectives: 'magic' and 'ordinary things' might make a little more sense. But is there really no lawful magic in fantasy stories?<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside, it's fun to look at. I think using it to explain things would probably result in more trouble than its worth, but it might be useful for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60602/#Comment_60602" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T10:48:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 10:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be cool to keep track of changes to the chart in areas based on cultural mores.<br/><br/>It's certainly plausible that a culture may deem "ignorance" as a viable tool of law and this "Knowledge" would be Evil.<br/><br/>Then the players may find that their characters alignments may shift slightly in certain cultures.  hee hee!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60615/#Comment_60615" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T11:15:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 11:15AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE: Evil does use ignorance to achieve personal power - they keep <i>other people</i> ignorant. In Moorcock's books, people aligned with Chaos most definitely do scare the crap out of people in order to keep their own plans free of interference. ("<b>I</b> can do whatever I want. <b>You</b> can cower in the corner.") Law in the Eternal Champion series sometimes uses bizarre science that other people see as magic, but rarely actual magic.<br/><br/>As for the grammatical problem, it was a pain trying to keep everything using the same part of speech. I sometimes went for shorter words instead.<br/><br/>I just realized that this might show why lawful good and chaotic evil are often less (inherently) interesting to people than chaotic good and lawful evil - there's more inherent conflict in the latter two.<br/><br/>Eruditus, that's not a bad idea. The world I had in mind would be doing the reverse - tracking countries' allegiances based on their position on an chart of absolutes - but a relativist viewpoint would make "detect evil" spells much more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60711/#Comment_60711" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T18:59:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  6:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2007 7:00PM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I recall, traditional Chinese legal theory doesn't let the public know the exact contents of the law, on the theory that really good people will do the right thing without knowing it's legislated for them to do it, and bad people would just use their detailed knowledge of the law to find loopholes.

The tool I used to make the diagram was OmniGraffle, which is outstanding but somewhat too expensive.<br/><br/>The way I did this myself was to make a set of dichotomies. (Three-way and larger sets probably work too, dichotomies are just easier.) Where I felt that one of the two fit into a particular alignment, I then figured out where the other one would go.<br/><br/>One of my guidelines was that items weren't restricted from any particular side - after all, evil <i>can</i> use Truth. Items have to go where they are <i>essential</i> according to the views of whomever is making the diagram. For example, since I was using LotR for the good-evil axis, "ordinary" went under Good because you were protecting everything that was ordinary about the world, allowing it to continue by your sacrifice - and because the hobbits embodied the ordinary at the beginning.<br/><br/>The mechanical stuff was one of the hard parts for me so far. I'm always concerned about creating something that's too easy to min-max. I may go with something similar to the Secret Arts in WotG, where you can either act a certain way or take a penalty (or act a certain way to get a bonus).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60756/#Comment_60756" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T03:55:27+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  3:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2007 3:59AM by Joli.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is possibly the most useful tool for actually <i>using</i> D&amp;D alignment that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>That's all for now, must sleep.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>[Edit] The Tools bit IS tripping me up, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60757/#Comment_60757" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T04:10:11+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  4:10AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this approach, because I think it leads to stuff like this:<br/><br/>"Let's see: if I turn the fire giant we've captured and interrogated into a bunny using my polymorph spell so that my comrades don't kill him, that's magical and life-affirming, and I'm chaotic good, so give me some alignment points, please!"<br/><br/>I think you could even connect alignment more strongly to the reward system in D&amp;D. Here's something I've been thinking about: my attempt to marry Clinton's Keys with D&amp;D alignment--it's like Sweet20, but with alignment.\n<blockquote>Choose your alignment during character creation. Take xp whenever you do something that in your judgment fits the definition of your alignment\xe2\u20ac\u2122s norm. Additionally, you can take experience for adhering to the adjacent norms for your alignment, e.g., if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re lawful good, you take xp for obeying the norms of the judge and the benefactor as well as that of the crusader. If you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re neutral evil, take xp for the norms of destruction and domination as well as for that of the malefactor. Note: true neutrality is not considered adjacent to any other norm; its norm is a special case. Keep track of how many xp you take for any given norm.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the DM will be on the lookout for alignment violations. For any given alignment, an alignment violation is behavior that meets the definition of the antithetical norm, e.g., a lawful good character commits an alignment violation when she engages in an act of wanton violence or casual cruelty. For true neutrals, violations include behavior that suits any norm with no neutral component (i.e., lawful good, chaotic good, lawful evil, or chaotic evil behavior).<br/><br/>If the DM calls you on an alignment violation, you have a choice. You can either (a) take an experience point penalty (usually 1 xp), or (b) renounce your alignment. If you renounce your alignment, gain 5 xp and change your alignment to true neutral (or, in the case of the true neutral, to one of the neutral alignments adjacent to that of the norm you observed, e.g., if you violated your neutrality by committing an act of wanton destruction, change your alignment to either neutral evil or chaotic neutral).<br/><br/>If you think the DM is wrong, and that the action doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t actually violate your alignment, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s okay. Take the 1 xp penalty, but keep track of the loss. Later, you can have an atonement spell cast by a cleric (or cast it yourself), and we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll refer the issue to the group as a whole. You argue your defense, the DM argues the prosecution, and then the other players vote. If you win, you get the xp back. As long as nobody takes it personally, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be fun and interesting.<br/><br/>When you level up, your alignment may change as well. If you have taken more xp for one of the adjacent norms than you have for your alignment norm, change your alignment to match the new norm. \n<ul>\n<li>Norm of the Crusader (Lawful Good). Take 1 xp whenever you take action that addresses some clear evil or injustice in a way that has been deemed proper by authority or tradition. Take 2 xp if that action involves moderate risk or danger; take 5 xp if that action involves very great risk or danger.</li>\n<li>Norm of the Benefactor (Neutral Good). Take 1 xp whenever you do something that significantly and materially helps or benefits another person. If this action requires a moderate degree of sacrifice or exposure to danger on your part, take 2 xp. If it requires some very great sacrifice or risk, take 5 xp.</li>\n<li>Norm of Rebellion (Chaotic Good). Take 1 xp whenever you defy authority or tradition in order to help someone. Take 2 xp if that defiance exposes you to moderate sanctions; take 5 xp if it exposes you to severe sanctions. </li>\n<li>Norm of Judgment (Lawful Neutral). Take 1 xp whenever you enforce the dictates of an authority or tradition to which you subscribe. If this enforcement causes you some moderate inconvenience or trouble, take 2 xp. If it causes you very great trouble, take 5 xp.</li>\n<li>Norm of Moderation (True Neutral). Take 1 and only 1 xp for obeying any other \xe2\u20ac\u0153neutral\xe2\u20ac\x9d norm (i.e., lawful neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil), regardless of the level of risk or danger it involves.</li>\n<li>Norm of Freedom (Chaotic Neutral). Take 1 xp whenever you take an action that expresses your singular individuality in a way that flouts authority, tradition, convention, or common sense. Take 2 xp if such action is patently illegal or highly dangerous. Take 5 xp if such action is suicidal or self-destructive.</li>\n<li>Norm of Domination (Lawful Evil). Take 2 xp whenever you enforce the strictures and perquisites of some status hierarchy, whether by bullying subordinates or toadying up to superiors.</li>\n<li>Norm of the Malefactor (Neutral Evil). Take 2 xp whenever you engage in selfish, self-aggrandizing, or callous behavior at the expense of others.</li>\n<li>Norm of Destruction (Chaotic Evil). Take 2 xp whenever you engage in an act of wanton destruction or casual cruelty.</li>\n</ul></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60867/#Comment_60867" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T12:35:32+00:00" title="March 13, 2007 12:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be derailing for me to mention that alignment violation doesn't exist in D&amp;D anymore? 3e threw that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60876/#Comment_60876" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T13:21:16+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  1:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/><br/>Wow! That's great. I'm not sure if it's quite usable for a game yet, but your efforts delight me. I think tying it back to fantasy source material, as opposed to basing it off a questionable corpus of game texts or on one's real-world cracker-barrel philosophizing, is key.<br/><br/>Having dichotomies that span "Good-Chaos" and "Law-Evil" is novel, to my knowledge. I don't think you can really handle those dichotomies with D&amp;D's default alignment system.<br/><br/>Can we find some dichotomies that span "Good-Law" and "Chaos-Evil"? Their absence seems odd. (Or maybe that's actually how it is in the fiction?)<br/><br/>Hey, are you familiar with the alignment system in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay? It's clearly derivative of the D&amp;D one, except instead of all characters being described by a pair of terms, alignments are a single descriptor you get, from [Law|Good|Neutral|Evil|Chaos]. Each fantasy "race" comes with default alignment tag (Humans/Dwarfs/Halflings: Neutral. Wood Elves: Good.) and restricted alignments. It's a subtle difference, but I think moving away from a thing you could plot on a Cartesian X/Y graph to simply qualities you either do or don't possess is pretty cool, because now each alignment no longer has a single opposite, it can be opposed to any other alignment, like your setup describes. The guy that wants to be "Chaotic Good" may have to make a choice about which of those things is more important to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60882/#Comment_60882" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T13:48:30+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  1:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Larry: Thanks!

OK, whatever." But then as you stidu the chart and see all the little connecting lines, all these dichotomies pop out--"Others and self--Ok, that makes sense. . .oh hey, serenity and tension! That's really interesting! Oh, and here's technology and primitivism! Damn, that's hot!" and so on.<br/><br/>What really sizzles for me is that these dichotomy pairs are rife with conflict potential. It's an alignment model that encourages you to actually <i>do</i> something with it, above just letting it sit there as spell-weakness flags and deterministic training wheels for character concepts. All the inherent tensions between the various alignment concepts are laid bare in little eye-friendly colored boxes. Well, surely not <i>all</i> but undoubtedly a good representation. Awesome. This is actually the stuff that <i>stories</i> are made of.<br/><br/>Bravo.<br/><br/>And Bill, that EXP system has got me intrigued, as well.

I wrote those rules to prepare for a D&amp;D campaign that I'm going to get started this weekend, so I haven't actually employed them yet. We'll see how they work in play. I should mention that they are just a piece of the experience point system, which also allows players to take xp for adhering to character class "ways" (e.g., Way of the Warrior: Take 3 xp every time you win a fight) and individually defined character "traits" (e.g., Greedy, Self-Righteous, Brave, etc.), and for fulfilling social obligations (e.g. Battle-Sworn to the King, major obligation, 2 xp). I am not sure that the numbers are exactly right, but I'm not going to second-guess myself too much. I also do intend to connect this system to an action point-type mechanic, where anything that gives you xps also gives you action points (I call 'em hero points, but whatever).<br/><br/>As far as trying to establish a hierarchy of Evil behavior: <br/><br/>If you define "Good" behavior as altruistic or self-sacrifice, then clearly Evil behavior is selfish: utility maximization gone wild! Thus, I suppose you could give evil alignments more points for behavior that hurt, disadvantaged, or injured greater numbers of others for the benefit of the evil character. Sort of an inverse utilitarianism: the greatest ill for the greatest number. So for instance:<br/><br/>Lawful Evil: Take 1 action point every time you cause a single individual to be dominated, subjugated, or forced to conform to standards, principles, or laws they are inclined to disobey. Take 2 xp whenever you affect a small group (such as a family or a party of adventurers) similarly. Take 5 xp whenever you affect a large group (such as a community, nation, or race) similarly.<br/><br/>So the Lawful Evil character, out hunting orcs, gets 1 point for capturing a single orc and torturing him until the orc leads the way to his village. He gets 2 points when the family pays a ransom for his more-or-less safe return. And he gets 5 points for converting the village to the worship of Nerull.<br/><br/>How's that sound? (Again, I'm just spitballing).<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61870/#Comment_61870" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T17:55:08+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  5:55PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, interesting. I guess I'm kinda torn because I don't want playwers of evil-aligned characters to be <i>punished</i>, exactly, but if I encourage <i>too</i> much wanton misery and destruction, it'll possibly create too much friction with the non-evil characters. What I'm looking for is <i>just enough</i> friction. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, I find the <i>kind</i> of evil portrayed in a lot of D&amp;D games to be dead boring ("I kill people! 'Cause I'm evil! Whee!"), so I'm trying to aviod that, though this may be a lost cause. At least judging from the vibe I'm getting from the guy who's probably gonna play evil.<br/><br/>As far as the numbers go, the practical upshot of my interest is that I'd like a sysgtem where everyone's free to act out their particular character's "thing" without any particular course (or "norm") being particularly profitable or impoverished. So if the evil guys are getting double points for "normal" actions but don't get the extra self-sacrifice points, then that only balances out if the good guys are getting to self-sacrifice fairly often.<br/><br/>Hmm, what if I made it "1 for normal, 3 for moderate sacrifice, 5 for great sacrifice?" That way, evil is more profitable day to day, but good's prifit margins spike <i>above</i> evil when they act unselfishly.
