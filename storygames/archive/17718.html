He discusses how the games function as well as behind the scenes info of how the games came to be. Finally, we ask him the hard hitting questions like:<br/><br/>-What is your least favorite part of the body and why?<br/>-What kind of music do you use to get in the mood? (for game design)<br/>-What kind of media influenced your games?<br/><br/>All that and more in Mom's Basement Podcast.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
