There was this moment when my character was offered a chance to get his life's dream. But someone, not even someone terribly close to the character, was in danger. <br/><br/>I chose to save that person's life, simply because my character couldn't let him die. No way. <br/><br/>Now, in this game, the other players' responsibility is to create nasty, violent, sad threats and outcomes for my character. In this case, I gambled it all and barely achieved my intent in the scene--to save this poor guy. But I lost everything in the process! Not only my character's ultimate dream, but I got into a huge, dangerous mess, got attacked and probably captured by nasty mafia hoodlums, and, on top of it all, the guy whose life I saved, as a result of the mechanics, stopped trusting me after that, and wouldn't tell me the secrets I hoped to hear. Who knows, maybe he'll never trust me again (even if we survive the mafia attack).<br/><br/>Now the cool part is that all the other players were sitting there, cheering for my character, hoping he would make it. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are: I know I'm praying for their characters to succeed when they're up against adversity.) But the rules force them to throw nasty stuff at my character, or their own characters have no chance of succeeding when those moments come up. And the rules also prevent me from getting my way all the time--more often than not, they get my character into a big, fat mess like this one.<br/><br/>When those outcomes came up, it, well, it hurt. The part inside me that's still a little kid almost wanted to cry. But it was awesome, too, because it's just like that tension when a hero in a good book suffers, and you hope they'll win, and your heart and insides are being pulled this way and that, and you feel their pain, but you love it, and you just hope hope hope they'll win in the end.<br/><br/>I was telling a friend about this, because it's relevant to a design dilemma we've been discussing. And I found myself quoting Jesse's "Play Passionately" mini-essays. There's some great, great stuff there that really helped me express myself in that discussion.<br/><br/>So, this is sort of a little thank you to Jesse and Per and all you other folks that have been talking about this "play passionately" thing (even if you weren't using Jesse's term, of course). It's helped me understand a good deal more about where I find some of my satisfaction, fun, and release in story games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177111/#Comment_177111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T03:33:04+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  3:33AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, a thanks to you too for sharing those experiences!

As a result of this thread, I went and looked up Jesse's blog and read the articles there. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst one: I played in a game of Dogs in the Vineyard.. We managed about 5-6 towns if I remember right. I played a character inspired by the song (and hence presumably from the story) Lonesome Dove by Garth Brooks. Thaddius Jonah Gentry, a.k.a. Dove was born and raised in a non-faithful community when his mother married the sheriff she met while her family was going west to the territory where the faithful were setting up. He had the traits "Angel's Heart" and "Devil's Hand". I made him deliberately good at two things, talking and shooting. His developmental conflict was "Does Dove learn that there's a middle ground between words and bullets?" I failed, and hence gained the trait "There is no middle ground". He always tried to talk first. Never, ever did he go to physical non-fighting or fighting. If words failed, he went to guns, trying to shoot to wound. He'd never killed anyone in his life. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the part where I found myself questioning.. I wanted him to kill someone. It was something I wanted to happen more than anything. I wanted him to "fail". But I wasn't ever going to push for it. On the one hand, it's what Jesse was saying "why do you want your character to fail? Why is failure more interesting?" My answer is because I want to see what he'll do. I want to explore that situation with him. I didn't push for it though, because if I contrived it, then I wouldn't feel the shock of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this Playing Passionately, by Jesse's definition? I don't think so, no. It certainly is by my definition, but that's not what we're talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond one: It was in an old Star Wars D6 game. I was playing a member of a warrior culture who would not surrender her weapon. As such, she stayed aboard the ship while the rest of the characters went aboard the imperial cruiser for some meeting or other. That worked until a party of Storm Troopers came on board our little ship and demanded that she give up her weapon. She refused, and they shot her down, with stunning weapons, took her weapon, and imprisoned her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was furious. Me, the player. I was a little irritated at the GM, but I was absolutely in a rage at the Storm Troopers. When Kimber came to, she raged at the walls and door of her cell. When the imperial cruiser came under fire and the PCs evacuated, they forced an imperial officer at gunpoint to unlock her door. She killed him as soon as she came out, then immediately tried to find her weapon. Eventually cooler heads prevailed and I allowed her to be coaxed to abandon the weapon rather than die on the ship in the attempt. <br/>\n<br/>\nWas this playing passionately? I think maybe it was. There was something that happened beyond my control, and it touched me emotionally. In a negative way, obviously. Looking back, I'd say it was a good session, but like Jesse talks about in the article about fun, I'd hesitate to call it a fun session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177119/#Comment_177119" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T05:46:19+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  5:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Now the cool part is that all the other players were sitting there, cheering for my character, hoping he would make it.

You may have wanted to have your dog kill someone, but you never made it happen. You, in fact, pushed for it not happening. So, in a situation where it could happen, maybe both you and everyone else at the table wanted it to happen, but you fought for it not to happen while the others maybe fought for it to happen.

I narrated non-fatal shots (which doesn't matter a lot in how the fallout happens) I never put forth dice that required them to take the blow, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, <br/>\n<br/>\nDove shot people several times. Dove even sentenced someone to hang. What he'd never done is shot someone who then died of the wound. He'd never killed anyone by his own hand.

If I take the words playing passionately and look at how I'd define them, it totally is.

It's why when you say, I want to explore this about Dove, but I'm not going to make it happen, if it happens it happens, that's what makes me say, ahhhh... Nar*. It does not make me say ahhhhhh... Sim. If on the other hand you said his story arc should involve him killing someone and dealing with it so let's make it happen. That would sound simmy to me.<br/><br/>*Note, not saying that one action makes something Sim or Nar, more like I'm saying that it's an indicator of such to me. Also, who gives a shit about Sim or Nar? Were talking about playing passionately. I mean, look at what Jesse writes in that link I gave:<br/><br/>"In simplest terms when Protagonist meets Antagonist something within the game must be fighting for each side, either outcome must be within the realm of possibility and no one player should be able to guarantee an outcome either way. In the classic Player/GM setup, by default the Player is the advocate for his character and the GM is the advocate for any adversity that character encounters."<br/><br/>and:<br/><br/>"Indeed the player and GM may have very well colluded heavily to bring the fiction to this point. The player and GM may even be rooting for the same side."<br/><br/>That sounds to me exactly like what you wrote above (although Jesse is speaking in the general and you are speaking in the specific), which sounds to me like playing passionately. But, hey, in the end I can't really be the judge of whether or not you were playing passionately, only you can (or possibly someone else who was at that table with you).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177179/#Comment_177179" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T11:52:53+00:00" title="November  3, 2008 11:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, isn't killing someone in DitV more about the person on the receiving end?<br/><br/>I mean, you need to decide to escalate and pull your gun first. But it's your opponent who's deciding whether to Give or whether to take Fallout (and possibly die).<br/><br/>It sounds like it's really out of your hands--you make the decision to escalate, then the opposition (probably the GM, right?) and mechanics tell you whether you killed someone or not. <br/><br/>If that's also how you see it, then it sounds like you're playing your character full-on, and want to discover the repercussions of his actions.

I knew it was only a matter of time if people started wondering about whether or not they were "playing passionately."  First let me say that my blog is a highly personal thing.  The other day I used the term, "confrontational self-reflection" to describe it.<br/><br/>The key concepts in my whole play passionately thing is emotional honesty and social risk.  It's a sub-set of Story Now (Narrativism) and an application of "I Will Not Abandon You."  It by no means *defines* either of those things.  Just to be clear.<br/><br/>So that's the question I'd ask.  Were you emotionally honest with yourself about who you thought your character was and the situation he was in?  Did you play from those emotions?  You can, as an audience, want something specific.  You can even take steps to setup situations that push in that direction.  You can even play towards that end with the resources you have available.  That's why I'm not talking about Actor Stance.  But there comes a point where you have to just let go.  A point at which you throw the dice and your character and the situation is in free-fall and you have to roll with where you hit the ground.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177201/#Comment_177201" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T13:55:08+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  1:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's the thing.. I did sort of "make it happen" by telling the GM I was looking forward to it happening. I wanted to explore that. But I knew he would play honestly, and not simply make it happen just because, and that's what I wanted. I wanted it to happen, I knew when it did it would be his (or whoever else's) decision to let it happen. All I did was push my luck over and over, wondering if it would happen now.. Or maybe now? <br/>\n<br/>\n(for the record, it never did happen... Ended up with some issues and reorganized the play group before it did)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasons for wanting to do it wasn't to explore the theme of accidental killing, or mortality or anything high-brow like that. I wanted to know how Thaddeus would change as a result of such a thing. My intention here isn't really to discuss GNS, either though. But as I understand Sim play, what I want generally falls under that agenda. As Jesse says above, Playing Passionately is a subset of Nar.. So here's my question, at the end of all this. Does it HAVE to be a subset of Nar play? Or is it just usually? Because except for that, I can answer yes to your question. Yes, I was emotionally honest with myself about who Thaddeus was, and what his situation was. I did want, as audience, a specific thing. I made it clear to my fellow players that I wanted it.. But I didn't want control of when or how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in this, because it seems like my default playstyle. Sometimes I just want fluffy play, but I like to explore deep human issues a lot of the time (as part of my punching Nazi robots, of course). Only difference is, from all my reading and attempting to grok GNS, I only occasionally stray fully into the N side of things, usually staying safely in S near the border to N. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm even more interested because the human issues I've dealt with have been fairly vanilla throughout my play. I've almost never pushed the boundaries into areas I'm uncomfortable with, or where my fellow players were uncomfortable, at least on purpose. When we realized we were over a line, we usually backpedaled fast and drew the veil. I'm interested in the IWNAY concept, and this seems to strike pretty boldly into that territory. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for the record, if I'm not punching Nazi robots, I'm not really interested. I can occasionally enjoy just punching, but I pretty much never enjoy just the exploration of human situations and themes, at least not when I'm sitting at a table with some sort of mechanics in play. I want both. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, Andy or Jason, Iraq internet doesn't like Story Games, especially if I post more than a paragraph.

But here's the thing: GNS is not a solitary thing.  It's something that's realized by a group.  So what I'm seeing from you is:  You have a character.  The character is built from stuff that has meaning to you.  You let everyone know about this stuff.  Then you just "play" the character.<br/><br/>That alone is not enough to diagnose GNS.  You have to know how the other players relate to this "stuff" you've built your character around how you "just playing" interacts with the fictional contribution of the other players.  And where it all ended up in the long run.<br/><br/>So, I can tell you that from what you've said, I don't see anything particularly *incompatible* with what I've written about.  I just don't know if you'd be happy in my play environment without actually putting you in my play environment.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177206/#Comment_177206" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T14:28:44+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  2:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.
