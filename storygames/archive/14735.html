In a lot of their books they have a Player's section and a Marshal's (GM's) section, often with warnings that players should keep from reading the parts of the books intended only for GMs.  I have a friend who is also into the setting and would often play in my games.  I remember lending him one of the books once and specifically showing him where the Player's section stopped.<br/><br/>When I got the book back from him, he said he really liked it and then proceeded to talk about things in the section he wasn't supposed to read.  I asked about it and he shrugged and simply replied, "Oh, I just read the whole book."<br/><br/>As I see it, it's pretty much impossible to avoid players finding out a game product's spoilers.  If they want to know badly enough, they'll find out.  I think it's probable that those games that have the highest degree of success at keeping their secrets have separate books for GMs.<br/><br/>Now, that said, I've had players who can handle out of character knowledge before - there are plenty of players out there who can learn every single detail about a setting (maybe because they also GM it or would like to someday) and can play their characters as being completely clueless and enjoy it.  But then there are also those players out there who can never resist spoilers and can't keep a secret to save their lives.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, most game companies expect that sort of thing to be handled by GMs on a case-by-case basis, which is probably for the best, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335163/#Comment_335163" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T20:37:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:37PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dev,<br/><br/>If players know the secrets, does it ruin the game for just them, or does it ruin the game for everyone who plays it with them?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335164/#Comment_335164" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T20:54:44+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:54PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: Probably the latter.

Let users submit secrets to a website and then you can pull from the database at random during play.  Using AW as an example, you could have everyone enter a maelstrom description and then, during players' 3rd session, the MC would call up the site and get a random description of what the maelstrom <i>really </i>is.  It could be really dramatic if done properly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

They were always very careful to present all of their books from particular characters' perspectives and say that they were only revealing those characters' SPECULATIONS on the truth, which could be entirely wrong.  Heck, when they released their "end of the world" books they included several alternate "final truths" for GMs to use.<br/><br/>Granted, that helped give GMs a lot of elbow room as they were given specific permission to ignore whatever bits they wanted to (though sadly this was of little help to OCD-riddled continuity freaks like myself). I suspect, though, that the real reason for it had to do with the fact that in those days they were on the product treadmill, having to release a ridiculous amount of books per year to make sure they stayed afloat. They had a lot of different writers, not all of whom kept up on what was in all of the books. I'm guessing they used the "this is one character's perspective and not necessarily the REAL truth" angle to write off the various continuity errors that arose.  That's how Horus turned out to be both a faerie and a mummy at the same time and Rasputin ended up being a member of at least five different vampire clans. And a mage. And a werewolf. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
