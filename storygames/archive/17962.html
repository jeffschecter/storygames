The cost and time to maintain it privately is just too much. Time to move on to another Wiki. A migration... of sorts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a very, very, very long and technical discussion cut short, it's not as simple as cutting data out of the database and transferring it to a new location. It has to be done by hand.<br/><br/>If you go to The Codex above now, it appears to be down: I've cut off access to it. I<br/><br/> will reopen access to it tomorrow night (Thursday, Feb 14th) at 8:00PM EST [5:00PM PST 4:00AM GMT], for four hours. I'm going to be grabbing content from it, mostly the "Story Games advice/tips" sections (which are cool). There are other sections like sections on specific games and the like.<br/><br/>Basically, if you have used the wiki before or plan on using it again, I could use your help: Sometime within that four hour period, feel free to wander in, grab dumps of data (crawl it, manually "Save Page As", whatever), and store them somewhere... then later on feel free to repost it on the <b>*NEW Wiki site*</b>.<br/><br/>The New Wiki Site is here:<br/><a href="http://sgcodex.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sgcodex.wikidot.com/</a><br/>(the primary admin will be <a href="/forums/profile/Anemone">@Anemone</a> )<br/><br/>You can apply to be a content poster on it by clicking that big fat "JOIN" button at the top.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a kind of sloppy, unorganized move of only essential data, the data the folks care enough to move from one place to another. Personally, I don't often use the Wiki but I do find it helpful from time to time. But other folks used to check it out, particularly the game lists and the like. I'm hoping that folks who intend to find use of the wiki help with migrating the data.<br/><br/>Whatever is left on the Old Wiki after tomorrow night's offline will be erased. Unfortunately, it has to be nuked from orbit: It is no longer possible to pull the 20 Megabytes of good data apart from the 12 Gigabytes of crap data.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406177/#Comment_406177" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T18:48:06+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  6:48PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2013 6:50PM by Andy.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!
