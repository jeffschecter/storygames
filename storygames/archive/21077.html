Dramasystem + D&amp;D mashup. We'll be doing the full setup with desires and relationships and tokens from Dramasystem, the "physics layer" from D&amp;D. Threefold/GNS/RISS all predict it won't work.<br/><br/>In Dramasystem, you can have a scene with another PC over at the quiet rocks by the waterfall. In D&amp;D, you have to make it there alive.<br/><br/>In Dramasystem, you can make your character vulnerable and "play to lose", commit to the role. In D&amp;D that might get your character killed.<br/><br/>There are so many potential dysergies between the two setups.<br/><br/>To add a third constraint to that, I'm committing myself to a "canon" setting (al-Qadim) which I'm not used to; I've never done Star Wars, I've always done my own space opera. Same for other fantasy settings. I've dabbled with a little FR and even some aQ earlier, and of course Barovia when we did Curse of Strahd.<br/><br/>As I said, all signs point to it going pancakes. But. Maybe just maybe it can be awesome?! Interpersonal drama with some <em>real bullets</em> in that Chekhovian gun. And a setting I love -- the Corsair Council of Hawa, close to both Zakhara and Faer\xfbn. Pirate politics and the war against Qudra (or, for Qudra? Player allegiance might change).<br/><br/>The pitch I told my friend: \u201dYou're three days lost in the desert with not a single al-Badia in sight. It's night and it's cold AF. No camels, no tents, and you all have three exhaustion levels. Water sacks are still plenty, but there's only a single piece of bread left, and it's in the hands of your Unrequited Love. You have a fistful of drama tokens. What do you do?"<br/><br/>That scenario\u2026 uses the dangers of traveling in D&amp;D, mechanics for starvation and life&amp;death, it uses the relationship setup, it uses the setting, and it's a situation where the existance of the tokens is more a boon than a bane.<br/><br/>But, it's a pretty unlikely scenario, and unlike Dramasystem proper, there's no easy way to machinate such a scene (since I'll be obedient to D&amp;D's "physics"), and it's also pretty unlikely that the campaign would even survive such a scene with less than a TPK.<br/><br/>Also, what's even the CA? The "physics" are getting in the way of the drama, in "mirror story" terms I'm committed to DtD, so what am I even doing with this setup? And, there are so many competing goals: follow your desire and your DPs (for what?) vs going to the dungeon for xp (yes there are dungeons) vs striving for political influence and freedom from the warrior-slaves?<br/><br/>I'm like 20/80 on awesome vs pancakes. But\u2026 the reward if it works (however unlikely) can be awesome and the risk if it fails is\u2026 not so bad? We'll just play something else, or settle in in one of the contradicting modes.<br/><br/>Questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462352/#Comment_462352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T17:13:46+00:00" title="April 23, 2017  5:13PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the "physics" can create some real excitement too.

More like, this stuff has been in prepping stage for like, ever.<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer</i> + <i>Sorcerer&amp;Sword</i>: A "Dying Earth"-like setup, far-future Earth, heavily inspired by Gene Wolfe's <i>Book of the New Sun</i>, but with less christian metaphor.<br/><br/><i>Dungeon World</i> + <i>Dungeon Planet</i>: Still thinking how exactly the game's "universe" will be, but there will be inhabited planets in our solar system, pulp style. I'm going for a more serious vibe here, so not much gonzo like <i>Anomalous Subsurface Environment</i>. Heavily influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Clark Ashton Smith and Leigh Bracket, <i>Space 1889</i>, and <i>Carcosa</i> (especially the new AD&amp;D revamp that just came out which, surprisingly, I prefer to the older versions). <b>The pitch</b>: Veiled faces and long dark eyelashes staring from behind blood-red heavy drapes; marble and green jade colonnades under white moons; semi-tropical hot nights and drifting lotus fumes; scantly-clad sweaty bodies (no chain-mail bikinis, though); grotesque scary-ass sorcerers and necromancers; blood-curling rituals; summoned horrors from the dark between the stars; balls-to-the-wall Sword &amp; Sorcery (and Planets)!<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i>: I'm going for a 6 episode (or 5? can't remember the setup for PtA) season straight out of Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, and J. G. Ballard's <i>Crystal World</i>. Surrealistic, unsettling vibe.<br/><br/><i>Monster of the Week</i>: This is my system of choice for my cherished Victorian Age Gothic-Horror-Mystery adventures (think <i>Gothic Earth</i> for <i>Masque of the Red Death</i>). This one is in the back-burner for now, but I've been planning it for years.<br/><br/>Finally, <i>Monster Hearts</i>: this one will be short, a few sessions only. Older characters, around college age. Heavily influenced by Argento's <i>Suspiria</i> and to a lesser degree, <i>Inferno</i>. Probably set in a dancing school, like the movie.<br/><br/>Now, WHEN is the question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462432/#Comment_462432" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T10:12:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2017 10:12AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462433/#Comment_462433" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T10:59:17+00:00" title="April 25, 2017 10:59AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2017 11:02AM by Peter_Perry.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'll probably run this stuff on the internets, since I don't actually have a gaming group.

I am working on:<br/><br/><i>Kingmaker</i> a Pathfinder Adventure Path. 14 players, 2 GMs, all on the same map. It is glorious madness. We stick pretty close to the rules as written, but are allowing the story to diverge from the published books. We meet twice a month for 3 hours a sitting.<br/><br/><i>Strange Aeons</i> a Pathfinder AP. 4 players. Very much just the published material. We meet weekly for about 3 hours a sitting. Very atmospheric, very spooky.<br/><br/><i>Infinite Galaxies</i> One-shot. A monthly drop in night(that we call Drop'In Dice), probably will have three to five players, building the universe as we go.<br/><br/><i>Deadpuncher</i> One-shot intro game. Hopefully I'll get three different groups of three people to play the same game. I'd like to add it to the regular roster of games for the drop'in night.<br/><br/><i>Mutants and Masterminds 2e</i> A game of interconnected one-shot for the drop'in night. It will be a gladiatorial combat game with flashbacks between rounds of combat. Haven't ran a game yet but some character building has happened. <br/><br/><i>Frameless</i> This is my own modern speculative horror game. It loosely uses the Fate Accelerated system. The players inadvertantly built the world in a nightmarish dream sequence(the first game) with some fleshing out from me. The horror of that statement sums up the game well. It is almost all improv with lots of set dressing before hand. We meet monthly for between 5 and 6 hours a sitting. We are approaching our tenth game, it'll tie off the first arc and we will be switching to a new system that is more stat heavy.<br/><br/><br/>Listing everything like this is very satisfying. All the games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462487/#Comment_462487" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T13:40:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  1:40PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the past couple weeks, I've written a 72-page Player's Guide to Mirrorrim, the actual name of The City of Brass in my setting.

However, in Big Model terms, coherence isn't about Technique choice, so the Big Model doesn't necessarily predict failure here at all - there are ways to find creative unity despite variant Techniques being in play, so long as they are applied with a coherent goal in mind which is supported by the group. Of course, absent overt consensus or magical telepathic consensus, all those Techniques might lead people looking for a coherent CA astray, but that's not insurmountable.)<br/><br/>I'm prepping for <i>Monsterhearts</i>. My MC prep is pretty easy - I used my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">starter playset</a>, and have lots to go on. For prep, I list themes and important points of focus and then roll dice to generate pairs. This gives me various ideas. For instance, one of the characters is hooked on a drug he needs (or thinks he needs) to succeed in school. There's also a plot line about a father who is terminally ill and hospitalized. One of my rolls put those two together, so I prepped a "Bang" of sorts: the drug has been found to have medical potential, so it's being bought up by the hospitals, and therefore disappeared off the streets. They addicts may have to break into the hospital if they want some!<br/><br/>Mostly, though, my prep involves hacking and rehacking various moves and bits of the system. (Here's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21044/monsterhearts-descriptive-harm" rel="nofollow">an example I shared earlier</a>.) It's a little frantic, but I'm enjoying it. If I have enough time, I may end up rewriting all kinds of bits and pieces (like the way the Darkest Self works).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462566/#Comment_462566" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T08:34:45+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:34AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, in Big Model terms: it's a mix of TA but I'm leaving it open to see which CA it'll foster. If it'll foster one of them coherently, or if it'll be a festering ground for dysfunctional CA-clashes. Remember that in my opinion Ron understands the "Story Now" CA very well but has only vague misconceptions about any others that might exist; for example I don't think jhkim's CA from Skyrealms is present among the big three.<br/><br/>I'm deliberately focusing very hard on strictness of techniques here, but it's an unusual combination of techniques. Taking two techniques usually associated with Impro ("strong, internally and externally conflicted characters" + "mechanically rewarding 'play to lose'-behavior") without bringing over Impro itself. In accordance with my theory that each corner in RISS is about <i>one</i> core technique.<br/><br/>(James, the Big Model is a theory of RPG that has it's own wiki with terms defined. TA stands for Technical Agenda and CA stands for Creative Agenda.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462635/#Comment_462635" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T01:52:08+00:00" title="April 29, 2017  1:52AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Right, in Big Model terms: it's a mix of TA but I'm leaving it open to see which CA it'll foster. </blockquote>\nSmart.
