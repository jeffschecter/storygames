For those of you who haven't experienced it, Topic Wank is what round table discussions are really about: Waxing in detail about something, but not really saying anything at all.<br/><br/>Each member of the Mom's Basement crew picked a serious topic and a light subject to discuss and we rolled a d6 to determine the order of the conversation. You'll love some of the things we discussed or your money back.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/06/topic-wank-2-wank-harder.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/06/topic-wank-2-wank-harder.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381974/#Comment_381974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T21:10:23+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  9:10PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice podcast, I was wondering why you guys don't show up in iTunes though?

That's an inside joke for us (we had a mailbag thread and no one responded), but to be serious, I understand. The main idea for this style of the show is to discuss subjects that won't necessarily have a long segment, but to still be able to have that talk. Also, most of the topics are so far out of left field that they become entertaining from a shock value sort of thing. All of our other topics are usually design related such as our imagination episode, the use of jargon, .etc.<br/><br/>We don't usually talk about the latest craze for Indie games because time hasn't given it the credit it deserves. It'll almost be the equivalent of saying how great Britney Spears was during her prime years in the spotlight; annoying and superficial. Though, you do bring up an idea. I talk to the guys and we might do a year in review sort of thing. Highlights of games we saw this year that held promise.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Arpie">@Arpie</a>: Yes, this is a game where people select a topic and talk about it for 10 minutes before moving on to another topic. Truly, it's not a real game or a game in playtesting, but it does have game mechanics.

I think it's difficult to talk about best practices or give design suggestions without rooting them in the discussion of a specific game. I guess we could talk theory, but we are not theory dudes.<br/><br/>Rudy and I talk about our own design process a bit in <a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/04/episode-35-misery-tourism.html" rel="nofollow">Episode 35</a> when we're talking about our own games.

I'd like to see how some of these games you've promised to test work. I'm afraid I didn't care for the "man crush" jokes in 35 or the stuff-out-of-a-hat discussion in 44, but I suspect that's mostly because I thought the podcast was going to be about some average gamers struggling with game drafts and reacting to new rules they'd encountered. I thought that'd be pretty cool.<br/><br/>Also, how do you vote on that content poll?
