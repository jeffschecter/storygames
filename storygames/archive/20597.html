Not judging either way, just my (lazy) preference.<br/><br/>But...<br/>In meatier systems, it's easier to represent a challenge that is "bigger" than the player characters can handle. The numbers don't lie. A big dragon has a ton of HP and magic spells and actions per round and area effects, etc.<br/><br/>In games like "The Mountain Witch" or "Fiasco" or [insert game here] there's no ceiling to player generated content. Player characters can be as competent as they want to be. <b>They are never challenged except by what they allow to challenge them.</b><br/><br/>Are there any techniques out there for having that discussion mid-stream? Any advice for encouraging players to struggle against something they want to discard off-hand?<br/><br/>Apologies if this has been hit before, but I would also appreciate links to previous discussions if you have them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452080/#Comment_452080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-08T18:26:01+00:00" title="April  8, 2016  6:26PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2016 6:26PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For informal techniques, I've certainly been at plenty of tables which agreed up front that it would be good to not overcome everything instantly just because the rules won't stop you.  Beyond that, I've also played games which made character incompetence explicit, with Fiasco's emulation of incompetent-character fiction being a prime example.  Neither of these are the mid-stream discussion you're asking for, but they both enable it by providing a context in which it's easy and intuitive.<br/><br/>As for formal techniques, only two come to mind:\n<blockquote>1) <i>Swords Without Master</i> breaks play into different phases (roughly scene types), and one of them tells the player, "now that the GM has introduced the predicament, when you get passed the talking stick, describe how you Struggle or Succumb."  Succeeding, or even making meaningful progress (as I interpret the rule), is just not on the table, and the players know that at the beginning of the phase.  The characters ultimately do get to survive the encounter, of course, and perhaps even triumph over it, but not <i>at will</i>.  Someone has to decide "that's been a good amount of struggling and succumbing" first.<br/><br/>2) I'm using a technique in my unpublished game <i>Within My Clutches</i> right now which I think I can describe pretty quickly.  The player who's currently roleplaying their villain (it's a supervillain game) gets to prompt other players for types of GM-style contributions.  The types are provided in a short list, and while the first one is "what opportunities do I see to progress toward my Goal?", number two is, "what obstacles arise to impede me?"  Although some players request obstacles just so they can cavalierly overcome them, others use the combo of those two questions to encounter something insurmountable and then find another way to proceed.</blockquote>\nSorry, oblique approaches are all I've got!  Short of just saying, "hey, wouldn't it be fun/interesting/revealing/dramatic if your character simply couldn't handle this one?" I don't know of anything more on-point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452082/#Comment_452082" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-08T18:44:17+00:00" title="April  8, 2016  6:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One obvious thing to do is to insert the implications of a threat level at the level of stakes, whether in a stake-setting game (where they are discussed explicitly) or not (e.g. in AW, where a miss against a little girl might mean she runs away from you and you can't find her, but a miss against the finger of the psychic maelstrom which is invading your brain probably means something much more serious).<br/><br/>For instance, if a character wants to fight a fairly unintimidating opponent, the stakes of failure might be, "You beat him, but it's not a clean victory, and the onlookers are not impressed," whereas the stakes of failure against the champion might be instant decapitation at his hands, and then your body being dragged through the dust.<br/><br/>You could even go so far as saying that victory against a Balrog of Morgoth means sacrificing your life, but taking it down with you.<br/><br/>Another oblique approach:<br/><br/>Get the player's buy-in first. Let'say I'm the GM and you're a mighty warrior. First, I ask you, "Who's the opponent you're most frightened of? Why? What makes him impervious to your battle tactics? Why are you frightened of his weaponry?"<br/><br/>Now, when I introduce a confrontation with this opponent, it's going to feel pretty different. You won't be walking into it thinking, "Well, this will be a piece of cake."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452083/#Comment_452083" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-08T18:51:57+00:00" title="April  8, 2016  6:51PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2016 6:52PM by AsIf.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting question, I feel it goes beyond the game's content and into the genre and style emerging at the table.  It helps if the game assumes a degree of "author stance" because that's the level such a conversation would take place on.<br/><br/>Fiasco, of course, begins with the assumption that things are going to go horribly wrong, and end up badly for almost everyone.  It's a Dark Comedy.  In more "trad" games, there's the "videogame" type of play in which things just get harder, then harder still, then harder still etc, and the structure itself implies that at some point you'll be facing something so large you cannot handle it.  A good Call of Cthulhu game does this.  Of course in dramatic terms if the protags are going to eventually fail, what you're creating is a Tragedy.<br/><br/>I think what these two things have in common is a degree of ironic distance between the character stance and the actuality of play.  In Fiasco that irony is humorous, but it doesn't have to be; the important thing is to separate the experience of being a successful player from the feeling of failure that might otherwise engendered by the "failures" of characters.<br/><br/>Some people enjoy this sense of distance, but not all.  If it's appearing at the table you can often see it happening (perhaps most clearly in the "meta conversation" of the players).  Of course in a game with a high degree of immersion you don't want to break that immersion to ask them a question like that, which (I think) is what makes your question a tricky one.  <br/><br/>I think it depends on system and playstyle, and the answer might differ from night to night, even in the same group.  If while GMing I found that I wanted to answer such a question mid-game, I might take players aside individually (to prevent them from merely parroting each other or feeling pressured to concur), and ask them each a question to gauge them.  I'm thinking something like: "Tell me (Character Name), when you look ahead at the possible dangers facing you, how far are you willing to pursue this?  Would you keep going even if at some point you realize it's going to kill you?" - in other words, trying to make it a question about how the character <i>feels</i> about whatever "success" is.  My idea would be to read the <i>player's</i> degree of irony from their <i>character's</i> answer.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452093/#Comment_452093" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-09T03:41:30+00:00" title="April  9, 2016  3:41AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2016 3:43AM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. As many of you know by now, I'm working on a game about early C20 scientists out of their comfort zones and attempting to deal with problems caused by their having to deal with everyday life (and each other). Currently the only remotely tactical play is occasioned by the pushing forward of either a white or black dice, a la Fiasco. However, one thing that occurred to me recently is that some players, while down with the concept of player-generated content, might in the middle of an otherwise freeform scene have a hankering to roll for the outcome of some action or other, say if Freud and Einstein are coming out of a nightclub off their heads on cocaine and are trying to sneak past a passing policeman and not reveal their intoxicated state.<br/><br/>The normal way I cover this kind of thing is to have the players themselves, or the player group as a whole, decide what the outcome should be, and I imagine that given the sort of players the game will probably attract this will happen in almost all cases. BUT, what if a player were to say 'Can I/we roll for this?' How to react? The Old Testament in this matter is of course our old friend the GNS model, where you can't mix game styles, i.e. if the players are narrativist, you shouldn't have gameist elements, and vice versa. Is it now time for a New Testament whereby you can do this? I'm a bit nervous of floating this idea to playtest groups, because inconsistency is dangerous in this regard, but... I dunno. What do other folks think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452094/#Comment_452094" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-09T03:44:57+00:00" title="April  9, 2016  3:44AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rolling dice (or not) has very little (if anything) to do with Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>"Roll some dice for inspiration" is, in my opinion, always an option.

The princess has been very hot-headed and fought duels with impunity; will she fight in the duel with the local master of arms to keep her reputation, or escape? This is only a meaningful decision if there is significant risk of losing in the duel, but also a chance of winning. If, on the other hand, the players are competing over whose character gets to humiliate the master of arms, then setting the difficulty in such a way contains a conflict of interest and takes more finesse to handle in a functional way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452110/#Comment_452110" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-09T18:21:19+00:00" title="April  9, 2016  6:21PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some story games allow the player of a protagonist character to veto potential struggles for their character, just like Harlequin describes. However, this is not a really very common setup, except perhaps as a way some people play.<br/><br/>When considering your normal Forgite narrativist conflict-resolution story game, anything from Sorcerer to Apocalypse World, it is much more common for the final authority on the procedural question to rest on the GM: the character-player gets to choose what their character thinks and how they act, but the GM is the one who determines whether the described fiction constitutes a condition that triggers e.g. a conflict rules mechanic.<br/><br/>However, while it is not very common for games to give an individual player the absolute right to pick and choose their conflicts, it is relatively common to give guarantees. A very common strategy is to guarantee stakes: certain things cannot occur to your character unless you opt to participate in a conflict. This gives the character-player what amounts to a sort of a passive veto over the matter: refuse to engage a conflict, and you essentially prevent yourself from losing whatever things the game in question guarantees. Most games guarantee the lives of the player characters (that is, no matter what happens, the GM can't declare you dead or usually even injured without a formal conflict procedure, which they cannot run without your active participation), and many games in fact provide a blanket guarantee of "dramatic importance" via GMing principles that forbid undermining PC protagonism by having drama-important stakes resolve without their participation.<br/><br/>But then, what we actually find in play is that the passive-aggressive veto is not a very common thing to rely on, and it certainly isn't functional, so there is a considerable creative pressure on both the GM and the character-player to actually make the relationship work like human beings playing together: you offer me conflicts I consider legit, and I graciously concede to put my character at risk in them. So in reality the determination of what constitutes a worthy conflict to die over is a consensual negotiation. The details differ between games, and in my experience it is to the good if the game has a functional negotiating form in this regard, so that the players can play harder and the game benefits when the negotiations fail on occasion, rather than suffering for it.<br/><br/>All this is of course unrelated to the way the fiction of the game is described - Forgite games are most often formalistic at heart, distinguishing between the player and the character, so nothing prevents players in e.g. <i>The Mountain Witch</i> from rolling badly and losing a conflict while describing the process of it as effortless and inconsequential for the involved characters. This is one of the big strengths for the purpose these conflict resolution systems are made for, of course, but it does mean that a player character protagonist will actually only struggle and suffer in the fiction if the will to describe it is present at the table; if the participants do not want to show the player characters as weak, flawed and suffering, it is very possible for them to tone that down to the point of insignificance.<br/><br/>Which brings me to a vagueness of sorts in the original question: are we talking about ways that games convince players to <i>engage conflict mechanics</i>, or ways they convince players to <i>describe bad shit happening to their characters</i>? I think that these two things are traditionally pretty related, but in more progressive design they're often entirely independent of each other, so the answers differ as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452201/#Comment_452201" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-14T18:27:15+00:00" title="April 14, 2016  6:27PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting: my own interpretation of the OP was that the question, was, rather, something like...<br/><br/>How can we communicate that a certain challenge/opponent is harder/stronger/or even impossible, in a game which doesn't measure those things with numbers?<br/><br/>I'd love to hear from <a href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">@Harlequin</a> if we're anywhere near the focus of the topic he's looking for!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452204/#Comment_452204" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-14T19:46:25+00:00" title="April 14, 2016  7:46PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2016 12:12AM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's interesting: my own interpretation of the OP was that the question, was, rather, something like...<br/><br/>How can we communicate that a certain challenge/opponent is harder/stronger/or even impossible, in a game which doesn't measure those things with numbers?</blockquote>Aaah, <i>now</i> I understand the topic.

If it's just about creating what <i>feels</i> like a bigger challenge, the raise the stakes for that specific character or make the consequence of the actions affect several areas, like can the monster turn good while also not having the whole village burn to the ground?<br/><br/>When playtesting my own game <b>Matin\xe9</b>, where the characters can just try again in a different way until they succeed, I realized how much I relied on creating challenges around dice rolling. I learned a valuable lesson with my game, where I realized that I cannot, and shouldn't ever, challenge the players by letting the roll dice. Because that's not challenging to the <i>players</i>, just the characters. It's like rolling on horror tables to see the effect of a scary thing when playing horror games; that will only scare the characters, when the game master should try to scare the players.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough background. I started to think about this and found the following five challenges:<br/><br/><b>Resource Management</b><br/><i>"How can I use this in the most optimal way possible?"</i><br/>When to use the daily power. What value to maximize. Should I expose myself to get that bonus? How to spend the time or man power. What areas in the land is worth to focus on.<br/><br/><b>Exploring Challenge</b><br/><i>"How is this thing connected to the other?"</i><br/>Mysteries and intrigues. Gathering information, solving puzzles, avoiding traps. The players first explore to see how things are connected so they then can form and execute a plan.<br/><br/><b>Colliding Challenges</b><br/><i>"Which one should I choose?"</i><br/>Batman can plow through hordes of henchmen, but how is he challenged? Moral choices. A colliding challenge can also be about having different non-character agendas cross paths. Which path should the characters choose? Or if it's a two character agendas crossing, how can they come to an agreement? Or two agendas of one character, which one will prevail?<br/><br/><b>Describing Challenge</b><br/><i>"How can I reach my goal with these tools?"</i><br/>No matter what, the players can describe their way out of challenges, but the system should put restrictions on how to describe it. <b>Matin\xe9</b> was built around this. You had to include certain things in your description. Failing didn't mean the challenge failed but it added a consequence that the next person had to include in their description.<br/><br/><b>Acting Challenge</b><br/><i>How should I react?</i><br/>Put two personality traits against each other, or put the character in an unexpected or stressful situation and see how the player respond.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It seems like you're looking for colliding challenge mixed with what I wrote in the first paragraph?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452315/#Comment_452315" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T19:41:56+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  7:41PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 10:37PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>\u2014 scenes which lasted longer and conflicts which went through a larger number of steps will generally be remembered as mattering more, irrespective of stakes, as long as they weren't boring.</blockquote>\nYes, I can see that.

Mooks were more enjoyable, because they tended to do new things all the time, but went down after 1-2 strikes.<br/><br/>What I mean with this example is that either the system or the participants must add new things all the time to avoid a conflict being boring.<br/><br/>(This purely a longer "I agree" post. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452462/#Comment_452462" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T12:31:30+00:00" title="April 21, 2016 12:31PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>either the system or the participants must add new things all the time to avoid a conflict being boring.</blockquote>\nAgree completely.

In my experience, anyway.<br/>Thus: a general truth, according to my experience, is that it's easier to make a short encounter or conflict interesting than a longer one, and games geared toward shorter encounters/conflicts are generally more successful.<br/>Now, as I maintain that a longer real-time duration (relative to other encounters/conflicts in the same game) is a key factor in having an encounter/conflict remembered as a "boss fight"\u2026 in my experience, <i>planning for</i> a "boss fight" often doesn't work, as the risk of a boring, dragged encounter is very real.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
