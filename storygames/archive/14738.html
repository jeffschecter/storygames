We're playing a high fantasy campaign in High Valor (a hobbit treasurehunter and a winged, magic-corrupted outcast from society meet in a chance encounter in the woods and go find out what the evil wizard's deal is, in short) that's going pretty smoothly. And then, one thing led to another and I mentioned to her, while she was watching Nip/Tuck that there are probably roleplaying games out there that do soap operas. While that was mostly an off-handed comment made to get her more interested in the hobby, she responded with such enthusiasm that it now seems downright evil not to make good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter asking her what specifically she likes about soaps, this is what I got (warning- stream of consciousness!):<br/>\n<br/>\nDRAMA<br/>\nand true love<br/>\nand an evil twist<br/>\nand horses<br/>\nand some spanish countries<br/>\nand all the last kisses (when they think they will never see each other AGAIN)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, an absurdly overcomplicated plot powered by overflowing emotions, and beautiful people in beautiful environments. On top of that list of ingredients, it'd also be good if the game was low crunch and one-shot capable. Like keeping the entry barrier low and the rewards immediate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything like that out there?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335226/#Comment_335226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T13:54:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  1:54PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2011 1:56PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Smallville RPG does soap opera drama very well: all the characters are defined by how they feel about particular values (truth, love, justice, etc.) and especially by their relationships to other characters, so every conflict is basically saying what they want and who they care about.<br><br>Just drop out the superpower stuff (or don't, if you're going for one of those freaky-ass soaps with vampires and whatnot), and you're basically ready to go.<br><br>It's not <i>perfect</i> for a one-shot, but you can do a lot of the mechanical heavy lifting for her if you're willing to.

You can certainly drop that part if it makes you or the players uncomfortable, though I would keep the relationship escalation part, since it would make good material for the emotional flow of the soap operas. Hack it with a relationship map and keep the rest of the rules lite. When you play it, just throw whatever situation you like (you can even use the high fantasy setting you were already playing) and have players/ characters roll for reactions so they can keep adding/substracting points that take the relationships into different states and trigger different emotions.<br/>Oh, and whatever you do, keep describing the emotions in detail, whatever they are.<br/><br/>If you can fit that into a script for a soap opera, you'll got a beautiful experience.

Doing "soap" is the same as doing "colonial adventure": you can't actually capture the spirit of pulp adventure literature while simultaneously acknowledging its political outdatedness, as doing the concept "straight" requires believing (for the purposes of the exercise) in those values the deconstruction uses to criticize the phenomenon. Similarly doing soap opera with a game that acknowledges the genre as somehow separate from good drama is counterproductive: a soap opera from its own viewpoint is just good storytelling. This is why soap opera games tend to be ironic and comedic: it's difficult to say that you like something when that something is being defined as critically and misogynistically as soap opera is.<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i> totally does soap opera, and it does it with flair. The main reason for this is that the game does not try to be soap, it just allows you to do the sort of television drama you like. If what you like is soap operate in style, then that's what you get. This same reason is why it often does better anime than an anime-specific game, to pick yet another example where the label is actually counterproductive to capturing the genre creatively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335271/#Comment_335271" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T21:51:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  9:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say SOAP as well, I even own a copy, but if you were looking to play it more straight, you could easily formulate a soap opera game based on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.unseelie.org/rpg/wh/index.html" rel="nofollow">Wuthering Heights</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to think of it, FATE could be really cool for this, with its layer-upon-layer character generation system and Aspects.

It's not actually a super hero game. So, in this sense, it's perfect for soap operas. 90% of what Watchtower (the GM) is doing is driving wedges between the Lead characters.

Doing "soap" is the same as doing "colonial adventure": you can't actually capture the spirit of pulp adventure literature while simultaneously acknowledging its political outdatedness, as doing the concept "straight" requires believing (for the purposes of the exercise) in those values the deconstruction uses to criticize the phenomenon. Similarly doing soap opera with a game that acknowledges the genre as somehow separate from good drama is counterproductive: a soap opera from its own viewpoint is just good storytelling. This is why soap opera games tend to be ironic and comedic: it's difficult to say that you like something when that something is being defined as critically and misogynistically as soap opera is.</blockquote>\nAlthough I see the point, I think this goes a little too far. Certainly there's more than one middle ground that will work: <br/><br/>* A game/fiction that's serious, but the players aren't. In other words, we faithfully recreate the crazed stupidity of the source material, and the characters never wink or indulge in any irony, but we ourselves are yukking it up and being ironic and poking fun.<br/><br/>* A fiction that's mostly serious, but occasionally gives you a nudge. This actually is how many American soaps are these days. The characters will remark on the ridiculousness of the situation, sometimes plotlines will abort in a non-genre way, and so on.  In short, while it still has some of the traits that make it satisfying to fans, it also plays with the expectations not in any systematic way but just to spice things up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335455/#Comment_335455" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T00:33:02+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 12:33AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree w/ Rafu: <a href="http://dissolutegames.wordpress.com/its-complicated-a-game-about-messy-lives-and-messy-relationships/" rel="nofollow">It's Complicated</a> (can be found on IPR).
