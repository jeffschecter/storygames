                    I just finished making some serious edits to the <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/index.php/Verge_Reprogrammed" rel="nofollow">Verge rules</a> on the wiki. There's also an <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/download/VergeReprogrammed-2006-10-26.pdf" rel="nofollow">ugly PDF</a> I created by printing the web page to a PDF file. Some people like the PDFs, but it gets out-of-date and the wiki page always has my latest additions. You can always download PDF995 or something similar and create your own PDF of the web page. It prints fairly nicely (none of the navigation crap).<br/><br/>Verge is a post-cyberpunk game about identity and loss. Players interactively create a network of technology, ideas, organizations, characters and other people -- essentially a giant r-map of <i>stuff</i>, not just people -- and vote on which nodes and edges they like the most with a simple ! (awesome) and ? (questionable) notation that translates into dice. Each player has created a character and their two most important things, plus other traits and relationships, right on the network diagram that everyone shares. Play starts with a First Notice of Loss scene where a player picks one of those most important things to lose and the GM takes it away from them, and that kicker launches follow-up scenes. What sacrifices and compromises will you make to get back the thing that most dear to you? How will technology and future idealogy help or hinder you in your quest?<br/><br/>I'll be running a playtest of this revision at MACE if I can drum up 3-4 interested players. I'll bring easel-sized paper and colored markers and tokens and bricks of d6es. You just bring funky cyberpunk ideas, cool character motivations, and The Awesome.                </div>

                            First Notice of Loss is a great way to do the inciting event. Mind if I steal the concept?                        </div>

                            Steal away! The idea is basically: 
<ol>
<li>tell the GM what is the most important thing to your character, and the second most important<br/></li><li>tell the GM which you will lose<br/></li><li>the GM determines how you lost it and who took it and why<br/></li><li>the GM runs a scene for you based on that<br/></li><li>use all the regular conflict resolution rules except, no matter what, you can't win<br/></li><li>spend the rest of the game trying to get it back<br/></li><li>the GM gets to use your other important thing (and other character stuff) as leverage against you<br/></li></ol>
Edited to note: I particularly enjoy the dark cyberpunk irony of treating a game-defining character loss as an insurance claim.                        </div>
