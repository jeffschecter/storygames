Colin and Jesse will be here shortly, and I'm kind of giddy. So I post in anticipation.  <br/><br/>We all agreed to start up a game a local con two weekend ago. We made characters on Sunday during the con. The first session was last Tuesday.<br/><br/><b>What's the setting?</b><br/>SAVAGE BORN: A pulp, weird fantasy setting (imagine A Weird Tales cover from back in the day)<br/><br/>The Dreaming Empire conquered the vast forests to the north with the help of the demonic gods -- Death, Disease, Delirium, Despair and Destruction.<br/><br/>The conquered a race of pict-like humans summoned new gods to create a race of Orcs to battle the invaders. The picts were most conquered, and as they fell the Orcs rose up against them and battled both the picts and the Dreaming Empire for freedom. The Orcs have taken the gods of the creators and worship them as their own.<br/><br/>Two hundred years of war have passed and the Empire seems to be fading. The conquests of the Great Forests seem tenuous. Soldiers of the Dreaming Empire are torn between wanting to go home and wanting to do their duty and keep the dream of the Empire alive. <br/><br/><b>What's the system?</b><br/><i>Sorcerer (Sorcerer &amp; Sword)</i><br/><br/><b>What's going on?</b><br/>The game turns out to be centering on a Fortress ruled by the Empire at the edge of the Empire's influence in the Great Forest. It was originally ruled by the Golgondran (the Pictish-humans), then taken by the Orcs, and then taken in turn by Imperial troops stationed far from home. The soldiers are tasked with continuing to build a road through the great forests.<br/><br/>Colin is playing <i>Golgrek Troll Reaver</i>, Chief of an Orc clan. His Kicker was that he had a vision he should lead his clan to attack and re-claim the fortress lost years ago. The Kicker part is his Clan Shaman, Ruhu, says they should all avoid the Fortress and his vision is a trick.<br/><br/>Jesse is playing <i>Gaius Ambrosius, High Priest of the Goddess of Death</i>. His Kicker is that his apprentice was kidnapped by Ruhu.<br/><br/>In the first session last week, Golgrek leading his son ("You Are Me") close to the fortress felt a presence of some sort reaching out to him. When he listened he went backward in his perceptions through the history of his race: First the present day clan and tribe he lived with, then the battles with the Empire, then the time before he was born, and then all the orcs who had lived and died before him, feeling their pain in death and joys in triumph, then back before they won their freedom, living under the lash of their Golgondran makers, then just a few of them, then just two, and then the first orc and then... nothing... back to the point before the Golgondran made the orcs and Golgrek's kind existed at all.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gaius, upon hearing what happened to his apprentice, went rushing out to rescue her. He grabbed a sword off the apprentice's brother, who was wounded in the attack, planning on hunting down an orc and killing him and imbuing the sword with death magic to head off and rescue the apprentice on his own.<br/><br/>The closest Orc he spotted was Golgrek, and he rushed to chase Golgrek down. Golgrek fled through the shadows of the forest. But Gaius asked the Goddes of Death to part the shadows and reveal his enemy. She did. Gauis rushed to run down Golgrek down with his horse. Golgrek was knocked to the ground (and already worn from his exertions trying to contact the thing in the Fortress), and then grabbed Gaius' horse and drove it down to the ground. Gaius swing his sword fiercely. Golgrek grabbed a rock and used it to block the blow -- then took the rock and smashed it against Gauis' head. He knocked the priest out and ended up capturing him. He rejoined his son and other orcs and return to the clan camp with his prize.<br/><br/>There he discovered the apprentice already a prisoner. Golgrek announced his vision and Ruhu dismissed it, saying that their god ("Our God" -- a crude stone rock they took from the Gongondran three genrations ago) said they should not go to the fortress. Ruhu said he captured the apprentice to find out how to destroy the Imperials without going to the fortress. This is how "Our God" wants them to proceed.<br/><br/>Giaus tried to use his death touch on Ruhu, Ruhu (also rich in Lore) saw it coming, jumped back -- getting an acidic burn on his skin in the shape of a handprint... but still alive. Golgrek jumped to the apprentice, holding his axe's blade against her throat to stop Giaus from using any more of his sorcery...<br/><br/>And that's where we left it. <br/><br/>The whole thing very much as the feel of a Howard story where he alternates back and forth between protagonists, shifting point of view as they separate and come into conflict.<br/><br/>I have my Bangs. I know what different characters want. I have no idea how it will turn out!<br/><br/>We play again in 15 minutes...!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328722/#Comment_328722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T02:43:52+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  2:43AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please keep updating this.

(Honestly, I don't muck with the descriptors anymore. After looking them over a long time, I see that their job isn't to establish setting as much to establish a variety of points-of-view of the characters. And between <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>S&amp;Sword</i>, there's really enough to work with as is.)<br/><br/><b>HUMANITY</b><br/>Humanity is <i>Friendship and Loyalty</i>... which honestly hasn't come into play yet. Both Gaius and Golgrek are functioning very much in their roles in their respective society. But, <i>S&amp;Sword</i> plays a lighter game with Humanity in general.<br/><br/>I'm planning on ramping that up soon with some Bangs... but I'm also expecting my wonderful plays to start laying the groundwork for that as well.<br/><br/><b>DEMONS</b><br/>Demons are gods of the respective cultures:<br/><br/>The Golgondran had gods -- primitive, cruel and crude pagan things. The Golgondran (in secret ways) also created new gods so they could make the Orcs. They used the Orcs march south, raiding and conquering.<br/><br/>A man to the south contacted the God of Delirium for aid. Delirium said he would help, but only if the man would establish religious orders for his god-kin. The man agreed, and with the help of Delirium and his kin, a great empire was born. For the last thousand years the man who bound Delirium has been in a torpor, mumbling strange words that priests and witch write down and study as commands. In this way, the Dreaming Emperor rules the Dreaming Empire.<br/><br/>The Empire marched north, beat the snot out of the Golgondran. The Orcs rebelled against the Golgrondran masters. They killed the Golgondran priests and their Orc shamen took the Golgondran gods as their own from them, serving them and using them against the Golgondran and the soldiers of the Dreaming Empire.<br/><br/>The Golgondran are still around, and have a few of their old gods as well.<br/><br/>That's where things stand now...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328784/#Comment_328784" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T09:56:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  9:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>His Kicker was that he had a vision he should lead his clan to attack and re-claim the fortress lost years ago.

For a while now I've actually been questioning the real value of actually defining Humanity for Sorcerer play.  I think it's a relatively good idea for setup.  I'm very fond of starting with color: "I want to player Sorcerer game where characters are doing lots of X, people look like Y and Demons behave like Z".  From that I DISTILL a Humanity definition and present that as focus point, so that the starting elements are arranged more or less around that idea.<br/><br/>But in play I often find myself abandoning that definition very quickly.  I often just go with, "if you do something that makes me feel warm and fuzzy toward your character you get a gain roll and if you do something that bothers me you get a loss roll."  So watching you really stick to your guns about this definition of Friendship and Loyalty is fascinating because from my perspective there have been several Humanity check/gain worthy moments but at the same time I realize those moments have not been about Friendship and Loyalty.<br/><br/>But I further realize that for this material in particular sticking to that definition is really super important because from my perspective ALL of Ork culture, as we've presented it here, is one giant Humanity drain.  But then, that's why I chose the Price for my character that I did.  That's me "playing close to home".<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328804/#Comment_328804" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T10:41:53+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 10:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 11:04AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Per.<br/><br/>The original Kicker was: "I have a vision we should attack the fort."<br/><br/>I said, "That's not quite strong enough. He can have the vision, but there need to be something involving another person somehow."<br/><br/>And Colin said, "What if the Shaman, Ruhu, doesn't believe in the vision. Says it s trick."<br/><br/>So, the focus is off the Fortress now, and on the relationship between Golgrek, the clan Chieftain, and Ruhu, the clan shaman. It was strong enough for me because I knew there was tension a' brewing, and I had no idea how things would work out.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it still circled the fortress, where Giaus was based, so it seemed to be building some sort of localized focus of play, which is good for a <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword </i>game.<br/><br/>In straight up <i>Sorcerer</i> I usually go for something more emotionally grabby and more on the line in terms of a relationship. But this is Robert E. Howard/Tanith Lee/Clark Ashton Smith terriorty. So having enough to have people fighting over things, in my thinking, was enough. In these stories the emotional weight <i>grows</i> as the story continues and characters invest in each other. We'll see if it happens!<br/><br/>Also, I knew (knowing how I think) that this would open up all this narrative possibilities I had peer into: Why was the Shaman down on the idea of attacking the Fortress? What prompted the vision? Was there a threat that Golgrek could not see and what was it? Was the Shaman being told by his demon not to attack the Fortress? And if so, why? <br/><br/>So, all that would grist for the mill for my prep/brainstorming as I had to figure out and justify the Kicker. So, it was good for me at least, because the answers I found helped build all the world/demon stuff I posted above, as well as other stuff I haven't posted yet.<br/><br/>I can tell you that the other night, during play, the Shaman challenged Golgrek to knock it off with his talk of attacking the Fortress. Golgrek got all in his face with "Are we orcs or what?" The Shaman claims the voice of "Our God" as his authority. Golgrek wants to know who serves who? The Shaman pulls and axe and they go at it. Golgrek doesn't want to fight the Shaman, but it's clear the Shaman is actually attacking Golgrek to take the Clan Chieftain position -- which is to the death.<br/><br/>Golgrek is going to toss his axe at the Shaman's feet and try to find peace. But Golgrek's eldest son, You Are Me, out of love for his father, rushes the Shaman to try to save his dad. Golgrek is now drawn into the fight as he tries to save his son. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Giaus rushes across the clan's camp during the fight as all the orcs get caught up in the spectacle of their clan-strife, grabs his sword off the alter of Our God, where it has been placed, and rushes<i> into the fight</i> to protect a terrible blow from the Shaman striking You Are Me. <br/><br/>You Are Me doesn't relent his attack on the Shaman. The Shaman is going to order the clan to attack Golgrek. Golgrek goes first, ramming his thick fingers right down the Shaman's mouth, choking him and breaking his jaw. He lifts the shaman by the strange grip he has on him, carrying him to the stone that is Our God and batters the Shaman against the stone till he's a bloody pulp. <br/><br/>And more things happen after that.<br/><br/>And that was from the Kicker. And the repercussions are only just starting. And Golgrek is still haunted by the call he received by the <i>whatever</i> he heard from the Fortress. So I'd say the Kicker is paying off... <br/><br/>But does that sound good to you? And what were your original thoughts about the Kicker? I'd really love to know -- now you have the context of how play has proceeded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328816/#Comment_328816" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T10:59:16+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 10:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 11:03AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So watching you really stick to your guns about this definition of Friendship and Loyalty is fascinating because from my perspective there have been several Humanity check/gain worthy moments but at the same time I realize those moments have not been about Friendship and Loyalty.<br/><br/>But I further realize that for this material in particular sticking to that definition is really super important because from my perspective ALL of Ork culture, as we've presented it here, is one giant Humanity drain.

But they haven't hit the <i>bar</i> of Friendship or Loyalty. Hitting that bar is when we've moved into the moving moments of say, Howard's <i>Conan</i> stories, where we know something big is going on between the characters: hearts are altered, relationships are built or threatened. People suddenly realize, "Hey, I care about this person/thing/place."<br/><br/>I would say that, in the current definition of the game, when You Are Me charged into a ritual fight to protect his father, clearly breaking protocol, <i>that</i> would have been a Humanity gain roll. And notice what he got for his efforts! Banishment from the clan by his own father! His Humanity worthy action was not Orc worthy! <br/><br/>The game is, after all, called SAVAGE BORN and I'm thinking (but don't know!) that part of the thematic engine is, "Okay, you were born Savage... but now what?" We'll see!<br/><br/>Oh, and we should have made the Humanity roll when Golgrek bound Our God. We'll rewind and fix that when we kick off the third session. The key for me is that what Golgrek did -- murdering Ruhu, smashing Ruhu's body on the stone as a sacrifice after getting in the orc's face about his dreams was clearly about breaking Loyalty -- if not Friendship... I'll let Colin add more details about the possible Friendship between Golgrek and Ruhu if he wishes.<br/><br/>In other words, since the rules demand a Humanity roll for the Binding, we now make sure to put a spike in the action and make sure to define it as Humanity threatening with the fiction we create around the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328873/#Comment_328873" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T14:36:38+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  2:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>But does that sound good to you?

I guess my initial gut reaction to the Kicker was that is was somehow passive, merely by being a vision. I think you've described brilliantly how you first strengthened the Kicked and then how it worked in play.

And in some games it might even be more of a concern. But the thing about Player Authored Kickers is that the Player is saying, "I want a game about this." It's the Player's declaration about what he what to invest in and drive toward in one way or another. As long as I don't block it to the point of taking it off the table (as opposed to providing obstacles, which is a whole different thing since the Character is still pushing toward it), then I have ever reason to believe that even a vision is loaded with energy and drive.<br/><br/>Moreover, I'm blessed to be playing with Colin and Jesse who are well versed in <i>Sorcerer</i>. We've had lots of conversations about the game, and god knows Colin has listened to me talk about many aspects of the game, including the power and value of Kickers in terms of being Player Authored. So he <i>knows</i> it's on him to create a compelling cool Kicker that he really fucking cares about or intrigues him in some way... since he knows I'm counting on him to give me something I know he really can't wait to make a story about. And, of course, he did!<br/><br/>Jesse and Colin are energetic, creative players who just keep generating ideas and material. They're open about what they're interested in, and a lot of my job is just listening to what they want and feeding them obstacles and opportunities about what they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328878/#Comment_328878" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T14:58:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  2:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 2:58PM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Moreover, I'm blessed to be playing with Colin and Jesse who are well versed in<i>Sorcerer</i>.

I'd been reading Tanith Lee's<i> Night's Master </i>and some Clark Ashton Smith, which looped me back into some Conan stories I hadn't read yet. So I was hungry.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't figure out the setting or tone. And tone is really what you're looking for to pitch to the players for Sorcerer &amp; Sword. As the GM, you want to pitch the lightest setting you can to the Players, letting the focus of the social, creative act be set around the Players making their Characters<br/><br/>I wanted something like Howard's Hyborea... and even toyed with the idea of just saying, "Fuck it... we're playing in Hyborea. Conan is somewhere else." But it didn't want the onus of having someone else creating hanging over me. The I thought of using the setting for <i>Earthdawn</i> -- a setting I clearly love, but I found the rules too much. But the weird fantasy is there with the Horrors. And the Passions could be Demons using the Angel rules from <i>Sorcerer's Soul</i>. But, again, I found myself caught up in a big, detailed setting. And so much of <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> is in starting with the characters defining the situation and growing the setting form that. <br/><br/>Then, driving down to the convention I was struck with the notion of <i>orcs</i> -- savage and bold. They seemed to tap into the energy of sword and sorcery if we took them completely out of high fantasy and made them not pawns in someone else's story but the focus of the story. No Tolkien -- they would be creatures, weird creatures, made creatures. Weird fantasy incarnate. <br/><br/>I saw them in an vast woods like primitive Germany. So then I immediately thought of something like the Roman Empire invading those woods. And then I thought of troll vikings to the north.... and then I stopped myself. Because I probably already had too much! The setting should be kept simple. So stopped thinking and drew a map....<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/savage-born-map.jpg"/><br/><br/>I was drawing it at the table while Colin was setting up his <i>Apocalypse World</i> game and we were waiting for other players. He was like, "Hey... what's that?" And, well, he was mine after that.<br/><br/>Later, when many of the story gamers were hanging out I pitched the idea of playing a <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game some time during the convention to Jesse and he was in too.<br/><br/>But then, the next day I bumped into Colin and he explained that he and Jesse had decided that I was actually going to run a full on series of sessions for them. And said sure! <br/><br/>We made an appointment to make characters during lunch on Sunday... and we did!<br/><br/>I still think I gave too much information before we made characters. But Colin was all jazzed to play an orc and Jesse found his way into creating a priest of the empire stationed at the frontier, so it all worked out!<br/><br/>Characters tomorrow...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329243/#Comment_329243" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T11:03:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 11:03AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 12:46PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A note about Character Sheets: <br/><br/>I redesigned the sheets so that what is normally called "the back of the character sheet" is now front and center. I call it "the Character Grid," and consider it core to character creation.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/sorcerer-character-sheet.pdf"/><br/><br/>The bit with the Character Grid is that you place people, things and places that matter to the Character within the four quadrants of Lore, Past, Price, Kicker. You place things that are close to other quadrants on the borders of the quadrants, so that things that matter to three or four of the quadrants will group toward the center.<br/><br/>So, we gathered up on the Sunday of a local convention and made characters. <br/><br/>Of note, a lot of the setting material got made because of choices that Colin and Jesse made as they created their characters. My job, as GM, is to have a tone and feel I want for the setting, make that clear to the players, have them make characters, and then, utilizing the material on the Character Sheets, go work out more about the world, situations and settings at hand before play begins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329244/#Comment_329244" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T11:04:03+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 11:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 12:26PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin's Character:<br/><b>GOLGREK THE TROLL REAVER</b><br/>Orc Chieftain of the Beaten Last Clan<br/><br/>TELLTALE: Scarred Hand (from beating fists and forearms in adulation to the large rock that is his clan's god...)<br/><br/>STAMINA: 5*<br/>Savage Raised<br/><br/>WILL: 4<br/>Angry<br/><br/>LORE: 2<br/>Inhuman (Orc)<br/><br/>COVER: 2<br/>Orc Warlord Chieftain<br/><br/>PRICE: Inhuman<br/>-1 to first interactions<br/><br/>*Stamina is raised one point through a Humanity trade, via Inhuman Lore<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHARACTER GRID</span><br/><i>Lore Quadrant</i><br/>"Our God" (Clan's God)<br/><br/><i>Kicker Quadrant</i><br/>Fortress (the Fortress the Imperials now control, once ruled by the Orcs, and before them the Golgondran)<br/>The Imperial Road (the road the Imperials are building through the Great Forests)<br/>Centurion Arenus (commander of the Fortress)<br/><br/><i>Price Quadrant</i><br/>The Troll Reaver<br/><br/><i>Past Quadrant</i><br/>"You Are Me" (First born son)<br/><br/>Spreading across both <i>Past Quadrant</i> and <i>Price Quadrant</i> are:<br/>"Beaten Last" (Golgrek's Clan)<br/>"Deerp Root Tribe" (the tribe that the Beaten Last clan is a part of)<br/><br/>Right in the center of the Character Grid is:<br/>Shaman Ruhu (orc shaman of the Beaten Last Clan)<br/><br/>Starting Humanity of 2<br/>No Bound Demons at start<br/><br/>KICKER: "Ruhu says my vision to attack the Fortress is wrong."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329245/#Comment_329245" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T11:04:34+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 11:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 8:44PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse's Character:<br/><b>GIAUS ABROSIUS</b><br/>High Priest of the Goddess of Death of the Dreaming Empire<br/><br/>TELLTALE: Black Eyes<br/><br/>STAMINA: 2<br/>Natural Means<br/><br/>WILL: 4<br/>Lover (The Goddess of Death)<br/><br/>LORE: 4<br/>Adept<br/><br/>PAST: 4<br/>High Priest of Maravia<br/>Huntsman<br/><br/>PRICE: Culturally Arrogant<br/>-1 to non-Imperial cultural interactions<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHARACTER GRID</span><br/><i>Lore Quadrant</i><br/>"The Sarcophagus" (A shrine to Maravia built with wheels that Giaus travels with)<br/><br/><i>Kicker Quadrant</i><br/>Lucia (his acolyte and priestess in training);

These things happen, but there is no one to speak to Our God anymore. <br/><br/>Moreover, Golgrek is furious You Are Me stepped into a ritual battle, committing taboo. He strips You Are Me of his name, giving it to his second son, and banishes his first son from the clan until he can come back with a name he finds on his own. <br/><br/>Golgrek, grateful to Giaus, release Lucia, sending a group of orcs to escort them back to the Fortress. Giaus says he wants to stay. He is curious about Our God. Hoping to get closer to Giaus and learn more about the Gods his people are fighting, Giaus helps Golgrek bind Our God after sending the Goddess of Death along after Lucia to help guard her on the way back to the fortress. <br/><br/>Golgrek batters his forearms and hands against the stone that is Our God fiercely, tearing skin and bleeding. As Our God's Desire is Dominance, the sacrifice of Ruhu's bloody corpse, and the way it was delivered, adds a lot of dice to the roll! He binds the God. Everyone in the clan relaxes.<br/><br/>But Golgrek is troubled. He retreats to a cave and contemplates what it means to now be bound to Our God, as Our God tells him not to attack the Fortress.<br/><br/>Giaus, meanwhile, heads off into the wilds of the Great Forests, hoping to find the source of where Our God came from...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
