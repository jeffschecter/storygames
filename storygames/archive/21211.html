However, they have enough flexibility or other features that they can't be considered a traditional GMed RPG, and are relatively rules-light (less so than PbtA, perhaps, to give a reference)."<br/><br/>* Lots of my games! We should play some more together. This is kind of what I'm interested in exploring.<br/><br/>* I think <i>Primetime Adventures</i> is exactly what you're looking for.<br/><br/>* <i>The Pool</i>, also, but I don't know if you consider that to be a "complete" game (I'm not sure if I do, for instance).<br/><br/>It's a really fun design space, but tricky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464782/#Comment_464782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-13T19:18:31+00:00" title="July 13, 2017  7:18PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2017 7:54AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/>Basically, yes, what you said.

Players create all the moves during play.  GM determines what failure will mean, if it happens before any rolls.  Players are also responsible for a lot of world building, monsters, etc.  There's a GM but she doesn't role dice (except in one minor circumstance).  Take a look.

The only reason I included PbtA games is that sometimes the GM asked players questions that lead to world building; I've only played them a couple times.

(And on my list of games to try; we could play it together next time, if you're into it.) Kind of like <i>Kagematsu</i>: vaguely GM-like role, light mechanics, no prep.<br/><br/>On the subject of PbtA:<br/><br/>There's nothing about the concept of "PbtA" which specifically mandates more GM force or less GM force. <br/><br/>However, most PbtA games belong to a culture of play which has two features which most trad games do not share:<br/><br/>1. The culture of shared worldbuilding, disclaiming responsibility, and so forth. In "by the book" AW play, for example, the MC comes to the table not knowing what kind of setting it's going to be, what the themes will be like, and so forth - it's up to the players.<br/><br/>(However, it would be easy to play the game in a more "traditional" style without changing any of the rules; it's kind of a "culture of play" thing.)<br/><br/>2. The design of many of the rules and moves give PCs and players greater authority over outcomes than in typical 'trad games', which creates a very different dynamic over the long term.<br/><br/>For instance, NPCs not having stats or difficulty numbers means that no one is "invincible"; the PCs can pretty much seduce, manipulate, or kill anyone they want.<br/><br/>Further, many moves build in aspects of play which push against a lot of "traditional" GM practices (e.g. the ability to convert people into "allies" in AW with advanced moves, moves which allow you to declare really major aspects of the setting and its denizens, and so forth). A great example is the "start of session" moves, which allow players (effectively) to declare what's going wrong in the city where they live, who's deserting their gang, or what is true about the past of the setting (e.g. the Quarantine's start of session move).<br/><br/>Many of the "tricks of the trade" strongly associated with "traditional GMing" aren't really possible in AW without breaking rules (for instance, stuff like asking the player to repeatedly make Climbing checks until they fail, fudging die rolls, assigning a bad guy so many hit points they can't be overcome until later in the game, assigning difficulty levels/target numbers to fictional obstacles which we don't want the PCs to be able to overcome, or influencing the direction of play by handing out XP rewards for specific actions the GM wants the players to take).<br/><br/><i>(A parenthetical for Sandra: generally speaking, discussions like to draw a distinction between "trad play" - which typically involves a pre-plotted scenario and lots of "Rule Zero" use by the GM in order to "let the players play in the GM's story" - and "old-school play", where the GM acts as an impartial referee and players attempt to face challenges in a consistent fictional environment like a dungeon. Those are quite different styles of play!)</i><br/><br/><br/>ETA: A perfect example might be the "adventure hook" construction of many, many traditional adventures:<br/><br/>They involve the characters being assigned a "mission" by a reputable and trusted NPC... later, the PCs discover that the NPC lied to them, and they were in fact betrayed!<br/><br/>This works great with most traditional systems (assuming you're into that kind of adventure, anyway...), where the PCs are all adventure types forming a group looking for treasure or experience.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see how that kind of plot would fail immediately in a game of AW - first of all, the playbook choices would immediately disqualify many/most of the characters from being interested in the "plot hook" in the first. They have other priorities and other interests, chosen by the players - the idea of chasing a "plot hook" isn't even on the radar here. Further, those who <i>would</i> decide to interact with the NPC could easily manipulate or read the NPC and discover the deception immediately.

One thing that I don't like is that PbtA games have specific outcome lists. If they're just suggestions that's fine, but I think it be more interesting if you could improv a complication (i.e. Roll from 7-9). Paul, Iactually wanted to ask you, can you improv the results of a move or are you supposed to stick to the lists. I don't know if you remember my half RPG half Story game based inspired by Fate and PbtA, but in that game I didn't have lists the outcomes of moves, I had the GM improv the results. It kind of sucks that BitD pretty much incorporated Fate in a very similar way to how I did in my design. Anyway, are the move outcome lists just suggestions?  I never read a complete PbtA game and there's a lot that I don't know still. Thanks :-)<br/><br/>Also Paul, do you think any important/worthwhile PbtA games are missing from this list that I should pick up?<br/><br/>Apocalypse World <br/>Dungeon World<br/>Monsterhearts<br/>Sagas of the Icelanders<br/>The Sprawl <br/>The Veil <br/>Blades in the Dark<br/>Cartel<br/>Masks <br/>Undying<br/>Epyllion<br/>Urban Shadows<br/>Fellowship <br/>The Warren<br/>Night Witches<br/>Bluebeard's Bride<br/>City of Mist<br/>The Watch<br/>Black Stars Rise<br/>World Wide Wrestling <br/>Capes<br/>Tremulus <br/>Monster of the Week<br/>Firebrands<br/>Dream Askew <br/>Action Movie World<br/>The Sundered Land<br/>AW: Fallen Empires <br/>Uncharted Worlds<br/>The Sword, the Crown, and The Unspeakable Power<br/>World of Dungeons <br/>Edit:<br/>Ghost Lines<br/><br/>(I also plan on picking up Noir World when it comes out).

The GM/MC and player can totally interpret in an improvisational way, and there is inherent negotiation in this as well. <br/><br/>Let me say what I love about the lists. Rather than having a binary outcome from rolls, the player can choose how they want their player actions to go after you know whether its a hit, partial hit, or miss. Versus trad play where the roll outcome is completely GM interpretation. The lists outline a set of stakes that keep the action feeling grounded, but they should always take their cue from the established fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464841/#Comment_464841" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T05:40:34+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  5:40AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I am surprised you didn't mention Ghost Lines.
