Paizo would have been a great company to have had on-board at launch, providing extra adventures during the early months.<br/><br/>I'm very curious to see what Paizo's customer numbers will look like post 4E, mind. But then, I guess the route they've taken ensures they can put 3.75 product out until next year, and then they can always start putting out 4E stuff if that would mean a bigger market for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135937/#Comment_135937" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-22T08:54:27+00:00" title="March 22, 2008  8:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Paizo as a company but I am very biased. They were probably prepared for this path (the 3.75 PDF must have taken at least 2 months to put together) but ultimately I don't think they had much of a choice. Wizards still hasn't released their GSL license and 4E materials. If Paizo kept waiting, it would stall their product line and seeing how so much of their products are subscription based, that wasn't an option. They could have pushed forward, business as usual but the fact that they are going the extra mile and releasing 3.75 as a free document and an open playtest is pretty awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is quite a bit I like about 4E. But I don't think 4E will support the type of play Paizo's audience expects and the type of scenarios their modules support. From the reaction I've read online and the people I've spoken to offline, Paizo is garnering quite a bit of support. And a lot of the negative reaction is coming from people who aren't their customers to begin with. My guess is that this will be very much financially lucrative for them up to the 4E launch all the way to November 08. Past that I have no idea how things will swing. The fact that they hired Nick Logue to run their organized play efforts only solidifies my faith in their approach. There quite a few RPGA members that are pissed at wizards hitting the reset button.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan, if you playtest 3.75 or have any suggestions, let me know and I'll submit them directly to Nick.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135938/#Comment_135938" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-22T09:01:24+00:00" title="March 22, 2008  9:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2008 9:01AM by Ry.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's so easy for me to get sucked into d20-based design (to the exclusion of all else) that I had to make a vow to spend 2008 without touching it so I'd actually play and see other games.

Considering this and Green Ronin releasing an updated True20 at first I thought this wasn't a good thing.  I thought that there would be a whole group of people that would just continuing playing 3.5 and just use the products produced by Paizo (very high quality materials, mind you) and never be willing to see the very cool stuff I have seen out of 4th Ed.  I kinda think this is <b>sort of </b>like Microsoft working with SEGA on the Dreamcast then when they learned all they needed to they turned around and developed the X-Box.  Although Wizards created this own beast by creating the OGL in the first place it's a little odd to have a economic basis built on the back of another company and perpetuated by people unwilling to purchase new product.<br/><br/>BUT then my free market sentimentalities kicked in and I realized that it was a good thing deflating Wizard's marketshare a little and having more choices so I am completely behind Paizo's decision.  In fact I was cursing them and Green Ronin only because I know I will basically be buying 4e and True20 AND Pathfinder stuff.  *sigh*  *Don siddles up to the bar*<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136340/#Comment_136340" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T14:17:56+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  2:17PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2008 2:18PM by Caesar Slaad.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><br/>I'm with Ryan.</blockquote>\nI'm not.<br/><br/>If they were a no-holds-barred mod that wasn't concerned with compatibility, removing SR would work.

Which is an annoying process. Copyright, which is easy, only protects the words that express the mechanics. Not the mechanics themselves. Paizo could have mechanics similar to 4E but if they ever got into trouble, they should be prepared to prove that their rules are not derivative work. But it is likely that most of the rules in 4E are derivative themselves. It's tricky.

But speaking generally, if that were true, I don't think that some of the changes we see in 4e would be necessary. One particular example I see is that of resource management centered games. The idea of moving towards more per-encounter abilities for all classes and giving everybody healing surges means that resource management will be a far less central factor under 4e.<br/><br/>You can't just go about an edition saying "big changes need to be made" and then say there is no change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136697/#Comment_136697" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T13:37:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  1:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 1:39PM by jenskot.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But I don't think 4E will support the type of play Paizo's audience expects and the type of scenarios their modules support.</blockquote>\nI've heard other people say this (Paizo included) but I don't get it. How are the rule changes in 4e going to prevent Paizo from writing the same adventures they always have? 4e does all the same D&amp;D stuff that 3.5 did.<br/><br/>Mostly based on hearsay (which can all turn out to be false once 4E is released), the following factors likely affected Paizo's decision:<br/><br/>- No backwards compatibility.<br/>- A huge portion of their audience has spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on 3.5 supplements, they will likely be slow to upgrade.<br/>- I know at least in NY, many RPGA members feel frustrated that Wizards hit the reset button. Given that many of them subscribe to Pathfinder and that Paizo is launching some sort of organized play effort, there is likely a lot of money in appealing to this segment of their audience.<br/>- I'm curious what official 4E modules will look like but given what I've heard about the rules, a module would need to visually detail every single room referenced since using a battle map is now 100% required.<br/>- Paizo loves fully fleshed out NPCs. NPCs in 4E are now threats and more modular (which I like) but also more generic. I've also heard mixed information regarding how customizable NPCs are. <br/>- Power levels are completely different. Players are much, much harder to kill. Resource management is completely different.<br/>- Paizo also loves fluff and color. Mechanically, most of the powers and spells I've seen in 4E are now all 100% combat based. Seemingly, anything with interactivity that can not be replicated via their virtual online environment have been removed. Although I've heard mixed things here. Not sure how true this is yet.<br/><br/>But most important of all, as I mentioned above, most of this is hearsay. And it is also hearsay from Paizo's perspective as well. They have no real idea what 4E will look like. Wizards hasn't released their licensing information yet nor revealed what the rules look like to their third party partners. It will likely take months for Paizo to adapt to the 4E rules let alone support it with quality material. Many of their sales are subscription based. They can't just stop production and hope Wizards will help them out. <br/><br/>That all being said, although I think 4E will be a very different game, and not what I necessarily want from D&amp;D, I am excited about what I have read and do plan on buying and playing it. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137213/#Comment_137213" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T13:11:31+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  1:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rumors are running around that Wizards may consider killing the GSL now that they hired Greg Leeds, who came over from Hasbro International Marketing.

I think it's going to be a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to the finished product. I think the lead designer, Jason Bulmahn, and the whole Paizo crew are doing an amazing job.<br/><br/>My role is "rules consultant," and I'll be really up-front with you regarding what that means (and doesn't mean). The way it's been working for the last couple of weeks is, Jason emails me with the occasional question or bounces an idea off of me, and I tell him what I think. I also review the new material he comes up with and give my 2 cents. And that's really about it. Jason's not under any obligation to take any advice I might give. It's his baby. He makes the final decisions. I'm not a designer on this project, I'm a resource. Don't, for example, expect to see a ton of stuff from the Book of Experimental Might books showing up in Pathfinder (although there might be a little). Pathfinder and the BoXM books have very different goals. Also, because that's the way my role works, don't come to me with your own ideas or feedback regarding Pathfinder--I'm not going to be able to do anything with them. The Paizo folks, however, are eager to get any and all feedback that people provide, which I think is supremely cool and part of the reason I'm glad to be a part of this.<br/><br/>Part of me wishes I could be involved more deeply, but to be very honest, I just don't have the time with the other (non-P&amp;P game related) projects I have going on. I feel fortunate and honored that they value my opinions enough to let me be involved at all.<br/><br/>Jason and Erik have so far been great to work with. Jason and I met for an afternoon a couple of weeks ago and discussed a lot of the stuff that ended up in Alpha Release 2.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143942/#Comment_143942" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:51:07+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also point out that there are people who really enjoy 3.5.
