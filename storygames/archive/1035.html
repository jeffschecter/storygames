                    I just got back from the library where I ran a sort of game for eight older teens from the local juvenile lock-up and their adult handlers.  It was a very simple dice game.  The topic was cryptozoology, so I gave a five minute speech, divided them into teams (they named themselves THE HOT BOYS and THE WILD GRRLS) and explained the rules.  They would go around the world trying to discover weird beasts.  They could stick together or split up, and to discover a critter, they needed to roll the number of team members in that location or less on 1d6.  A roll of 6 meant the monster was debunked with no points scored.  <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~mornings/crypto/" rel="nofollow">I had a funny map with exciting illustrations</a>.  Some observations:<br/><br/>1.  Both teams decided that sticking together for a 66% success was better than reducing the odds but getting more die rolls.  One team had a guy who went off by himself on a whim a few times, and whenever he did, his 3 team-mates in Amazonia or wherever invariably rolled a four.  <br/><br/>2.  Everybody got into it - including the handlers* - arguing about where to go next - "Mongolia!"  "No, Puerto Rico!" - as though it really mattered.  The discovery aspect was fun.  They'd groan when their designated roller rolled a six.<br/><br/>3.  Skeptics!  None of them would entertain the notion that any of those beasts could exist.  They even looked askance at the thylacine.  It warmed my heart.<br/><br/>4.  Their focus and intensity was palpable.  Next time I'm totally doing a roleplaying thing.  <br/><br/>It was super fun.<br/><br/>*One of them ended an argument by saying "that's where we go, or we're going home."                </div>

                            This sounds pretty cool! I'm wondering about how you ended up doing this gig and whether it'll be an ongoing thing. Is there a full-on ruleset/AP post somewhere?                        </div>

                            That's the whole rules, Dave.  It wasn't a very elaborate game, primarily because I was expecting much younger participants based on past events.  They were so sweet and funny (once I won them over with chips and soda) that I'm thinking about rounding up some co-conspirators and offering to do more board game oriented events either at the library or at their facility.  I got roped into presenting a program by my wife, who is the young adult librarian for the county.  Every summer there is a big push to get teens into the library and every summer she writes me in for one week - last year we did "Dungeons and Dragons night", which was a crazy, fun, disaster.                        </div>
