But anyway, here's a few examples of how it's been used:<br/><br/>The Gunlugger who lived with the Maestro D's hired gang, and was pretty much provided for by their commune, got her hands on a bag of batteries (1-barter) after performing a special mission (from said Maestro) herself, compared to the day-to-day "protect and keep order in the Snake Pit" the whole gang was about. She then happened into some trouble, got away, and had an idea: instead of going home to the gang base, she took a stolen bike and went clear across to a neighbouring hold, and just waved the batteries in the guard's face. "Shelter and security for 1 night, no questions". This was, by the list of "1-barter is the going rate for..." even overpriced, so they just let her in.<br/><br/>The Maestro D' got himself some gigs and moonlighting, and then suceeded at doing murders for 3-barter. This transaction was depicted as a wealthy merchant giving him a major payment, so much so that the merchant got referred to next session as "right, he's a bit down on cash right now".<br/><br/>The Gunlugger got sent to find a guy and bring him to the Maestro "with any means necessary", which previously has meant ask once and then beat him up. The guy bribed him with, after being pushed, 2-barter which sent the Gunlugger of happy, going over what to say in her head \u2013 "no boss, I didn't find him anywhere!"<br/><br/>I expect that we pretty soon will be asked to pay up 1-barter each to cover our living expenses for the last month, but so far only a week has passed in-game. And anyway this sum fades in comparisons to the sums that get thrown around as bribes and fees. We pretty much assume a standard of living \u2013 all PCs so far have somewhere to live and thus doesn't have big trouble with finding food, though as I said we may be expected to pay for it soon. Anyway, stuff that basic is kept off-screen.<br/><br/>In my experience barter is a bargaining chip; it's power, but a very specific sort and not very lasting. Even a hoard of 4 or 5 barter may well be used in one stroke to pay for arming your gang (something my Savvyhead is just in the process of doing in the same game). We've never had an operator who cared much for barter, but with the hardholder we had in a previous game it was much more important that he lived in a bunker with a gang who took care of him, than that he had a few barter stashed. He had material power, but not defined by the rules but by the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343224/#Comment_343224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T04:29:57+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  4:29AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It has never really been front and center in any session I've played.

In the beginning, it seemed like yet another thing to keep track of and, as MC, I was having enough trouble handling other things.  However, as I become more comfortable running the game, I've realized that making barter really work is really important to many of the core responsibilities the MC has, especially <b>make AW seem real</b> and MC moves like <b>Make them pay</b> and <b>Take away their stuff</b>.  Sure, the game works mostly okay if you don't give barter much attention (it's a robust game that doesn't fail easily, for better or worse), but it gets stronger with barter in play.<br/><br/>That said, there are a few character types that can get the short end of the stick if barter is less important.  The Hardholder and the Maestro'D, definitely.  Probably the Operator and the Chopper too, since some of their moves are barter-related.  It's similar to the way that the Hocus and Chopper and Hardholder seem much less cool if you don't pay good attention to the rules for gangs, holdings, followers, etc.<br/><br/>Really, barter is fundamental to the idea of AW being about <b>scarcity</b>.  For my next game, I'm considering writing a couple custom moves to make sure barter is at the forefront, so I can learn how to use it properly in play.  For example,<br/><br/>When you need to eat and drink something, if you are in possession of something edible, nutritious, and/or hydrating, do so.  If not, you can choose to roll+barter spent (which can be zero) to acquire some vittles or something vaguely like it.  On a 10+, you're in the clear.  On a 7-9, you have terrible stomach pain but still got something out of it, take 1 harm but keep on trucking.  On a 6-, just the harm and you'll be ravenous and weak when you recover, -1 ongoing until you or somebody else gets you set up.<br/><br/>Might be a little harsh, as currently written, but it definitely gets the point across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343262/#Comment_343262" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T10:51:09+00:00" title="September 19, 2011 10:51AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game we are starting up right now has a Driver with a gas guzzling car and a Savyhead both in the employ of an Operator so I definitely thing Barter will play a bigger part in this game then previous games I have played.

This thread is useful to me.  Barter has not really been front-and-center in any of the several AW games I've played in or run.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's some bias against the tracking of resources that has kept some groups from really engaging with the Barter part of AW, even though, yeah, <b>scarcity</b>.<br/><br/>A lot of my groups stopped tracking things like XP, rations, ammo, etc. even in relatively crunchy games like D&amp;D some years ago.  When you sit down to play a game like Apocalypse World and you really want to focus on the characters and their relationships some of that stuff may just fall by the wayside without really even thinking about it as a conscious decision.  And maybe there are some missed opportunities as a result.
