It's been fun, creative and different every time we've played. One thing I noticed when playing collaborate storytelling games like <b>Archipelago, While the World Ends, Svart av kval - vit av lust, InSpectres</b> and <b>Fiasco </b>is that instead of depending on one person, the game experience depends on the whole group. But after a while - lets say a half year - with a single group, the difference that I felt was so thrilling from conventions has disappeared. People tend to do or come up with almost the same things over and over again. I'm sure that I'm not the only that have one noticed this..?<br/><br/>On a related note. A few years ago, I burned myself out as a game master. I started to improvise more and more loosely until it finally burned out all my imagination. I wanted to be different every time but after a while, I recognized patterns in my own imagination and it all felt the same. It got boring. I was so fed up with roleplaying games that I couldn't even think of playing it for a half year. I took a step back and started to plan out the scenarios more (and helped developed the fish tank model during that time). I took inspiration from different sources and got new input to my imagination.<br/><br/>Now while playing collaborate storytelling games in my group, I'm starting to loose the spark once again, just as when I felt burned out as a game master. It's always improv and I feel that my creative spark has faded. Is it really so that you only got a certain creative space? I wonder how to avoid that in the kind of storytelling games that I'm playing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410293/#Comment_410293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T05:59:11+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  5:59AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I avoid this by doing game design.

They do say that writers who are blocked and no longer enjoying their work should go play, so maybe the answer for people who are blocked and no longer enjoying their play is to...go do some work. Get some new information into your brain and let it make new connections.<br/><br/><br/>You could also try throttling back on how original and creative you feel you need to be in a game. What you did before was fun, right? I mean, if the only thing that appealed to you about gaming was the novelty factor, that'd be weird and kind of sad. Like EpistolaryRichard says, give yourself permission to not be creative for a while.<br/><br/>Also, get more sleep.

A lot of answers have been about me, but the trouble I'm having is also with the group. As I pointed before, I'm tired of the "Frame a scene, create a conflict, resolve it, frame a new scene" structure, but that's not the whole picture. I can play games with my group that have other kinds of structures and it still wears me out, but like I said in the first post, I have no trouble playing <b>InSpectres </b>on conventions. I know what I will bring to the table, so the surprise for me will be what the others will do.<br/><br/>When it comes to creating conflicts, the group usually falls back on somebody being killed, framed, raped or there's been a secret which involves incest or several people being with one person. Instead of getting a strong emotion from the twist, it's more of a "Oh, and here's the incest again. I was waiting for that".<br/><br/>When it comes to playing, I want to bring my kind of fantasy to the table. I don't know how many times I've inserted an ape king in <b>This Is Pulp</b> on conventions, because it will be a new thing for the new players. Play Unsafe tells us "Do the obvious thing" but that only works for a while. You can see this in the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway (an improv show I love), where you start to recognize the jokes after a while. This happens in the group as well, where we try to (naturally) escalate our imaginative story elements from one session to another - even if we're playing two different games - so we don't repeat ourselves. This means that stranger and stranger will be inserted in the story which means that we sometimes can't hold the story together because of those elements. Play Unsafe tells us to be dull and boring, but it's the same thing there. Dull and boring becomes repetitive after a while with the same group.<br/><br/>Storytelling games that we've played a lot seems to fall together because we wants to avoid to repeat ourselves, but strangely enough, also becomes boring to me (not the group) because we have the same kind of conflicts in the game. That's why I've started to question "conflicts" in roleplaying games and instead started to lean against "uncertainty" in stories. But the thing is, this is not something I feel in traditional games with a GM. Why is that? That when just one person have prepared a story, it becomes more interesting for me than if the whole group of people I normally play with improvises a story together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410371/#Comment_410371" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T07:46:23+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  7:46AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because the best stories were never created by committee.<br/><br/>Eventually in a group, no matter what kind of game you play, everyone learns each other's "moves". This means that you have increased familiarity and that's fun and comforting, but you almost completely lose the ability to surprise each other.  The way to beat this is to scramble up the group, add some new people, or maybe have everyone else play in a group that doesn't include anyone else for a while. Then you'll find yourself doing things differently and when you come back you will bring with you some new exciting stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410382/#Comment_410382" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T10:20:10+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 10:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2013 10:24AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard, I feel like I've experienced a similar thing!  A need for conflict arises and is identified, someone responds in a way that works well, and enjoyable conflict ensues, but then subsequently the process becomes predictable.  I think in collaborative improv, though the <i>nature</i> of a conflict might be surprising, the <i>timing</i> never is.  You never just find yourself in conflict unexpectedly.  No one has the authority to smack the rest of the group with "nope, no conflict, the NPC does what you want" and then later "boom, suddenly this happens, you <i>must</i> deal with it now!" the way a trad GM can.<br/><br/>I wonder if this could be overcome by every player in an improv game bringing some Sorcerer-style "bangs" to the table?  Encouraging individual, outside inspiration, as opposed to socially responsive crowd-pleasing?  Or some other system of competing for narration rights?<br/><br/>A few more specific thoughts:\n<blockquote>When it comes to creating conflicts, the group usually falls back on somebody being killed, framed, raped or there's been a secret which involves incest or several people being with one person.</blockquote>These sound to me like they describe a very small range of genres and tones.

I'm currently looking forward to try Kagematsu.\n<blockquote>I think I've experienced this most when it's "let's make a conflict for us, the players" time, and least when it's deep character study time.

In the beginning, where we had really good sessions in Svart av kval (see link above), where we played out a lot of scenes that established what we fought for and what we cared about. But in later sessions, we kind of skipped that part because we thought we knew how to play the game. We also have a short time limit (2-3 hours) which also contribute to the rush-it-over behaviour. And because we haven't established what we care about, it's common to insert kill/rape/incest in order to try to shock the others. It still works with people not in the group (we play at conventions too) but it's a known safe line for the rest of us.<br/><br/>This is something we addressed in the group, but I didn't realize that it also drained my creativity. That's an insight that I will cherish. I usually say "In order to improvise, you need to be prepared" so I feel kind of stupid for not seeing this relation. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>I wonder if this could be overcome by every player in an improv game bringing some Sorcerer-style "bangs" to the table?  Encouraging individual, outside inspiration, as opposed to socially responsive crowd-pleasing?

I myself have been thinking a lot about Dan Harmon's <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">story structure</a>, where you need to establish a Need to Go and Search for it. It's not before then you can Find what you searched for, but it will Take its toll in form of consequences.

The Daughters of Verona (improvising Shakespearean comedy) and While the World Ends (childhood friends) also resulted in really good sessions, but I think one cause to this was that we played these games with people we normally don't play with. The regular players from the group were then more careful to establish facts and build from that - something that we sometimes can skip.<br/><br/>There is something else I thought of that you wrote earlier.\n<blockquote>No one has the authority to smack the rest of the group with "nope, no conflict, the NPC does what you want" and then later "boom, suddenly this happens, you must deal with it now!" the way a trad GM can.</blockquote>\nA GM can with this above and certainly more tools/rules control the pacing. I think this is really important in a game, and when the game just leave the pacing up to the group then there's a higher chance of the game failing. It has nothing to do with what we talk about above and below, but it's something worth noticing.\n<blockquote>An attempt to "do things differently" seems like it'd be harsh on your psyche - kind of like going "don't think about pink elephants" and then whipping yourself when you do.

It worked in the beginning but now it's fallen apart and becoming clich\xe9. To be able to play out  more mundane things, like the ones you gave examples of, I think it has to be more grounded early in the game. Otherwise, it will burn out your imagination.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the help, everybody! I appreciate the insight I got.
