A seedy night shift doctor accidentally kills two people. A drug dealer dodges some good ole southern justice. And the reasonably straight daytime doctor and his cousin remind themselves that they aren't innocent either. <br/><br/>I was the seedy night shift doctor, and it turned out pretty bad for me. After poisoning the sheriff to cover for my secret counterfeit drug operation, I accidentally shot the day doctor's cousin while trying to hide the body. During the aftermath, I was trying to throw everything I had in a bag so I could flee and ended up accidentally poisoning myself and dying. <br/><br/>I don't remember many of the other details, but the best part was that the final aftermath point was the day shift doctor's cousin's corpse rotting under a railroad bridge, her favorite techno tune playing on a loop on her MP3 player. I'm pretty sure nobody got higher than a 3 or 4 for their aftermath totals. <br/><br/>All in all, the game works really, really well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249213/#Comment_249213" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T18:45:07+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  6:45PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/145421761_0fa4501f2d.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249251/#Comment_249251" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T09:16:55+00:00" title="December 31, 2009  9:16AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're struggling with Play by Wave--up to Scene III (since November 13th!).<br/><br/>It's an awesome situation generator with a pretty freeform system ("resolution system" doesn't even really apply, as I see it).

I'm not sure which one it will be yet but I have seven ready to go, including sets from Graham Walmsley, Chris Bennett, and Tom Gurganus. We're trying to figure out the best way of supporting other people's playsets now, but custom sets are highly encouraged. Josh Mannon just told me about one he's working on that will be <i>hilarious.</i> Chris Bennett and I are writing up Dallas, November 1963. There will be a lot of support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249258/#Comment_249258" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T10:30:53+00:00" title="December 31, 2009 10:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any "meta-advice" for authoring playsets?

There are stories built into each one - the Boomtown set has a whole deep thread about Chinese immigrants, and I think part of the reason the sets work is that by absorbing the various choices during the setup, you get a feel for the time and place, even though you are only choosing a fraction of the elements as critical to the fiasco. So if you play Boomtown, you're reading over all this stuff about opium and the laundry and the brothel so forth, even if you don't choose those elements they are in the back of your mind as you play, and they may come out. If you need details, they are provided. <br/><br/>Unlike IAWA, the playsets are just lists of stuff that means very little until combined with relationships. Some are wildly colorful and some are very mundane, and a balance of the two is nice for pairing with mundane or colorful relationships. It's a way to adjust the gonzometer and make a statement about the sort of tone you want. So a playset should have a good balance of crazy evocative stuff and really prosaic stuff. One of my favorite Locations is "medical records coding office" - so tedious, so boring, so invisible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249271/#Comment_249271" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T12:31:57+00:00" title="December 31, 2009 12:31PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advice--sounds pretty much like I'd imagine.

We made it halfway through the first act, played through 5 scenes (out of the first 8). :-)<br/>I think we spent a little longer on the scenes, I think we were just having way too much fun with it, but on that I have to say  'oh well.' We had a great time and the system only encouraged us to expound upon the opportunities provided us because of the system...so naturally we ran with it and ended up creating excellent scenes. We have not hit the tilt yet and I am betting when we do the game will simply go from good to great.<br/>The "constraints" provided in the opening through the sort of oracle in the playset at first seem like they might be restricting but wow, it really helps steer the game and helps push the players towards interesting scenarios. If you have played a game like inSpectres, this sort of has the same thing going on in the background, but a completely different feel, a much darker, doomed feel.<br/>All in all, great job Jason!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250192/#Comment_250192" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-09T20:56:44+00:00" title="January  9, 2010  8:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Why that makes you think of Jerry Lewis I cannot guess.

There was Big Ron, the crime boss looking for revenge on the Crimewatch TV presenter who put him away by running the story. Then his underling with some useful contacts for their little scheme, and his former Alcoholic's Anonymous buddy Alex  who happened to be the very put-upon production manager working on Crimewatch at the BBC who hates the presenter with a passion for overworking him and treating him like meat. By sheer coincidence, before the AA he did Ron a few favours and an uneasy friendship developed with... certain tensions (but they're not shagging, or anything... no...).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plan was clear. Get some high grade weed, this time not for selling, but for the biggest poetic stitch-up ever devised. Dump the goods in TV-guy's Spanish villa, then arrange it so that it looks like the hapless sod is responsible for smuggling the goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Ron and his underling manage to get poor Alex to both agree to help and give up useful information about the villa through a combination of drugs and drink that undoes most of the hard work that AA had achieved with him over the last few years, but the scheme was well under way. At the midway point, an ill advised attempt at bribery lands the criminal pair in a holding cell on a ferry, but that was where we had to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust before we did, however, we rolled up the tilt, the most wonderful potentially disastrous element being 'Failure: Something precious is on fire.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257917/#Comment_257917" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T13:33:36+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  1:33PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Silk</cite>Just before we did, however, we rolled up the tilt, the most wonderful potentially disastrous element being 'Failure: Something precious is on fire.'</blockquote>DUUUUUDE, stand down wind! <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264263/#Comment_264263" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T08:35:21+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  8:35AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2010 8:36AM by Matthijs.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think part of the reason the sets work is that by absorbing the various choices during the setup, you get a feel for the time and place, even though you are only choosing a fraction of the elements as critical to the fiasco.</blockquote>\nHey, that's very true!
