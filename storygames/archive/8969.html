Mike, I'm very glad to hear that, since this ashcan is much more about vetting the text (which hasn't yet been released into the wild) than changing the rules (which playtests have honed pretty sharp already). If it looks good at first glance, hopefully it'll hold up under the second and third!<br/><br/>Rob, that's a great point, and definitely something I do my best to get under control with stuff like the spheres of authority and veto options described in that section's bullet points. The rule/philosophy came about from observing the way people naturally adjudicated all the "freeform" parts of the game, i.e., outside the Conflict structure, and was informed by similar rules in <i>Wushu</i>, <i>Mortal Coil</i>, and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. It's supposed to be the same sort of "you need to please the pickiest player at the table" attitude toward additions to the fiction, uses of traits, etc. that you find in those games. Have you found those structures to lend themselves too much to personality-based power?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
