It is also cross posted to "Design Help" over in Praxis.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on designing a game, and am about to start the very first round of playtests. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to do this in person as I'd prefer, so I'm going to give it a shot using Google Wave. My game is about conflicting loyalties and interests within a clan inspired by Celtic, Germanic, and even Mycenaean Greek mythic society (so, kind of Beowulf meets Mabinogion meets Homer). If this sounds at all interesting to you, send me a whisper or an email, and let me know if you need a google wave invite. I'll also be happy to provide more information if anybody is on the fence.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
