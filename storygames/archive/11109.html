There's a lot of talk in the <i>Apocalypse World</i> rulebook about asking questions of the players, drawing situations and story hooks from them, placing them in situations where they are forced to respond creatively and then building from there.  This is textbook emergent gameplay, because it relies on a synergy between player and GM to create something cooperatively.<br/><br/>This intimidates me.<br/><br/>A little background, then.  I've been out of the GMing game for close to five years at this point and before that I was firmly in the traditionalist-gaming camp; I created worlds, plots and characters and the players worked their way through them.  There was basically nothing in common with the way I played and the emergent-gaming style.  This isn't to say it doesn't interest me \u2014 otherwise why would I be on a site called Story Games? \u2014 but it also means I have no real frame of reference to draw on when potentially running <i>Apocalypse World</i> or any other game that relies on emergent gaming to achieve its full effect.<br/><br/>To a certain extent I'm not yet even comfortable with emergent gameplay from a <i>player's</i> standpoint, as Benhimself's <i>Apocalypse World</i> game on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10236" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a> (get a pickup game today!) was the first time I'd <i>played</i> in nearly a decade.<br/><br/>But back to the GMing thing.  Are there any techniques you can share or advice you can give about easing into the emergent gameplay style?  There's an assumption out there that this is a new mode that can easily be grasped, but if you're as steeped in traditionalist gaming forms as I am (and many are) it's not so easy to let go of ultimate narrative power and let it flow.

If everyone's clear about how far their responsibilities extend, the thrust and intent of the rules, then these things usually work fine.<br/><br/>The main problem with indie gaming is not usually with the GM but more often with players who are unwilling to engage beyond just saying what their character is doing. And then when they find out what power they have, they tend at first to go overboard on using it, rather than having much regard for the developing narrative or the play of others.<br/><br/>It's just as well to warn your players about this by talking about the times when gameplay emerged in your traditionalist games, which I'm sure it has, unless your players never interact (which sounds unlikely). And the other thing is that most indie games work fine in traditional mode as long as the GM has either prepped something or is happy to improvise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246734/#Comment_246734" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T06:10:07+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  6:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 6:10AM by walkerp.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>There's an assumption out there that this is a new mode that can easily be grasped, but if you're as steeped in traditionalist gaming forms as I am (and many are) it's not so easy to let go of ultimate narrative power and let it flow. </blockquote>\nEmergent story certainly can come out of traditional GM'ing.  It's not an issue of trad versus storygame, but an issue of how open-ended you as a GM design your adventures or how open-ended the designer structures the game.  A traditional approach that leads to emergent gameplay is the Sandbox style, where you just set up a world and let your players go in and go wild.  You don't know what they are going to do or what is going to happen, beyond a general sense of how NPCs and situations will react to stimuli.  It's the players who choose the stimuli (not you) and you react accordingly.  The end result of that is emergent gameplay and can be rich and fun.  <br/><br/>When you GM, are you guiding the story and already have an idea in your mind of how it is going to end.  Are you seeding the campaign with clear and strong guideposts and triggers for the players so that it develops along a narrative line that you had already envisioned?  I'm not being critical here.  Some would call this practice a form of railroading and they aren't wrong.  But I also know that such a style can be quite fun for many players and I myself used to run campaigns along those lines.  The way to change is to teach yourself to let go and discipline your mind to stop building the story out in your head (a natural behaviour for certain types of GMs).  If your players are used to your style, you will have to be explicit about how you are going to approach things differently.  Talk with them about what you are trying to do.<br/><br/>The thing with Storygames is that they often are written with the intent that all the players will follow all the rules.  This is a crutch for you.  You can't fudge things to maintain your narrative control because the rules won't let you (I'm repeating a bit what Bret Gillan says above).  I haven't read Apocalypse World, but I've read most of Vincent's other games and it seems to me that if you do what the text says, you shouldn't be able to control the narrative.  On the other hand, you still need to do some prep work and have your GM information at hand and ready (to avoid the boring and scatterbrained).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246743/#Comment_246743" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T07:01:56+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  7:01AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even when you were playing so-called "traditional" games, a term which means nothing and which should be thrown into the dustbin of history and spit upon, all your gameplay was emergent, your plans meant nothing without player cooperation, which could only be given or withheld in the moment of play and which was given or withheld in varying degrees across the entirety of the game.

I was already improvising whenever the players did something, but by sharing the creative responsibility I was able to stop agonizing over plans and scene descriptions before every session. I used to find that the GM does two to three times more work on the game then the players do (if not more), but now they do maybe 25% more work, and I do 25% more than that (for a grand total of about half what I used to do).<br/><br/>That bit about asking questions and drawing out plot hooks, that's your defense against being scatterbrained and boring. If you're stumped and don't know how to proceed, just ask someone else. It's their game too, right?<br/><br/>Hopefully placing them in situations where they have to respond creatively is nothing new.<br/><br/>"Emergent play" isn't some new scary thing that you need to worry about. It should feel oddly familiar when you try it, and any difficulties it causes for you will probably be offset by the fact that it makes your job a bit easier. Once you get used to it, you'll probably be a better GM and a better Player because of what you learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246781/#Comment_246781" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T08:44:11+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  8:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This stuff isn't easy at all.

Like, if I wanted to run Poison'd again, I'd have to make sure the players knew that I wasn't fully comfortable with the GM role and assist their help in figuring out what I was supposed to do.  I know that, playing with some groups, they would be down with that and supportive, where others would be weirded out by the thought that I was at all lacking total confidence.  I would not play those games with the latter group, since that sounds like a recipe for disaster.  On the other hand, I could just play the game with folks who I know have enjoyed Poison'd in the past and learn from them.  There's probably a whole lot less frustration and pain in that latter process, but the former can also be a good way to learn, just more of an active effort.<br/><br/>If you don't have a local community to draw on, there are also those podcasts that are basically recorded game sessions and I'm sure some of them, like Paul Tevis' Polaris game, feature games that are more emergent and player-constructed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246783/#Comment_246783" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T08:46:26+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  8:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 8:47AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Damn those traditional gamers!

Always be ready with a challenge, and when they reply, always be ready to up the stakes for ultimate fun. <br/><br/>I feel like a better definition of a GM in this role is "Moderator". The players are doing alot of the work by taking the initiative, knowing what their characters want and how to bring that up in play, how to create inter-party drama (or party/npc drama) and basically how to hit on themes and situations in the game that are appropriate to the setting and genre. All you have to do is then frame scenes, set up the major conflicts, and tell them when to start rolling dice and when they've won the day. It's kinda like running a LARP with 20+ people in it. You can't be everywhere at once, so people roleplay, and when they need an NPC or a rule, they call you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246819/#Comment_246819" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T10:29:00+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emergent is a style of game now?<br/><br/>Guys?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246820/#Comment_246820" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T10:29:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, it occurred to me belatedly that I may <i>have</i> had an emergent-play experience prior to this.  The only thing was that it happened so long ago it had kind of slipped out of my gaming memory.<br/><br/>I was in junior high in the '80s, lived in a military area, came from a military family and, like many kids like me, had a fairly close attachment to the Vietnam War.  Many of us had a father or an uncle who'd been there.  Vietnam was still recent enough to seem <i>real</i> in a way WWII didn't.<br/><br/>At any rate, we used to have to huddle around outside before classes in this big cattle-pen like area without tables or chairs or anything like that.  And because we sometimes got tired of just shooting the breeze we would play an improvisational game we called "Mind Vietnam."<br/><br/>In "Mind Vietnam" there were no fixed characters, just a semi-generic GI who sometimes didn't even have a name.  What mattered was that he was in the shit and had to fight to survive.  Sometimes he was captured.  Sometimes he was hero.  Sometimes he just barely got his ass out of there when the hammer came down.<br/><br/>It was done without dice or a formal system of any kind.  It just sort of... happened.  I guess the key for me will be to get back to that mindset, only with a little more mechanical support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246821/#Comment_246821" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T10:30:31+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Emergent is a style of game now?</blockquote>\nYes.

It doesn't "scare" me per se. But I do have issues with it.<br/><br/>Initially I ran into some indie games that offered what <i>might</i> be considered "emergent gameplay properties." So like...fanmail in PTA. For someone who'd never experienced what happens when you introduce a mutual-admiration reward system, it's pretty neat to see in play. Or...how fallout dice end up working in DitV (small dice produce more bad fallout, etc. etc.). Or how players have to come together, outside the fiction but observing the fiction in this very authorial way, in BE in order to win Infection rolls.<br/><br/>Those were my first three, I think, non-trad RPGs I tried after a lot of years of Exalted, GURPS, whatever. I think the worm turned for me with BE.<br/><br/>Now, there's nothing wrong with the BE reward and feedback cycles. They're pretty much genius. However, what's missing is the fact that nowhere in the text does it lay out why things work the way they work. There is in fact no small level of belligerence on BWHQ's part to RTFM when it comes to pulling apart their games. So I went into BE's Infection mechanics with a preconception of how they "should" work, ground up against the Infection RAW, and never found an explanation within the text for what to expect from Infection-level play.<br/><br/>Then I started noticing this more and more in other indie games I played.<br/><br/>Man we've played a lot of them so it's hard to remember everything we've tried...there's the emotional one-ups-manship of Confessionals in InSpectres, for example. The ratcheting up of mutually incompatible orders in 3:16. The tension of the "win" condition in Agon. After a bit, it started to seriously annoy me that the (apparent) desire to have a Big Emergent Reveal baked into these games meant swaths of play were left unexplained on purpose.<br/><br/>I'm quite sure this is an older-gamer phenomenon. The younger indie-minded RPers I know have no issues at all with any of this, and in fact it's the mark of great game design and play to have the Big Emergent Reveal show itself. The new generation will follow game instructions and whatever happens, happens. For many of us, though, there are a LOT of assumptions about play that are hard to get past even when you're trying to follow the RAW.<br/><br/>This still bugs me sometimes, but now I'm getting better at eyeballing the psychological pushes and pulls of nu-skool mechanics. When I see a mutual-admiration mechanic, I can think of fanmail. When I see a pick-the-flavor-of-your-adversity mechanic, i can think of artha. And so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, this might have been where Sam was coming from. Or not.

But I really want to get at what the game wants me to get at! I greatly prefer to play in the game's proper spirit, rather than going in with the desire to break it. <br/><br/>So...if I know what the designer is trying to get at, I can reconsider the procedures with a different eye and make that bridge -- usually a Designer Not Included problem -- more easily. Being told to RTFM and play RAW is often inadequate for various reasons, some of which are my reasons and some of which are problems with the text.<br/><br/>This phenomenon was what ended up, <i>for example</i>, bugging me about 3:16 -- I couldn't quite suss out Gregor's intent for the last act's shape of play, so I couldn't work out some fuzziness in how Flashbacks work in a way that supported that vision. And, unfortunately, each of the two ways you can work Flashbacks result in a way, way different shape of play at the end.

Honestly, I've been thinking lately about the role of Games on Demand, the Indie Games Explosion, and demos and convention games in general in the overall indie games community / scene / whatever.  And they serve a huge supplemental role to the text in teaching how to play and socializing new players to the perspectives and techniques that are required to consistently deliver a certain style of play experience.  But, in isolation from that, sometimes it's hard to feel like you really "get it," even if you can email the designer or discuss games with folks on the Internet.  That's getting a bit beyond the Designer Not Included problem you mention (because often interactions with the designer ARE basically included in purchasing an indie game), but I think it's in similar territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246864/#Comment_246864" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:20:21+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That doesn't sound very "emergent" to me.<br/><br/>Isn't the whole point that each group comes up with something different, something unique rather than something secretly pre-programmed in by the designer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246869/#Comment_246869" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:33:43+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:33PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well..."emergent" is often used as indie code for "it's not in the rules but this thing happens when you use the rules."<br/><br/>Kind of like how you turn kids into fictional murderous thieves the minute you tell them the way to succeed in play is to gain XPs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246873/#Comment_246873" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:38:55+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:38PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You yourself just gave the definition and one of the important factors of this definition is that "it's not in the rules".

Though "unexpectedly" might be a bit heavy, after one is familiar with a game's fruitful void; the situation where the procedures of play do not DIRECTLY generate the Point of Play (PoP) means that the PoP is "emergent."<br/><br/>DitV's PoP is "explore what the players consider morally acceptable." There is not a single procedure which, for example, gives "moral resources" to shape that exploration or which demands that a "moral test" be made to progress to other procedures. Rather, the morality emerges from what the Dogs DO, what Fallout they accept (and apportion, via escalation), and how the GM pushes them to back up that decision with increased "weight" or "emotional freight."<br/><br/>By the same token, almost every "trad" game talks, somewhere, about "making a story" or "living an adventure" and yet don't have any sort of narrative procedures or resources (or even rights apportioning). The PoP emerges from the procedures, the GM-provided challenges and situations, and the PC reactions and (to an extent) what the player's choose to emphasize about actual play and how they advance their PCs.<br/><br/>A common shorthand for games which rely on emergence to get at their PoP is "Design What Doesn't Matter" (DWDM). "Design What Matters" (DWM) takes the opposite tack: the procedures all drive directly at the PoP. A lot of highly structured "indie" and LARP games are DWM.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246905/#Comment_246905" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T13:50:04+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  1:50PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>Yeah, we're starting to theorydrift or something.<br/><br/>In this context, Sam is using "emergent play" to describe games where the story emerges from the interactions of all the players instead of being directed by a single GM/Narrator/Writer/Overlord.<br/><br/>As many people have pointed out, even the most strictly managed "GM as author" style game has some "emergent" (in this context) elements, since the story will always include SOME input from the players.</blockquote>\nUm, yea.

Because I'm not trying to be derogatory using the term "railroady", it was just short-hand for a playstyle where the GM is dictating the overall development of the story.  I don't think that is contentious, is it?  Especially considering I already stated upthread that I myself used to run games this way and that many players enjoy it.<br/><br/>To clarify (and I think this is mostly what is in line with what David Artman is saying), I have heard a lot of proponents of traditional, GM-led, task-oriented play argue that the real fun comes from the things that happen during the course of the game that were not planned by the GM or thought ahead by the players.  I'm pretty sure the term "emergent" has been used in this context.  Their argument is that story games, by structuring the social and narrative elements of the game actually stifle the emergent play, because it's already been decided by the designer (in effect it's the designer who is dictating instead of the GM).<br/><br/>This is what confused me about the OP talking about "textbook example of emergent play".  What textbook are you all reading from?<br/><br/>And who doesn't want emergent play?

Some people preferred just knowing the rules in a slim pamphlet with no other designer's notes or strategy guides. I believe they wanted to discover all those properties on their own.<br/><br/>Others preferred to have as much material explained as possible, even if it meant that exposing some of the deeper emergent properties of play before the game was even played.<br/><br/>I tend to prefer the latter, which is probably why a relatively simple, procedural RPG is now over 100,000 words in the most recent draft.

Ryan Macklin put it like that <a href="http://masterplanpodcast.net/index.php?post_id=277173" rel="nofollow">here</a>.\n<blockquote>That is play that emerges from the people engaging and interactive with the text, but isn't a direct result of the instructions of the text.</blockquote>\nAnd one of his neat examples was about Diplomacy. That's a smart step to choose a boardgame because it decouples emergent play from whatever definition of RPG OneTrueWayist will try to slap on the hobby.  <br/><br/>I agree a lot with David Artman, except for this:\n<blockquote>A common shorthand for games which rely on emergence to get at their PoP is "Design What Doesn't Matter" (DWDM). "Design What Matters" (DWM) takes the opposite tack: the procedures all drive directly at the PoP.</blockquote>\nDavid, you already listed DitV as a good example of DWM with emergent play. There's contradicting here.<br/> <br/>It's probably a necessity for DWDM type of games to have built-in expectation of emergence. After all, all these rules that "don't address what matters" must be useful for something... Maybe convey some mood, some vision of what the game should play like. But since they are, by nature, rarely used, it's more of a build up for emergence, something brewing in between game sessions. Sometimes I even wonder if they're not some kind of meta anti flag, a warning sign by the designer: "I developed this mechanism/rule for this situation. I know it doesn't look fun or appealing... So just play with the other parts of my game. Kthxbye." <br/><br/>What seems difficult to assess is how much emergent gameplay derives from conscious efforts or happened at random during a playtest and later the game designer tried to capture it with a blindfold on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247137/#Comment_247137" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T13:08:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  1:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>David, you already listed DitV as a good example of DWM with emergent play.

There is not a single procedure which, for example, gives "moral resources" to shape that exploration or which demands that a "moral test" be made to progress to other procedures.</blockquote>That's DWDM, all the way (lack of "morality mechanics"). It's PoP emerges from the fruitful void that is surrounded by the system element interactions. (This is almost verbatim Baker quoting, now, FWIW.)<br/><br/>Also, I think there's some confusion (vis a vis my stuff) here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>After all, all these rules that "don't address what matters" must be useful for something... Maybe convey some mood, some vision of what the game should play like. But since they are, by nature, rarely used, it's more of a build up for emergence, something brewing in between game sessions.</blockquote>Absolutely not--I've somehow mangled language or something.<br/><br/>DWDM rules aren't "rarely used"--in fact, they are often the MOST used rules: D&amp;D positioning and marking rules; GLASS's Abilities and Calls and timings; DitV Trait invocation and conflict escalation. DWDM designers don't say anything like, "I know it doesn't look fun or appealing... So just play with the other parts of my game. Kthxbye." rather, what they are 'saying' is more like:<br/><br/>"This game is about FOO and the exploration of BAR. Here are rules that handle all the other (often simmy) stuff you'd expect to be able to handle quickly and fairly, so that the game can move on to exploring FOOBAR."<br/><br/>As an example, let me describe SOLAR/NERO and GLASS, as a DWDM designer:<br/>* SOLAR/NERO is a VERY genre-bound game with a lot of specific handling rules, varied and dissimilar systems, and a competitive arms race built into the mechanics.<br/>* GLASS is a generic system with generalized rules for all effects with only a few, very logical and obvious Calls, and a built in design against arms races by only allowing a single side of an opposed dichotomy of system to be advanced.<br/><br/>Both systems provide rules for doing live combat with ways to extend your natural ability--your "hard skills"--with mechanical elements--"soft skills" (or, for most of GLASS, ways to model tropes which are unsafe or impractical to do in real life with hard skills).<br/><br/>In THEORY, both NERO and GLASS games want to "tell stories of adventure and daring-do." But in PRACTICE, playing NERO is tricky, confusing, and generally about buffing to the moon so as to win a boffer combat in one swing. Yet GLASS is very fast, generally quiet (not chaotic with constant Calls and precise incantations which one can fizzle) and focused on hard skill. Which system "gets out of the way" of the story and adventuring objectives more, would you imagine?<br/><br/>And it's not true to say something like "Well, NERO's PoP is the competition elements, and they are thus DWM," because, if so, they'd be SCA or run fest LARPs, not try to manage game-wide plot lines, have season-long story build-ups, etc--all stuff that the system does NOTHING to engage or provide handle for (no Hero Points or Plot Tokens or Narrative Coins, here!).<br/><br/>I guess it comes down to the fact that (for fantastic sport LARP), players expect ot be able to do certain things, be it with hard or soft skill, but the REAL PoP is to "be a hero" or "tell epic stories" (or "get laid" or "build a faction that pwnz the whole game" or whatever)--all emergent results of a game system that is "merely" designed to provide balance; allow player adjudication of simple combat/conflicts; and enable fast and clear communications of game state in chaotic battles, at night, with only moonlight to guide you.<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: If one reads the GLASS rules closely, there is a BIT of DWM-for-'story'-creation in there, in the form of Player Priority rules and Situational Abilities. Feature creep and too many reviewers....)<br/><br/>Clearer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247149/#Comment_247149" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T13:26:20+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  1:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>And who doesn't want emergent play?

For example, a critical examination of religion emerges from Dogs in the Vineyard play, though the mechanics largely avoid religion. A game about religion where the mechanics avoid talking about religion?!!!!??! That's a fruitful void right there, a secret deposit of valuable ore that Vincent hopes the players will strike, since he's armed them with pick-axes and a mountain.<br/><br/>So, does everyone want important parts of the game obscured from them, in the hopes that they hit them "emergently"?

Everyone keeps telling me what an awesome job the game does as setting up things for the MC so that preparation isn't necessary, which would seem to preclude even some basic stuff that I, as a GM of long standing, would take for granted.<br/><br/>The idea of putting a few character-specific hooks into the game doesn't seem all that disruptive to me, and maybe I'm just reading Vincent's text wrong (again).

I see this in <i>Burning Wheel </i>threads too, where someone will post about the game being "in the player's hands" and the GM only "reacting to what the players do." Complete bullshit. Generally, even the most player empowered games demand that the GM, if there is one, act as a important catalyst for play at the table.<br/><br/>One critical difference is that Bangs are questions for which the GM has no prepared answer. They're questions based upon the flags that the group created together, so they should be on point. But, the player gets to answer them in play and by so doing defines their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247389/#Comment_247389" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:52:20+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:52PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 1:53PM by Emily_Care.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><br/>The idea of putting a few character-specific hooks into the game doesn't seem all that disruptive to me, and maybe I'm just reading Vincent's text wrong (again).

That way you can tell what the players really mean to do with them, and the world.  <br/><br/>Also, don't be afraid of dropping threats that aren't sparking with the players.In a game Vincent ran, the powerful brother of our Brainer was clearly looking like a threat--but Vincent realized the brother had no juice and dropped him from focus.  This allowed him to spend time following up on a three-way going on between our Brainer, her gang leader lover, and a demonic assistant who possessed the lover. Tangled, awful and dangerous to everyone in the hold. <br/><br/>The GM should be a catalyst, but the game puts the shaping and molding of the world into the players hands, which means that as a GM instead of creating world leverage for yourself to bonk them with, you are paying attention to what they bring up, and turning it against them at every turn. <br/><br/>Not that this doesn't mean you shouldn't bring in outside threat. I'd imagine starting with some nice external pressure, then following up all the leads your players give you to create internal and external nastiness, would go a long way in running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I fear emergent gameplay. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11109/i-fear-emergent-gameplay/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="I fear emergent gameplay. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11109/i-fear-emergent-gameplay/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I know DitV is the canonical example of DWDM, but... what about the GM rules?

"Actively revealing the town in play" is supposed to get the PCs involved in the town's impending catastrophe without dicking around with investigating or other activities that are beside the point.</blockquote>Now we are having a bit of terminology debate.<br/><br/>The Town Creation "rules" in DitV are not procedures. Rather they are advice for "aiming" the players so that they do not engage the actual procedures in conflicts that don't advance the PoP, which is (as has been noted) the exploration of the PLAYERS' concepts of morality and sin. That's where "Say Yes" comes in Big Time: it's the ultimate, Rule Zero for DWDM--look, here's a rule that says the players get whatever they want IF it has nothing to do with the central PoP of exploring morality. Want to know if the Steward's lying? YES, he is--because the PoP is not "figure out who is trustworthy and who is a liar;" but rather the PoP is "decide who is sinning and deal with them; oh, you did it with a bullet ot the head--OK, how about NOW that it's a small girl? OK, how about now that it's your younger sister?"<br/><br/>Each of those "OK, how about NOW" rampings up of the pressure would be hamstrung by a gyrating "investigation" to find the next culprit. So you Say Yes; and you don't have procedures for Detect Lie or Interrogation, whereas a game like CoC, which is ABOUT the slow reveal and building horror, DOES have such skills as ways to mete out information (or misinformation, on failures) to pace the build-up. (And "trad" CoC is DWM--look at the Sanity mechanics, if nothing else, and it should be obvious!)<br/><br/>[This might warrant another thread, as we've gone all termy about System; but apparently the OP was mainly dealing with something in the social contract or player agency or some-such.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248125/#Comment_248125" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T13:47:10+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  1:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a>: what I'm about to say probably merits another thread, too, but this: <blockquote>Want to know if the Steward's lying?

Not to mention as a play technique - with sort of an element of aggressive scene-framing in there, like, <br/><br/>GM: "Okay, you hide in the forest from the king's men? Well, that's fine."<br/>Player A: "I make a successful Hide check. We're going to wait here a few days."<br/>Player B: "I don't have a skill that lets me find food. Are we going to starve out here?"<br/>GM: "Nope! We're not playing a game about survival in the wilderness."<br/>Player A: "What if the king's men made a point of killing all the game in the area, to starve us out of hiding?"<br/>GM: "Well, okay, that'd be different, since that addressed the conflict between you and the soldiers."<br/><br/>There might actually be whole parts of play that get decided by group fiat, but not quite Drama, since it's not a conflict as far as the game is concerned. A lot of things that might occupy the rules in one kind of game just don't merit "rulings" in another, by GM, player, or game text, and thus such things are Color, kind of.

I pretend I'm a player, but I have several characters to play (all the NPCs). Then I play them. Like, "what does this guy want?" and then go try to get that. The restriction is, I have to frame the scenes around the PCs. So I only get to play my characters if they have interests that intersect with the PCs (which they do, of course, usually because the game* we're playing makes sure we do that when making characters).<br/><br/>So, in my head, I take off my "GM" hat and put on my "Player" hat. It's kind of a secret thing for myself, but it puts me in the right frame of mind. I don't have to worry about "the story" or "the plot" or whatever...

Second, it prepares me for wherever the players might go in the story, giving me a strong foundation from which I can improvise. And lastly, setting up a sandbox gives me something to fall back on in the possibility that the players are having an off-night and want me to drive the story for a bit.<br/><br/>If you look at them abstractly, DitV's town rules and Sorcerer's Relationship Maps are nothing more than sandboxes. Same principle as the old numbered hex-maps. Just defined on a different level. <br/><br/>I do sandbox prep for all the games I run. Whether it's a UML-style diagram of the various factions or parties and their conflicting interests. Or an old-school map. For some games, I do both.<br/><br/>It's just nice to have a handle on who's who and what they want, in case the PCs decide they want to help out the evil sorceress instead of the townsfolk. And to the players it seems like magic. Because no matter where they go, it seems as though that's where I thought they'd go anyway.<br/><br/>Even though I'm improv'ing about 80% of the entire session.<br/><br/>I guess that could be a factor. I mean, it's sort of a Wizard of Oz situation. I'd recommend playing in a game to get a feel for it before trying to run it. But then again, I'm not sure whether the techniques that I'm using would be apparent. Maybe sitting in on prep and also playing the game would help more?<br/><br/>I mean, if you could see the way I prep for a Mountain Witch game and then play in and observe how that game unfolds. You'd probably pick up a lot more of those GM tricks than by just playing. And I can't think of any text that could be read that might substitute for something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249117/#Comment_249117" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T08:32:44+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  8:32AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>No. The thread will continue to drift until we're discussing why<i>Mouse Guard</i>is the best hack for<i>Transformers</i>.</blockquote>\nHmm.
