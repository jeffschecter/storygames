Threats never seem to hang togther nicely.  They always seem like a kludge when we put them on the board.  There rarely seems like any rationale or back-story to why the threats are attacking, or even threats in the first place.  And furthermore, threats are usually faced by the players serially, and based on the number of threats per hero, the threats crush the danger meter after two or three turns.  When we use the village variant from Pocket Gamma Patrol the village is doomed so fast, that it ruins the fun.<br/><br/>I think we are playing the RAW, so I can't figure out where everything is going off the rails.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451618/#Comment_451618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-24T01:50:27+00:00" title="February 24, 2016  1:50AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over 40 views but not one comment?

As the rules say, "bonus dice never count for danger results." If you count dangers from those d8s, you'll lose really fast, so maybe that could be what's going on in your game.<br/><br/>As for rationale or backstory to the threats, I can only say try talking about it at your table. Ask, "so why is this Inter-dimensional Monstrosity attacking Rocket City today?" It might be fun and you might find a deeper sense of plot and character floating up into your mind as soon as you and your friends consider the question for a few minutes. You might even have a look at the "Create a Space Adventure" chart from <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lasers and Feelings</a> to give you some good inspiration, or making up one like it on your own, using some of the words from the Threat-O-Matic in Pocket Danger Patrol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451640/#Comment_451640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T03:34:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  3:34AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I found this <a href="http://http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18197/dangerquest-gm-ful-procedure" rel="nofollow">set of house rules</a> added to the base game, which might be of some use to you. You could consider taking some or all of that (such as flashbacks or establishing threats at the start) and adding it into your game. You can also have a look at <a href="http://http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=440" rel="nofollow">this replay</a> and see what they're doing. For instance, at the outset it's clear from their list of threats that they've done a bit of expanding on the basics to see how they all fit into one cohesive situation.

Before we choose from among them, I mention a few things for everyone to keep in mind about coherence and connections and it seems to work OK. This bit from that AP is fairly representative:<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s line up the adjectives and the nouns like this, in a couple of columns more or less, and let\u2019s eliminate all but five on each side. We'll pair them up to make the five Threats that the Danger Patrol is dealing with in this final episode. We\u2019ll be determining the scope and the nature of these final scenes based on what kind of Threats we decide are most entertaining. Let\u2019s start by brainstorming some possible pairings. So, as you feel it, just go ahead and promote or demote some of these cards by moving them up or down the column here. Let\u2019s consider which will fit together to form a coherent story, and make sure that we have Threats that are the result of other Threats, and they\u2019re all related to each other."<br/><br/>Afterwards, I put a blank Danger Meter card on the table "to represent the thing we\u2019re protecting. The Threats will attack it each turn and if it\u2019s hit too many times then we lose. Let's decide what it means if we lose, what will be lost? What's being threatened?" It's usually Earth or The City or Reality. In that last game, it was Freedom. When a Threat hits the Danger Meter at the end of a round, I ask the Threat's owner to describe how the Threat just brought us that much closer to the end.<br/><br/>And I just thought of another house rule that I sometimes use: if everyone agrees that a Threat is still too conceptually isolated after the opening flashback round, I'll ask the table to come up with a new Complication that's somehow associated with both that isolated Threat and another better developed Threat, then put that Complication card in between those Threat cards to draw more attention to them and their connection.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what's causing the balance issue you mentioned, that must be frustrating. I'm actually not sure if the RAW is balanced, I only played it a couple of times before twisting it into a shorter GM-less shape with (players+1) Threats instead of (p+3), a 6-8 box Danger Meter and slightly lower Ability scores. Wins far outweigh losses, which players seem to enjoy. Sometimes I even bump a couple of Threats up to 8 or 10 hits but we still usually win with a heroic sacrifice or two at the end. For a while, I was ruling that the final game-ending Danger Meter hit could be cancelled by a hero Taking themselves Out to stop it. Maybe something like that would help?<br/><br/>Good luck, I hope this is useful!<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
