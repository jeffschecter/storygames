But I think people are just mining here for inspirado. So:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I have a sort of love/hate relationship for it, Stafford incorporated about as much cultural theme into a RPG setting as one possibly could with Glorantha. And its' only gotten better. In fact, the problem with it is that it's possibly too much. I could quickly identify 20 areas to play in, each with it's own disparate premise for play. My favorite right now is the scenario I have in which we examine the effects of parochialism (and perceptions of Civilized/Barbarian natures) on certain syncretic religious groups located in a secluded high upland locale. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I think about Glorantha, another completely different premise comes to me. Throw a dart at the map, and...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do new oceangoing trade-routs affect island cultures previously sequestered for centuries? <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on and on. Taken in small local doses like this, Glorantha is a wonderful place to play. Just don't try to consume it all in one game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Tekumel and Talislanta have this sort of stuff if you sorta read into it a bit. In that any time you have two realistic cultures interacting, you're probably going to be able to come up with some premise. I've posited that you could probably even find premises in Greyhawk if you squint enough (even if very straightforward). Like "what's life like for the peasant in the baronies of the Bandit Kingdoms, stuck between the righteous forces of Furyondy in the Shield Lands, and the evil beings of the realms of Iuz and the Horned Society?" I'm thinking it's got to be like Germany in the 30 years war. Do you stay when 90% of the population is dying around you? How do you survive if you do? If not, where do you go? Become a slave of the humanoids? Or be jailed by the Furyondians for serving under corrupt barons? Some possible Casablanca-esque stuff, too, if you consider it's costal position on the Nyr Dyv, where folks must wait, and wait, and wait, for ships to come to take them to the promised land of Greyhawk. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't use the old hexmap... use this: http://www.dancingshaman.net/blood/greyhawk1.jpg<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying is that if you look on your game shelf, everything you need is already there somewhere. You just have to approach it from the SG perspective (and hopefully play it with a SG), to get a SG out of play. Just don't get sucked in by the useless sim stats like how many horsemen each suzerainty can summon. Where details are absent, consider this a fruitful void to be filled to create just the sort of thematic play you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130500/#Comment_130500" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T08:49:27+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  8:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to represent for Blue Planet here.

I have a lot of Planescape stuff (still! On my shelf! but a lot of that is Tony DiTerlizzi signed books and artwork), but I only played it a handful of times. The best experience I got out of it was to "fuck Sigil" and set up a "situation". This was like 1996, long before The Forge or anything like that. I said, "I want to run a game where the characters wake up with amnesia, have a colored gemstone implanted in their foreheads, start off at first level, have flashbacks to their previous life, and interact with the gods in surreal experiences in the outer planes". We then did that. Lasted about 4 adventures before college crunches caused me to cancel the game, but it rocked. <br><br>You just need to set up an overall feel and situation for playing the game. The default situations in Planescape were the faction wars in Sigil, and the "War between Hell and Hades". I thought the latter was boring, and the former was SHIT: You buy this game which is all up about exploring the mysteries of the outer planes, and all they have you do is fight out philosophies in a big city that only minimally interacts with the planes? WTF? Bring in the outer planes, though, and you have something.<br/><br/>-One PC is a dead character questing to Olympus to return to the mortal world.

There are some really deep themes, cool toys and wicked storylines to be mined from the 30+ books that make up the RIFTS world.<br/><br/>Another one would be The Morrow Project.

So much story potential there.<br/><br/>I mean, it's easy enough to run an action/adventure task resolution style game in Justifers, with the characters pitted against various terrain and fauna challenges, but the game becomes even more interesting when you start throwing in story complications.<br/><br/>Players arrive on Tarvus 4 in the unexplored Tarvus system.  Initial scans indicate that the planet is rich in valuable mineral deposits.  Unfortunately, it's also inhabited by a primitive race that has no chance of resisting corporate enslavement.  The players are themselves slaves, with only the slimmest chance of earning their freedom...and the bounty on this planet would go a long ways towards paying off their Buy Back.  DRAMA!  Do you save yourself by selling out the natives?  Do you condemn yourself to more service and more danger (and more blind jumps!) by lying to your superiors?  Or do you do something really gonzo, like tell the corporation the truth AND mobilize the natives to throw resist your own masters?<br/><br/>The expansions for Justifiers, which introduced concepts like The Shadow Corporation, the Beta Resistance Movement, and Free Haven (a planet controlled by escaped Beta slaves) add even more complications.   What if half the party wants to try to skip out and head for Haven, and the other half wants to earn their freedom so they can be truly free and not merely a fugitive.  DRAMA!<br/><br/>And since the rules allow for human characters, you have another thread there.  Imagine how fun it would be to play a human who signed up for Justifier duty to make money superfast, and was given command over a crew of less-than-human man-beasts.  Dealing with issues of prejudice, speciesism, othering, so much potential!  Or one could play a Convict, sentenced to Justify for his crimes...but secretly you work for the Shadow Corporation!  DRAMA!  Or combine both: a human forced to confront his own racist views when he's thrown in with the beast men, who point out that his punishment is the life they were created for.  Where's your superiority now?<br/><br/>KEVIN:  Hell Yes.

The basic idea is that each story revolves around the Organization. The Organization maintains a series of local offices and each office is run by a copy of an AI operating a cloned bioroid (in other words each office is run by the exact same employe and each is named "Mr. Burke" and the only difference between them are their individual experiences), and the Organization maintains a huge network of freelance specialists. Before each story the players design one or more characters or pick any of the existing characters - in that way you usually only play the same characters for two or three sessions, then we move on to a new locale and new characters.<br/><br/>(The basic structure was inspired by the Global Frequency comic).<br/><br/>It allows us to dwell on all kinds of themes. Right now we're playing a huge ensemble-story (think Short Cuts the movie with some 12-15 characters), whose only plot is all the constellations possible and we've use special TSoY-keys to support this structure, and it plays out in the shadow of the first space elevator on earth (10 miles tall at the moment) being build in the 22nd c. up and coming nation of Kenya, so it is the meeting of the hypermodern society with a lowtech, traditional 20th c. society symbolized with the construction of the Space Elevator.<br/><br/>We're already thinking about next story which will take place in LA, dealing with drugs, crime and digital copies of human minds, hence we keep working with identity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130966/#Comment_130966" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T13:08:48+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  1:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look at the cover of a game, and I see something evocative.

Like Fading Suns. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is precisely my disappointment with all of the potential that I felt with these previous games that made two decades of my life a love/hate relationship with RPGs. And my elation with Story Games is precisely from the realization that I can now get those two decades back. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, don't get me wrong. When I say that you have to really sqint to get something like Al Quadim to provide what it pretends to profer from it's cover art, you really, really, really have to squint hard at the text. Don't do it if you have Earthdawn on the shelf, because that's far less squinty (heck, the magic item rules still tempt me on occasion). The themes are much more present and approachable. With a Glorantha or Talislanta, all you have to do is ignore the mechanics listed in the text. That takes very little squinting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there's definitely better and worse here. I personally think that you can make an entire game of play off of even the least inspiration. But if you're perusing the game shelf for ideas, pick the ones with the least squinting required. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those looking for more in-depth treatments of some of these settings, check out the "awesemofy" threads (various spellings). But, frankly, while people talk about having enough games, what I think we have enough of is setting. Enough to last a lifetime, I think. Going to take me two decades just to play through the ones I already own.

My first Exalted game using the Exalted rules was about a band of Solars, trying to travel north back to the homeland of one of the Solars to defeat the Deathlord that killed his tribe, with the last remains of his tribe in tow, and getting mixed up with an insane mutant Solar and the Dragon Bloods that tried to kill him.<br/><br/>In my current Exalted game, using HeroQuest, it's about three Solars trying to grow out from their protective isolation to build an empire to defeat the realm. They have mortal and god allies, rival kingdoms blustering against their power, and beset by demon pirates and a large Realm satrapy. They're building relationships, and trying to hold off their enemies as best they can until they are ready to strike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132994/#Comment_132994" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T14:00:22+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  2:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But, of course, things will come to a head too early, and those relationships will be strained, and then we'll see who is made of what...<br/>\n<br/>\nAhem.
