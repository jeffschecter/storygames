It's evolved since then and our current objective seems to be (it's unstated but is evolving in a particular direction) that it work, stand alone (to the extent it can), and be pretty.  So now we are in the last stages of editing and the early stages of layout/typesetting.  It's late to ask others to have a look but I will anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf such an abomination interests you I would very much like to hear your impressions.  Our intention is to print it up nicely for us, but as we're likely to use Lulu, if someone else wants a copy they will be able to buy one.  My expectation is that the overlap between Traveller and SotC gamers is very thin indeed--my table may represent the whole of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find the latest versions <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Spirit+of+the+Far+Future" rel="nofollow">at the wiki main page for it</a>.  The Feb 5 unformatted PDF contains all of the rules but the ogranization is not final and the layout has nothing to do with our intended presentation.  The typeset draft of book 1 is a near-complete edit of part of the whole and the layout is largely where I intend all four books to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can play it I'm doubly interested.  Maybe more.  If you try and can't then I'm triply interested -- I really have no idea if this stuff makes any sense to anyone but we who have already played it a lot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128863/#Comment_128863" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T18:47:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:47PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested, as my passing fascination with both merits this a look.

So there's no overall AP really though there has been some Actual Play, if you follow.  It plays like SotC except any given violent conflict could easily end in death, so it's very much oriented towards social conflicts.  This matches up with our Traveller experiences in both cause and effect, so that's a plus for us.  The gun-porn is just enough (think Book 4) to make military wargaming with the combat subsystem a hoot.  The starship combat subsystem is Agon in space and vastly (humble much Brad?) improves on the Traveller system while using the exact same underlying ship design system.<br>But, as I feared, I am highly biased.  As the table is full of the designers, it's very hard to tell whether the good stuff is our fault or coming out of the text.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128895/#Comment_128895" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T20:12:30+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been aware of this for a while, so I'm, interested.

From that any discussion of language or aesthetics in the product proper would be most welcome.<br/><br/>When we package this up at Lulu we will sell a colour and a B&amp;W version.  The colour version will be prohibitively expensive and have only the tiniest of profit margins on it.  It will probably work out to around $15/book with 4 books in the set.  These are really for my bookshelf.  The B&amp;W version will be priced to make a slightly larger profit and probably go out at $10/book.  All books will be 6" x 9" saddle stitched just like (-ish) the LBBs.<br/><br/>Once all the typesetting is done we may produce a single indexed document a la the SRD.  We will probably also continue to make the PDFs of the typeset version available for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129089/#Comment_129089" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T09:38:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 9:45AM by Caesar Slaad.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Halfjack, a few things.<br/><br/>First - I tried to sign up for the wiki to get a look behind the scenes.

Is it just starting out?<br/><br/>Here's what I wanted to post there:<br/><br/>I read the three books and thought that Worlds could use more elaboration. I think using the original Traveller UPP is a good idea, but I would also include a section on how this generates Aspects -- and maybe even Stunts -- for the world.<br/><br/>Eg Corrosive Atmosphere, Law Level 9, Charismatic Dicatorship, etc. etc. Also, the Trade Classifications from orig Traveller generate Aspects: Industrial world, Agricultural world, Desert world, etc. <br/><br/>Also, a player rolled Planetology skill or Galactography roll might generate aspects physical or cultural Aspects for a world.<br/><br/>As for Stunts, you might have:<br/>Low Gravity -- Zero-G skill restricts Dexterity when moving.<br/>High Gravity -- Endurance restricts Dexterity when moving.<br/>etc.<br/><br/>In a recent experiment with forum play of Traveller, a group of us had a great time explaining the UPPs of a sector, create a thumbnail sketch of conditions, habitation, and culture.<br/><br/>These are ideas I'd really like to see in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131981/#Comment_131981" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T15:07:53+00:00" title="March  2, 2008  3:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good thoughts, Alan, thank you.

One of my colleagues suggested exactly that -- conversion rules to extract Aspects from a UWP but I resisted it, instead extracting Aspects from the story behind the UWP. I think, however, that you two are probably right, and that some basic information should be instantly distillable. I'll get to work.<br/><br/>As for the mailing list, I have it set so that you don't re-receive your own posts.

Interesting project and I hope to hear more from it soon (especially some finished product I can get my hands on).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
