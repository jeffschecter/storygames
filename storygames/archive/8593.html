Or, well, he played part of it.  I still think the write-up is cool, though.<br/><br/>I lined this up by posting on RPGnet a while ago, offering <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/out_there.html" rel="nofollow">Out There</a> for free to anyone who'd play it and write an account of their play by 1/26.  I figured the lost sales would be worth the press.  Well, okay, I <i>hoped</i> the lost sales would be worth the press.  With only 5 days between my deadline and the contest deadline, I knew it was a crapshoot, but I also just wanted to see what would happen.<br/><br/>No, I didn't mention in my solicitation that "get it for free" only meant saving $1.<br/><br/>So, one guy followed my instructions and emailed me to express interest.  Another 3 guys ignored my instructions and sent me private messages on RPGnet, which I didn't know to look for until a week later.  Of those, I was able to track down one, who offered to review the text, but not to play the game.  I said "no thanks".  I know "any press is good press", but a critique of something Jason wrote in 3 days just seems hopelessly beside the point.<br/><br/>So, that left me with just the first guy who'd emailed.  I didn't hear anything on the 26th, and kind of figured I'd struck out.  But no!  He responded to my next email query, and had his session written up on RPGnet less than 36 hrs later!  I wish he could have finished his game, as I really liked a lot fo the stuff he came up with.  But hey, this is way better than nothing!<br/><br/>This is the first time someone's played a game I made without me being there, and it's just a cool feeling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
