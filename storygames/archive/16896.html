I have yet to get mine, but I've been following the repercussion so far (I'm Brazilian, and there's been some talk about the game on many blogs around here). In some ways it - no surprisingly - follows the FIASCO recipe: no GMs, no prep, balanced player narrative control, framed scenes, shit hitting the fan. However, it doesn't make use of D6s, going for poker cards and chips instead.

the autor of Violentina. <br/>It's have been quite a while, I have been sneaking story games forum, mainly to learn, but I never tried to contribute because of my poor english (so I'm already apologizing for that...) =] . <br/><br/>I'm very pleased that my game showed up here, once this is one of the strongest place of inspiration for my game, and I feel the needs to share some of the informations about it, the way I can.<br/><br/>I always thought why there wasn't a game that did have try to emulate the experiences that Tarantino movies evokes, so when I started to know better the indie scene, and the possibilities that was arising with it, I give it a shot. <br/>The game is strongly influenced by Fiasco, mostly by the dynamics of a GMless game and the structure of turns, but the mechanics difere a lot, I think. <br/><br/>First there is an collaboration aspect to create the story, but tainted with a bit of a competition aspect too,  to find out in the end who is the one and only player who will tell the climax, in the last turn. <br/><br/>Like TheRoleplayer well described, it uses two decks of regular cards and some tokens, to emulate in the metagame, the feeling of being around a table filled with gangsters and mobsters. A little like the concept of "mechaphors" by Daniel Solis, how described below. <br/><br/>The mechanics that balance the authority, and gives more, or less power to intervene with this authority is given by two core rules: you can "threaten" with a hidden card, holding it like a gun (and if you win this metagame conflict, you steal the control and the turn of the player with the authority), or you can "bribe" him with a token - "Grana" (Cash) - to change some details in the narration of the Director (the player with the authority).<br/><br/>In the end, there is a final bet with the last resources, to see who is the one that will narrate the climax.<br/><br/>The characters, their relationships and the plot is constructed by the raffling of cards, where the suits, the numbers and letters will tell what is possible, according to a chart. You can tag yourself, the others players or the plot with this elements, aways describing how it fits to the story, and being rewarded if it pleases the other players. This was inspired by Wicked Age.<br/><br/>There is also a little mechanic inspired by A Penny for my Thoughts, that fits perfectly for my wishes to have some cool dialogues, like Tarantino movies does. In the beginning, each player writes three random topics, in a piece of paper, that can possibly emerge as a subject for the dialogues in the scenes. The player who uses it well, will get "suspension points" to use after the climax, like Fiasco does in the Aftermath: "this is my character doing this and that..."  <br/><br/>Well, i think this is a little summary of the basic system, and how it works. There is a better link with more stuff in the same blog that GB Steve gave us, here:  <a href="http://rolistaindependente.wordpress.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rolistaindependente.wordpress.com/downloads/</a><br/><br/>Some time ago I did a research find out the costs to make a english version, to dispose freely for download, but by now is a little expensive. I started to translate by myself, but is a tough task...<br/><br/>Perhaps with the help of my brazilian fellows I can do it more quickly.<br/><br/>I will be very happy, If I can help with any doubts that emerges from this!<br/>Thank you very much, for the interest!<br/>=]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_385345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385345/#Comment_385345" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T07:08:31+00:00" title="July 18, 2012  7:08AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eduardo - I'm not a big fan of Tarantino films but your game sounds fantastic.

I don't know how is the best way to do it, so I think I will start an open English Version Project in my blog, so that the people who wishes to help, can do it there. <br/><br/>For now, I will share below what a got so far.

Packed with unscrupulous people, who only want to get one over on you, get their fill of cash and liquor, only thinking of themselves. They want you to be the big love of their lives, to fuck you over, fuck you every way, chew you up and spit you out, bitch about you behind your back. Self interested bastards. One day your right hand man, then when they get what they want they disappear with everything in the other one . . . including, sometimes, your own right arm.<br/>Burglars &amp; bandits<br/>Prostitutes &amp; Police<br/>Tricksters &amp; Traffickers<br/>Mafiosi &amp; Minxes<br/>Addicts and down-and-outs<br/>Well, the scum<br/>Scum . . . villains?<br/>People, likewiese, who you should avoid, fight . . . Eliminate! Right? After all, in most of the RPG\u2019s that you\u2019re used to, your aim is to save the world from these filthy vermin, playing the good guy. . .<br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>If you agree, well . . . I have bad news, my friend. You are fucked! In Violentina, that saying that goes: \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em!\u201d, is the purest truth.<br/>But all is not lost. Violentina can hook you up with one of those nasty pairs mentioned above, but this book is about more than telling stories about despicable people. Violentina is sexy, seductive and really fun. So, after spending a few hours with friends walking in the shoes of those that exist on the other side of the law, you will find out why they are judged as they are. Without even dirtying your hands.<br/>After all, we\u2019re just telling stories.<br/>Stories that change us. You might not even notice it, but they change us.<br/><br/>Welcome! And don\u2019t be anxious or shy about the tone of this game. As has been well proven in comics, literature and cinema, we love stories about anti-heroes.<br/>It\u2019s time to put to work the tools we find in our hands, and tell these stories!<br/><br/>THE OLD AND NECESSARY WARNING<br/>You will find a lot of times through this whole book an informal, even a foul language, in the first person, with straight relation with the reader.<br/>This is an approach that may seem agressive, but it is a concious decision, that fits the mood of the game, and it is only a wish from the autor to reach the maximum aesthetic effect.<br/>Indie RPG\u2019s often have a strong authorship aspect, whitout the need of publisher approval, so in this one, there\u2019s no need to be diferent.<br/>This game is indicated for adults. If you are easily offended, maybe this is not the game for you.<br/>Be warned<br/><br/><b>What is an RPG?</b><br/>I will not answer this question. It is more likely that IF you decide to buy, download or obtain by any means this book, you already know the answer.<br/>But this book dropped in my hands by a aleatory reason of destiny and I don\u2019t have any clues what this means!!!<br/>Well... in this case I will do another thing. I\u2019ll tell you what I expect that this book is about. <br/>Consider this a manual to help you and your friend tell stories together.<br/>Since that we are considered human beings, we tell stories to each other. And this gave us the chance to pass from generation to generation, our culture and knowledge in a fun and ludic way. The only thing that differs us from the other animals are our capability of tell stories. We are a race of Storytellers.<br/>In the last ages of our existance, we created a device that gradually did us forget our Oral Tradition: the Writing. What is not documented, is not real. So, belongs to the imaginary world, of make-belief, of faery tales. Child thing. Right now we forgot our intrinsic capability of tell our own stories, waiting them to come from out side, from books, movies or television. Maybe even worse, we forgot the Power of changing us and make us better, that creating our own stories give us.<br/>You know what I\u2019m talking about.<br/>Our brain are conditioned to consume them, not create them.  <br/>So this book seeks a rescue of this Oral Tradition. Like every RPG does, in my point of view. The diference here is that I choose to explicit it in my game, taken it as a start point, like a personal goal as an author. I searched in this conceptual premisse a main driving force to develop my RPG. Because this is lastly, in my perspective, the raison d\u2019\xeatre of the hobbie, and the reason that makes me an enthusiastic of it.<br/>That Said, consider this book a Collective Storytelling Cookbook. <br/>The rules are there only to be sure that certain characteristics from this kind of story that this game proposes to tell, be there, and to ensure that all the players have a balanced oportunity to contribute in this process. The rules also exists to give the rhythm, leading the narrative and ensuring his climbing to the Cl\xedmax.<br/>It will be like sitting around a campfire to tell horror stories, with our faces iluminated by a lamp.<br/>Violentina is only one proposal of how we organize the play.<br/><br/>RPGS VS STORY GAMES:<br/>Role playing games is a little different from Story Games, where the goal, more than play a character, and have a system that emulates some kind of reality, is to tell stories together, having the rules as an aid for this purpose. <br/>Apart the debate If this is or isn\u2019t a RPG (perhaps by the fact that there is not a GM, etc...) it focus is in create a entertaining story with your friends, more than in its characters. Have this in mind, and your Violentina sessions will be a lot more fun.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eduardocaetano" title="eduardocaetano"><img alt="eduardocaetano" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eduardocaetano">eduardocaetano</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386012/#Comment_386012" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T22:54:39+00:00" title="July 30, 2012 10:54PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How it is a Violentina session?</b><br/>A Violentina session contemplates five Stages (Prologue, Development, Complication, Cl\xedmax and Epilogue) each one with an especific number of Turns. And each Turn also has a number os Steps.<br/>In the begining you will sit around a table with everything that is needed, and talk about how this game works. You\u2019ll write in post-its some subjects that you would like to see in the dialogues during the session. You\u2019ll draw some cards from the stack of cards previously shuffled and separeted. This cards will tell you about some important features of the Plot that you are about to create, key information like character traits, details that gives color and originality to the Plot, and the main element \u2013 that which interferes significantly in the life of all involved characters. This informations will come partly in a aleatory way, and will be yours responsability to knot the loose ends, in the proper Stage.<br/>After this Stage of refinement, you\u2019ll begin the the time for true narration. Altering in Turns, each one of you will have the chance to tell some part of this story, and also interfere in the narration of a friend, if pleases you, through mechanics created specially for this, using cards and tokens that you still have in your hands.  <br/>Before the Cl\xedmax, you\u2019ll make a pause to talk about how far this collective tale has reached, and share your expectations for its end. So, from the resources left of each player, you\u2019ll make a last bet to see with who will be the rights to narrate the Cl\xedmax!<br/>But wait! The story does not end there. The benefit of saying something about the end is not only for that one that wins the bet. For each one of the folded post-its with a dialogue subject, writen in the beggining of the game, you\u2019ll have the chance to make a sentence of an action of your desire, about you character, like an Epilogue from a book. Or the last scenes in the credits of a movie.<br/>In sum, that\u2019s all. The End. Let\u2019s play!<br/><br/><b>How to use this book?</b><br/>I recommend that at least one of the players must read through the whole book. This will ensure that if in some moment of the game appears any doubt, he will know how to clarify it, or where to find the answer in the book.<br/>You are reading the Introduction, that explains the conceptual basis of this RPG and what do you need to play.<br/>Chapter I concerns in the deep development of the concepts of the game, and its theme, describing how is it works and the details of its system in each one of its aspects, with the purpose of potentialize the game experience and justify its existence. <br/>Chapter II begins with an exemple of a Violentina Actual Play. Following, it gives variable rules, approaching secondary subjects and others possibilities of exploration of the book content. It also gives blank templates, so you can have the freedom to create upon this new possibilities. <br/>There is in the Apendix a data collection, information and graphic resources that was organized to be used as a quick consultation, with lists and tables for reference, and the therms and expressions most used.<br/><br/><b>Conventions</b><br/>When you see Bold texts, they will be referenced to an especific and important expression of the game. You can check the glossary to find a brief explanation.<br/>The Italic texts complements some arguments of the rule system in the way of actual game examples, texts from the cenario, and expressions that are normally used by gamers, also having the intention of give some colour and be in the mood of the book. <br/>When a number are described by arabic algarisms \u2013 1,2,3, etc. \u2013 it will be a mention to a game therm and its mechanics. In the other cases, the numbers will be represented by their spelling way \u2013 one, two, three, etc.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
