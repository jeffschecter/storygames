Basically, after a glossary of terms and then with instructions to have the necessary sheets in front of you, reading through the comic hopefully gives you an idea of how it plays. If anyone is interested, I'd love to hear any feedback about what I've got down for it. It still needs proofing since it's a rough, but it's the concept and outline I'm most eager to get feedback on if anyone is willing. Thanks!<br/><br/>Here is the link: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypbnc5d94tb0qwn/kickstarter-comic%20-%20new.docx" rel="nofollow">click</a><br/>The text in layout I whipped up to get an idea of panels and how much text there is: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wm2kxz1ks3cbihq/AAB-fkSlzi1fVcE1afXdRV66a" rel="nofollow">click</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432677/#Comment_432677" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T07:23:34+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  7:23AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to visualize through the formatting(text to comic panel).  <br/>I'm cool with the idea of encapsulating information in the form of comic panels.<br/>Keep it simple, with uniform comic panels.

If you have a balloon with three or more lines, either cut text or break each set of 1-2 lines off into other captions/balloons. This helps the reading flow and minimize the dreaded "wall of text," which will slow or stop your reader. Also, looking at your panel breakdown, there are some big panels with way too many total words in them (page 5 panel 2, page 7 panel 2). these need to be either edited down or spread out over several panels. A single image with too many words will make your comic seem frozen; things need to move, unless they expressly are not supposed to move.  <br/><br/>Nathan's advice about consistent panels is good, but I would mix it up a little since the context is superheroes. Start with a unified panel template, which we call a "grid." Divide each page into 3 or 4 tiers of equal height (Use the exact same measurements on each page). Then you can break up each tier as you see fit, into panels of different widths as the content demands. You could make a panorama panel that takes up an entire tier, or break a tier into any number of narrower panels to contain different story/information bits.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a Jack Kirby page using a 3-tier grid. In this case he divides the top tier into 3 panels to get across some moment-to-moment action, while the lower tiers are hitting broader story beats:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4irVuZamOhA/TQ9kQwvGnyI/AAAAAAAAE-U/2zKgkZ2qpks/s1600/scan0162.jpg"/><br/><br/>And here's one with an action panorama on the top tier:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j7RpVN3FG8E/UBbo7By6awI/AAAAAAAAGtY/6hESfEzA-ZY/s1600/Demon-1p.jpg"/><br/><br/>3 tiers is a classic American comics standard. 4 tiers will give you more density, which can help get across a lot of information if you have a tight page limit.<br/><br/>The key, as Nathan points out, is to keep the layout of the comic as simple as possible. When you establish a grid, your reader will internalize it after two pages, and will become absorbed with the grid contains (the content of your story). The more you switch up tier and panel sizes, the more difficult it is for a reader to get in a groove, and the harder it is to engage fully with the content. A really, really, really good cartoonist, who has internalized page dynamics, can go nuts with page layout in make it work. Most amateurs who try it end up with a distracting mess that may look "cool," but does more harm than good in terms of communicating with clarity. For the purposes of this tutorial comic, since part of the point is to introduce people gently to the idea of an RPG, I would stick to a classic 3-tier grid.<br/><br/>Finally, be prepared to cut, cut, cut. Your text should be pared down to its essentials, both in order to fit comfortably on the page and to keep from "outweighing" the pictures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432709/#Comment_432709" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T02:13:36+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  2:13AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really interesting and really great feedback. I'm definitely going to go in and try and distill stuff, and take into consideration the paneling, for sure. Like you said there's a lot of texts on some panels and that's slow things down.<br/><br/>I guess my question is: how bad is that? I think it makes a lot of sense when you're telling a story that you want it paced well. But here, the focus isn't on the story at all. I'm approaching it as basically a replay, or how I talk to a new player, how I get them started. It just happens to be illustrated to grab attention, and to show that you should always be thinking about what the fiction looks like. Sometimes the story will pause while work stuff out, roll and such, and then it will continue on.<br/><br/>Do you guys think that changes anything, or should the same basic concepts for a comic designed to tell a story be applied to what I'm trying to do here as well?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432710/#Comment_432710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T02:32:40+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  2:32AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the same concepts still apply: always follow the rules of your chosen medium until you're a veteran in it and know just how to break them.

I really have no experience or interaction with it other than as a reader. I'm just saying that, from my point of view at least, a lot of these rules apply to comics mainly due to pacing and conveying story. I'm trying to convey mechanics and how the game works (i.e. not trying to convey the story that the game is making, but how the game is making that story). There are definitely some fundamentals to the medium that would apply to whatever you're trying to convey, regardless of what it is because of the medium being used, for sure.<br/><br/>I'm asking the question to brainstorm, not to defend what I've come up with so far - I'm the first to admit that I don't really know what I'm doing, hence asking for other opinions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432718/#Comment_432718" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T06:51:26+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  6:51AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2014 6:54AM by Jason_Lutes.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a totally understandable question, and I do agree with James -- if you're going to use comics, use that medium's strengths. Communicating mechanics is still telling a story. Even if the subject is relatively dry, you can make it interesting by using the props of tabletop RPG and good "acting" (i.e., characters that are engaging and emotive).<br/><br/>Act I (establish): Here's what an RPG is!<br/>Act II (complicate): Here's how this particular RPG works!<br/>Act III (resolve): Here's what this particular RPG looks like in action!<br/><br/>That's just one example of how you could structure the explanation of mechanics as a story. The 3-act story structure can be a great organizational tool when you have a finite amount of space to work with.<br/><br/>12 pages is plenty of room to get your message across, you just need to be strict about how much room you allow each chunk of information. Act I is traditionally 25% of the total length, Act II is 50%, and Act III is 25%. So your 12-page count divides up nicely along those lines. Your breakdown would be:<br/><br/>Act I: pages 1-3<br/>Act II pages 4-9<br/>Act III: pages 10-12<br/><br/>Then you look at each Act. If Act I is "Here's what an RPG is!" (and I'm just using this as a for instance, not a prescription), you have 3 pages to communicate the essentials. That may seem like a lot to explain what an RPG is ("A bunch of people sit around a table and tell a story together"), but you also need to establish the setting of the story and who the characters are, so the reader has something to hold onto.<br/><br/>For this reason, I would absolutely not start with a first-person POV shot -- I would start with a small 1/3 or 1/2-tier "establishing shot" panel showing the outside of the house or apartment where the story is taking place, accompanied by a classic comic book caption that says something like, "One Tuesday night at Joe's place..." or whatever. Then in panel 2 we're inside with the players sitting around the table. I would drop the first-person POV approach because it's problematic on several levels, and too hard to pull off properly. Just make one of your characters a stand-in for the reader, someone who's never played an RPG before.<br/><br/>Anyway, looking at those 3 pages and the organizing principle of Act I, you could divide up the info like this:<br/><br/>Page 1: Establish setting and characters, newbie asks, "Well what is an RPG, anyway?"<br/>Page 2: The GM explains what an RPG is; back and forth conversation.<br/>Page 3: The conversation wraps up the basics; newbie asks, "Well what's this RPG we're going to play tonight?"<br/><br/>Most of this will be relatively staid, visually, because it's just people hanging out and talking. As long as your characters are engagingly drawn and the dialogue is crisp and tight (calling back to the "minimize text" mantra), this won't be a problem.<br/><br/>Don't fall prey to the desire to make every page and panel full of action and crazy angles. You do want to vary the visuals where possible -- showing a close up of dice, that kind of thing -- but in this case you should save the super comic book visuals for Act III, when the players are really playing Worlds in Peril and you can show their superhero characters doing cool superhero stuff. On that note, using the above as an example, one obvious way to mix up the visuals in Act I would be to have a 4-panel tier (probably at the bottom of page 1) that reads like this:<br/><br/>Panel 1<br/>GM: Different RPGs have different settings!<br/>GM: The classic is a dungeon crawl set in a fantasy world, but there are all different kinds!<br/>Image: Characters exploring a dungeon.<br/><br/>Panel 2<br/>GM: One might take place in the far future in outer space ...<br/>Image: Characters flying spaceships.<br/><br/>Panel 3<br/>GM: ... while another might be all about Cold War espionage!<br/>Image: Spy characters doing spy things.<br/><br/>Panel 4<br/>GM: Really, an RPG is only limited by your imagination!  <br/>Image: Characters in craziest RPG setting you can imagine.<br/><br/>And then the newbie asks, "If we're just going to make stuff up, what do we need dice for?" to segue into a discussion of why game mechanics exist.<br/><br/>I will try to make a draft run at your script later today if I have a moment and post some thumbnails. I feel like if I can give you a basic visual structure, it'll be relatively easy for you to fill in however you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432721/#Comment_432721" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T07:07:33+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  7:07AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, yeah. I guess I wasn't thinking it would be quite so fundamental to go so far as what an RPG is - just more of the mechanics of the game itself. Everything is told through a newbies perspective, with the GM explaining to them how they play the game. Since the game won't be going into distribution - perhaps IPR but I've had pretty bad experience with them - I feel like anyone who's going to pick up the game is on board with an RPG already and just needs the grit of the game.<br/><br/>There have been some comics told in a similar way, but I've always found them really cheesy. I didn't want shots of dice or people at the table. There's just that one establishing shot of we're playing an RPG, after that every single panel is only ever showing the fiction and how it changes based on what is said. The conversation, from a newbies perspective, with the GM explaining is entirely done through captions and the panels only change to reflect how the fiction is changing based on what is saying, or how could change based on the choices the mechanics allow. <br/><br/>At least that's the concept of course. It's super dialogue heavy and I totally want to trim that down, but my main concern after getting some of these comments is whether the concept and dialogue is sound and just needs parsing or reordering of panels if I have to start over from square one again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432722/#Comment_432722" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T07:19:13+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  7:19AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and kksimons -- what's the page size of the Worlds In Peril book?

The presence of these other 3 heroes sets up a parallel narrative that is more distracting than helpful. <br/><br/>Starting with the action and reverse-engineering a new character is a great idea, since that's such a great strength of the *World approach as well as a common storytelling strategy in comics. I like the way you go from silhouette to detailed characters a way to visually reinforce the creation process. However, I would not cut away from the story action for six pages of explanatory stuff -- I would fold that into the story itself.<br/><br/>So, for instance, Quell says she dives off the building, and the GM goes with that and says, "okay, that sounds like you've triggered a move called Defy Danger." Then the GM explains what a move is, and how the verbs apply, and asks Quell's player to choose her stats. Then Quell rolls a 10+ on the Defy Danger roll and lands on a ledge or whatever, and the story carries on. Bend the fiction of the game to incorporate the mechanics in a way that feels organic but lets you hit each point. Later on, Quell makes another move roll and gets a 7-9, and the GM explains the repercussions of that, which we see in the story, and later still she rolls 6- and we see the effect if of that roll within the story.<br/><br/>So you address each of the game mechanics within the story itself, with digressions to explain stuff, but always going back to the story. The DW refrain of "begin and end with the fiction" is a great guideline to apply here. Quell gets into a tight spot, her player says, "I'm a superhero right? What are my powers?" and the GM turns it back on her, "I don't know, what are your powers?" and explains how powers work. Then we get to see her use the powers she just created.<br/><br/>In other words, the focus of the entire 12 pages is the fiction, with digressions into mechanics as they come up within the fiction. You shoehorn them in in ways that seem natural within the unfolding fiction. Bonds get addressed when Kannon and Cerberus show up. Something happens in the fiction that triggers an origin story flashback. Etcetera. This will obviously necessitate you rearranging your existing story elements in order to accommodate the various mechanics, but your overall story will be better for it.<br/><br/>On page 1 I would just start with the action, not the table, and not the "close your eyes" stuff. Start it as if we're reading a comic book, with narrative captions that explain what needs explaining. "New York City, 2014" and "A lone figure moves across a rooftop. Who can it be?" etc. Then, in the last panel, when the character sees the laser spot, a word balloon comes in at the bottom: "What do you do?"<br/><br/>Then, top of page 2, cut to the table with the players around it talking, and digress into moves and stats, then the player rolls and you use that roll to go back into the fiction. I know you don't like the idea, but I really think you need to cut back occasionally to the table, 3-4 times total over the course of the story. As it stands, with nearly all of the text being meta-fictional "voice-over" and all of the images being from within the game fiction, the reader is actually pushed away from the story instead of being immersed in it. By occasionally returning to the table (and yes, things like shots of dice rolling), you will be telling a more honest and clear story, underlining the connection between what happens at the table and what happens in the fiction. By the same token, I would cross the line in the other direction by including sound effects and having the superheroes themselves speak some lines in word balloons.<br/><br/>Also, the voice-overs are problematic in that you have multiple speakers, often speaking over images from the fiction, will be confusing. Will each player's "voice" have a different font? A different caption color? You need to have a clear strategy for getting across who is speaking at any given time, so the reader is never in doubt if the speaker is not actually visible.<br/><br/>Don't rush the ending. The last page seems pretty crammed right now. And right now it's an illustration of the narrative confusion that those other superhero characters bring into things. You've got the meta-fictional players talking about their fictional characters, but the images are showing the entirely different fiction of the Guardian, Brain, and Outsider. The downtime explanation should be all about Quell, Kannon, and Cerberus doing their downtime things.<br/><br/>Quick-and-dirty, 3-Act restructure (ignoring the content of the story you've already solely for the sake of expedience):<br/><br/>ACT I<br/>p1: Establish, cliffhanger (start like an actual comic book).<br/>p2: Digress into moves and verbs, resolve cliffhanger, resolution of cliffhanger brings up power question.<br/>p3: Digress into powers, return to fiction with application of newly-created powers, end with Quell having created a problem with her powers (she inadvertently puts civilians at risk, etc.).<br/><br/>ACT II<br/>p4: Cerberus and Kannon come to the rescue, digress into bonds.<br/>pp5-8: Complications ensue (mystery unfolds, fights happen, etc.): includes digressions into limitations, fighting, playing to find out, advantages, more moves, etc. <br/>p9: Really bad thing happens! Kannon and Cerberus are taken out of the action (or similar); digress into damage and conditions.<br/><br/>ACT III<br/>p10: Quell has a moment to reflect or explain herself to others, origin flashback, digress into origins.<br/>p11: Quell rescues teammates or saves the day. Heroes regroup for downtime. <br/>p12: Downtime continues, suspenseful ending (end like an actual comic book).<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432730/#Comment_432730" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T09:31:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  9:31AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that makes a lot of sense to me. I was going to have the different voices in different color narrative boxes yeah, taking advantage of the color of the book, maybe with a little symbol or letter in addition the first time they show up on the page. So when they show up later do you mean they aren't played by characters? That it's just a game being played by the GM and the new player? You mention shots with players talking around the table and stuff, so wouldn't people be confused that only one person is always only ever doing something and taking part - I was hoping to show the play between the characters would show how the conversation flows and progresses and is moderated by the GM. A lot of players have problems trying to imagine how things like initiative works in *World games.<br/><br/>Maybe there's some confusion - The Brain, The Guardian and The Outsider are the player characters. The Sentinel is the Brain, The Guardian is Quell and Kannon is The Outsider. I just reference them like that in the script for the artist's sake - since he did the concept art for all the characters and knows who they are their appearance based on the brain, guardian and outsider rather than their codenames. Sorry about that, I can see that being really confusing!<br/><br/>That structure and folding the mechanics in to the story makes a lot more sense too. This is really helpful, thanks a bunch.

It's just that up until page 4 (in my version), the focus should be mostly on Quell to keep things simple.\n<blockquote>Maybe there's some confusion - The Brain, The Guardian and The Outsider are the player characters.

I would just try to have all of their appearances line up with how the fiction unfolds, instead of showing them in entirely different situations than what's happening in the main storyline. The only time I would diverge from the storyline would be to show an origin, since a flashback is such a common convention.\n<blockquote>That structure and folding the mechanics in to the story makes a lot more sense too.

But as noted above I personally would prefer all of the Quell/Kannon/Cerberus appearances to be within the chronology of the main storyline, with the exception of an origin flashback.<br/><br/>The multiple-voiceover thing is a potentially more confusing than clarifying if it's not done right. I would avoid tagging different "voices" with a letter, because that's not clear enough. Caption box color gets part way there, but it's hard to make that kind of thing "stick" in the reader's head from the get-go. Caption box color plus a different font for each character (nothing too outlandish) might be the best way to go.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432760/#Comment_432760" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T18:40:00+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  6:40PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2014 7:38PM by kksimons.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, thanks for taking the time and helping me out on this.

Finding a nugget of wisdom is much easier in Understand Comics than it is in a novel, but much easier in a board game manual than in Understanding Comics.<br/><br/>Kyle, I tried a teaching approach of interspersing example comic panels with regular text takeaways.  It's not pretty for publication or anything, but feel free to check it out and see what you think works and doesn't work.  <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html</a>  The "Complex Decisions" one is probably the most illustrative of the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432961/#Comment_432961" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-23T17:37:16+00:00" title="May 23, 2014  5:37PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think there's definitely some value in doing it that way, but I mostly wanted an example of play that would get people interested in playing and help with grokking the system. I can see interspersing instructions being really helpful, but I want to stick to what people are used to with comics for this. Cool stuff though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
