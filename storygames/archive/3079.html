But, as a newbie/amateur game designer, I'm a little unclear about how widely-accepted CR is over TR.<br/><br/>I purchased <i>DitV</i> about a year ago, and it made for some surprisingly awesome play. So, naturally, I've been obsessing over how to incorporate certain concepts (especially the general philosophy of 'players-in-control' that CR seems to espouse) into my pet design project.<br/><br/>However, I consistently run into a snag when I try to describe to my players the difference between TR and CR... which always illustrates my own ignorance of its underlying principles. Basically, I know <b>that</b> <i>DitV</i> is exceptionally fun and rewarding, for all parties... but I'm having trouble putting my finger on <b>why</b> in any practical sense.<br/><br/>Yes, I've checked out Vincent's blog for practical advice (his "cracking the safe/digging up dirt on the supervillain" analogy.) But when I try to explain it to people in practice, it breaks down: "But, I'm still rolling the same [trait/skill/attribute/etc.], right? What is the difference, exactly?"<br/><br/>Sorry for rambling... I just wanted to give as much information as possible. Any help on understanding CR (especially practical experience/advice) would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70476/#Comment_70476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T10:41:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aaron, first of all, there are a lot of reasons why Dogs is awesome, and I think you're conflating some of them and putting them under the title "Conflict Resolution."<br/><br/>CR is no more and no less than explicitly resolving what the characters want to accomplish in whole rather than in part.  Dogs does this by defining stakes and then running through lots of little tasks that "add up" to the conflict in question.<br/><br/>Players-in-control is only a part of CR insomuch as the players get to stipulate explicitly what they are trying to accomplish, and then work towards that (rather than the players saying what their characters <em>do</em> and then the GM deciding the results and consequences of actions).<br/><br/>I'm thinking, though, that this clarification isn't going to be very helpful.  What is it in Dogs that you want to replicate?  Don't use terminology; describe what it is that you like so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70478/#Comment_70478" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T10:54:12+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:54AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 10:54AM by Matt Wilson.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>edit: crossposted with teh mighty JBR.</i><br/><br/>I think the easiest way to think about CR is whether or not success advances or completes your progress toward a goal. Assuming your game isn't just wandering around a dungeon and seeing what's there, the characters most likely want to accomplish something. In TR, if you succeed, it may or may not help you in accomplishing that goal, whatever it is.<br/><br/>In many games, combat is the best example of enforced conflict resolution. You're trying to kill an orc or something, and a successful attack roll means the orc is closer to being dead. A successful tumble means you avoid being killed yourself, and maybe a +2 because now you're flanking, so you're in a better position to make the orc dead, etc. <br/><br/>Part of non-fighty conflict resolution is knowing when it's even worth making a roll in the first place. If there's nothing in the safe, why require a roll? Encourage rolls instead that get the characters closer to what they want.<br/><br/>Part of it is getting the players out of the Zork mindset, where you're compelled to interact with every minute thing in the environment. We've been trained, many of us, to do just that.<br/><br/>Another part is playing to the characters' abilities. If the character has +100 safecracking, put something rewarding in the safe. If the character has +80 driving, make sure a successful driving roll allows them to catch the escaping bad guy or force the bad guy to drop the loot or something cool.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70479/#Comment_70479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T10:56:43+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm by no means a master of this, but here's my take on the difference.<br/><br/>The difference is in what the character is doing and why he's doing it.<br/><br/>Task resolution will determine if he opens the safe.  That's it.  It doesn't matter if the character gets what he wants out of the safe, finds nothing in the safe or the safe blows up on him.  All we know is that he got it open.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution focuses on why he wants to open the safe.  Maybe he's looking for "dirt".  To look at it simply, if the character succeeds, he finds the "dirt" regardless of whether or not it was supposed to be there or even has any business being there.  Of course, maybe he finds the "dirt" under the safe or behind it or somewhere else in the office.  He may not even get the safe open, but he'll still get the thing "why" he was there.<br/><br/>The tricky part is that there can be, and often is, some overlap.  If the character really just wants that safe to be open for no apparent reason, regardless of what's inside or not or what effect it might have on the story, then the roll is both TR _AND_ CR.  The "what" and the "why" are the same.<br/><br/>As an excersise, you might ask "why" of a proposed action.  "I want to open the safe" (TR?)  "Why?"  "To get what's inside." (A little CR?)  "Why?"  "I'm hoping to find evidence indicting Mr. Bad." (CR?)  "Why?"  "So I can get him sent to jail." (CR, but kind of outside the scope of the scene?)<br/><br/>The reason I put the question marks is that until you know what the player's "why" is, the roll can be both CR and TR.  Plus how much you can accomplish with one roll varies by game and play group, though I think a decent rule of thumb is to consider if the "why" can be accomplish in that one scene.<br/><br/>I hope that's of some use.  I think I may have even cleared it up for myself a little <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70481/#Comment_70481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T11:06:54+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 11:06AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 11:12AM by Aaron_S.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what turns me on about <i>DitV</i>:\n<ul>\n<li>Player-driven stories, without GM-determined outcomes.</li>\n<li>Having towns (adventures) that are pregnant with conflict, so there's pretty much always something at stake.</li>\n<li>Asking the players, "Why?

However, this is my current difficulty: I'm currently running present-day <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> (BRP), and trying to do just that... but in practice, 'getting to the point' of a conflict (asking "Why" and "What's at stake") doesn't seem to affect the process or outcome.

Using the basic CoC resolution, you can get a whole bunch of "speeding up" of things done with that method. Not only do you avoid unnecessary rolls, but you can start to achieve an effect similar to Result Quality of rolls by clear stake-setting.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Library Use skill check stakes:<br/>Critical Success: Get the info in d3 hours<br/>Pass: Get all of the possible info in one day of research<br/>Fail: Get all info, but it takes d3 days.<br/>Horrible failure: As fail, and the bad guys notice the investigators have been showing an unhealthy interest.<br/><br/>In all cases, the investigators get the info. It's a matter of how much is lost in resources (time) and how much risk is involved .<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, whether or not that qualifies as CR, I dunno, but it definitely improves the thing, regardless.<br/><br/>Where you might run into issues with CoC is the specific-ness of the skills. A lump-skill might work better with a stakes style set-up than the more diverse CoC skills. For example, imagine a character with Scientific Investigation 60%, rather than a bundle of different levels of science skills and how that would work.<br/><br/>The scope of the stakes is something that is important, as mentioned above. The style of game is also going to impact the stakes as well. As mentioned in a different thread on the topic of CoC, very different sorts of stakes are appropriate in a game where the players are collectively creating a mystery as opposed to a game where there is a pre-set mystery to be resolved. ( The Until We Sink game is actually a pretty good example of the first type of game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
