I'd love to hear about them!

I recommend you start a new thread and post some examples.)</blockquote>\nHere are the rules of engagement for this discussion!<br/><br/>* The best practices suggested must stick with the general form of a traditional RPG (distinct player and GM roles, use of task resolution mechanics.)<br/>* No discussion of specific games, although type of mechanics (fate points, madness points, and the like) is allowed.<br/>* Make sure your advice doesn't amount to "making trad games more like [this or that story game]"<br/>* Your advice must be useful for traditional RPGs as a whole, or at least traditional RPGs within a single genre (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, etc.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337414/#Comment_337414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T07:12:48+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  7:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2011 7:13AM by AusJeb.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prep time is better spent on NPCs than on encounters and on NPC backgrounds, relationships, and motivations rather than stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337416/#Comment_337416" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T07:34:12+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  7:34AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To king things off, I'll use a comment from Paul T. in another thread, and then share my take on it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>My own experience growing up with gamers was that there was a huge cult of "GM Mystery". It was so, so important for the Mighty GM to maintain an air of mystery. You must smile knowingly, look mysteriously at the players, and roll dice behind your screen while looking through your notes. The GM must tell the players that "You can do anything!" and then subsequently make sure that the game ends up in scene 25 with the Duke impaled on a candlestick at precisely twenty minutes past eight. Or else you're a bad GM.</blockquote>\nHere's the thing: I think a lot of the fun of being a traditional GM is creating / depicting a world or a sequence of events. And I also think this is what's expected of the GM, as in trad games he's the interface between the players and the game world - he's their eyes, ears, intuition, etc. That means he needs to create enough details to make the world vivid. And on top of this, he is traditionally responsible for the cohesiveness of the game world, so he needs to make sure everything makes sense.<br/><br/>These aspects definitely create a tension between the idea that players can do anything and the role of the GM. I think the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> trap a GM can fall into is design a great set piece for his game. Even if that set piece is designed from the best of intentions ("man, this will blow the players mind, this is exactly the kind of scenes they love!"), the fact that effort went into it will lead the GM to try and set up a path to that scene. He'll want that path to be appealing so the players don't feel forced into it, so he'll put effort into <i>that</i>, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>It's really really hard to reconcile player freedom and GM... craftmanship, maybe?<br/><br/>Eventually, through discussions during the pre-Forge boom, I ended up to a solution to this. I honestly can't tell if somebody suggested it to me outright, or if I pieced it together.<br/><br/>This sounds contradictory, but nowadays, I plan scenarios by plotting out exactly what happens if the player characters don't do anything. Doing it like this makes it clear that they'll derail whatever I come up with, so I put as much effort into it as I'm willing to see destroyed. The other advantage is that the players aren't the event triggers. That cool subplot I designed, if the players don't go into it, it'll happen in the gameworld nonetheless, and provide some color and a sense that this is a living world where stuff happens. And on top of this, I find it's way more fun to GM because in my own way, I get to roleplay more. If my plot is about the Archduke of Death bringing in a cart full of hero bones to raise generals for his undead army and the PCs toss the cart into the river, I now need to get in the Archduke of Death's head and ask myself "What do I do now to reach my goals?".  <br/><br/>So yeah, I've used this for years and it works wonders. It leaves the PCs with a true freedom to do anything the rules permit, but allows me to have that creative fun and to portray a game world that's rich and immersive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337418/#Comment_337418" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T07:43:12+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  7:43AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AusJeb</cite>Prep time is better spent on NPCs than on encounters</blockquote>\nInteresting - in my experience, they tend to be equally important.

The GM should be able to explain the range of character types allowable for the adventure at hand.<br/><br/>As GM, plan for the initial adventure to take place over two play sessions. Be prepared for it to close up in one session, or to go slightly over and end up as three sessions.<br/><br/>If it does go to three sessions, have some ideas in mind for closing up the adventure during the third session.<br/><br/>When ending the adventure, it is perfectly fine if not all threads that have developed during play are neatly sewn up, and perhaps even desirable. However, there should be some sense of closure on the major points of the adventure.<br/><br/><i>Cliches and tropes are your best tools for the first adventure</i><br/>There is something that made this particular game and system and genre exciting to you, so make sure at least one or two of those elements make it into the very first adventure. The first adventure is <b>not</b>a time for subtlety. Make sure those elements of interest to you make it into the adventure and make an early appearance.<br/><br/>Don't try to cram everything in, however. Just one or two elements, when embroidered upon, can make for an exciting adventure.<br/><br/><i>Feedback between the sessions</i><br/>Don't even bother to try to get useful feedback from players immediately after a session of gameplay ends, and certainly not in the same evening. Let folks stew on it a bit. Seek feedback casually, and no sooner than the following day. Electronic communication is useful for this. Don't necessarily couch it in terms of seeking feedback, but in more general terms about the game, characters, and setting.<br/><br/>Also use time between sessions to answer any mechanical or style questions players might have about the game. Be fairly liberal about sharing information about the setting and mechanics, including things that their characters might not know ( although avoid giving away GM secrets).<br/><br/>Feedback after the final ( second or third session)<br/>After the adventure wraps up, wait a day or two, then seek more feedback. Find out if players wish to continue with their characters or make new ones. If they're into it, even allow dead characters to make a come back, working out the retcon or off screen miraculous rescue as necessary. On the opposite end of things, discuss with players whether they want to change characters entirely.<br/><br/>Use this downtime to lend books as necessary to the most interested players, and let them delve into both the mechanics and the setting. Try to get conversations going between yourself and the players, and between the players themselves, about what they're digging about the setting and types of adventures that take place there.<br/><br/>Finally, with all of this info in hand, decide if you have enough interest to get a solid group together to play another adventure in the same setting, and decide what form this will take.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing wrong with going with a slightly different combination of players or planning an adventure that focusses on entirely different aspects of the setting and playstyle from the original Test Run One-shot.<br/><br/>There's also absolutely nothing wrong with discovering that, for the particular group in question, this specific game+mechanics+style+focus really isn't their collective cuppa tea.<br/><br/><i>Say No to Open Ended Campaigns! (at least initially)</i><br/>Assuming you have a relatively interested core group of players that are communicating their interests to you and to one another, you may well decide that you've got the makings for a Big Ol' Open Ended Campaign or even an Epic Storyline Campaign.<br/><br/>You'll probably be very excited, and as GM, begin plotting a whole bunch of stuff up. Even as a Sandbox Loing GM, you'll likely begin planning all kinds of cool locations and NPCs.<br/><br/><b>Don't</b>. No, for realz, <i>Don't Do it</i>. <br/><br/>A running campaign is something that best develops organically, and with heavy player input (whether or not they realize they're giving input).<br/><br/>Plan only one adventure set up at a time, and wait to see which direction players are going to take with things. Your second adventure should follow the same basic format as your first, and again emphasisze cliches and tropes, albeit different ones than the first.<br/><br/>You'll likely get some rather more active players who rapidly follow their own sense of fun, and who show up regularly and contribute ideas about what makes the game fun for them outside of game sessions.<br/><br/>Feel no remorse in following their lead and showing them GM love by incorporating their idea and directions in play, even if it means showing less spotlight (in terms of planning game stuff) on less active players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337427/#Comment_337427" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T09:16:55+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  9:16AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            kbob, I agree with everything EXCEPT that you shouldn't plan for a Big Long Campaign up front. I absolutely think you should. It's just a different sort of planning.<br/><br/>* Identify the big, overarching conditions of the game world that will lend the big campaign identity. The Dark Powers rule the plane of Ravenloft. Al Amarja is a real strange place. You need to make these conditions clear to the players as campaign conditions, not as things that you or they will change. They have to be able to count on some form of continuity in order to feel like something under their feet is real.<br/><br/>* Identify the social movements and pressures that will exert on the party. Nobility distrusts magic-users.  Monsters want to ear humans.  Humans hate mutants. Gangsters run Gotham City.  Like fronts on a battlefield (I'm not an expert on AW fronts, so don't confuse them with what I'm talking about, but I like the terminology), there will be specific events, pushes, withdrawals, victories and losses, but no single event is going to wipe out that pressure, even to change its direction or mediate its power will take a very considerable period.<br/><br/>* Create a cohesive concept for who the player characters are and a mandate that takes them in front of the pressures you've designed. Adventurers want monsters' gold. You've got to clean up the town. The theater is counting on you.  Importantly, if the players choose to move out of that mandate (they burn down the theater for the insurance money needed to pay off the Dementlieu Large-Eyed Orphan's Home's tax burden), you need to develop enough idea of the setting (including those pressures listed above) that you can get them into another mode of action that will similarly bring them into conflict again.<br/><br/>A lot of Big Campaign problems can be solved by:<br/><br/>* identifying that you are doing a Big Campaign<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>* making sure the material you prepare is grounded in a way that a short campaign doesn't require.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337461/#Comment_337461" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T16:18:37+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  4:18PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2011 4:41PM by Wordman.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Combat encounters should have something else going on than "just kill those other guys". Can you stop the idol from falling into the lava while fighting the elementals? Can you get through the orcs to the other side of the bridge before the evil horde can unleash the trolls? Can you get through the minions before the necromancer completes the ritual? Can you stay on only the black squares while fighting the wraiths?<br/><br/>Tailor this "something else" to whatever the game you are playing does well, especially paying attention to capabilities of the PC. For example, D&amp;D 4E concerns itself a lot with positioning (pushing and pulling on the grid map) so something like the "black squares" notion from above works particularly well at delivering fun in that rule set, particularly if the PCs have a lot of those kind of powers. Something like Pathfinder has a lot of "utility spells" that can be used in ways not originally intended to solve problems (and tends to attract players that like doing this), so playing to that notion may make for memorable encounters.

Off the top of my mind, there's two things I can think off that I've found really helpful. The first is to hold a Session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%230&amp;Mode=like">#0</a> where that kind of stuff is discussed in advance. When everyone is in tune about the general tone the game should have, I think a lot of these situations stop happening. The second is to agree on what to do in case of disagreements. Arguing 'round the table will kill a game dead, so it's important that the group decides on how a quick call is made, and how the issue will be brought up again afterwards. For instance, a group could agree that the GM gets to decide, or that it's left to a silent vote ... and that the issue is going to be discussed again at the end of the session. The important thing for this to work, for me, is for everyone to be aware that the quick call is a one time deal. The final decision on that question being brought up will be the decision made during the discussion... the quick call is meant to keep the game going.<br/><br/>Either way, I think this issue underlines a lot that traditional RPGs are reliant upon trust. The GM and the players (and the players among themselves) need to trust each other, and the absence of that trust severely limits any kind of awesomeness that might have emerged.<br/><br/>For me, this is very much a feature (and not a bug.) But it's important to be aware of it, and to think about how to protect trust and build it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

We usually hand out some XP to the player that does the recap.<br/><br/>Things can get very interesting if a player that missed last session and only has heard about it from the other players picks up the glove and does the recap. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337585/#Comment_337585" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T05:58:12+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  5:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>We usually hand out some XP to the player that does the recap.</blockquote>So do we.

So your question really can only be answered by group by campaign. <br/><br/>I use what I call Campaign Levers and at the start of a campaign, I pick several that I think will be relevant for the type of game we are going to play.  A lever will have two extremes, with 1 at the left and 10 at the right, representing the far ends of each position.  Then I go through them one by one with the group and we decide on where along the gradient we want the campaign to take place for each lever.  A classic level is "Character Death" with something like "Let the dice fall where they may" on the far left and "Characters are protected protagonists" on the right.  So that way, when it does come up, everybody knows what to expect.<br/><br/>I am of the mind more and more that the Session 0 is one of the crucial best practices of a good campaign.  It's like having a discussion about all the potential pitfalls of a campaign, before they happen instead of after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337663/#Comment_337663" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T13:57:11+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  1:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite> The decision to move on is about sublimating your own ego for the betterment of the group.

Why do you think so?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AusJeb</cite>...and on NPC backgrounds, relationships, and motivations rather than stats.</blockquote>\nDon't you think it depends, though? If it's an NPC you'll have a mechanical conflict with, don't you think it's better to make him / her mechanically interesting?<br/><br/>This one actually depends on how flexible is the GM and how resorceful are the players, but in my experience -being a too flexible GM with players that just love to send the campaign in any direction they please- I found a way to keep the campaign with coherence.<br/><br/>Yes to spend more time on NPCs, since if players manage to derail the campaign, they can miss a location for an encounter, but an NPC can follow or even ambush them anywhere. Of course, if you're good placing encounters anywhere or getting PCs to where they need to be (I mean, not by plain railroading but by giving their characters a good motivation), then there's no need to prefer one over the other.<br/><br/>Making full stats for a NPC can take a lot of time. Well, at least for me it's easier to come up with an story and some background than to fill a full character sheet. Perhaps you can use a character creator sofware and make it quicker, but in the end what you actually need is the strategy or trick that character will pull against the PCs and a motive, so when using it you can just roll and assign stats in game (yeah, I'm that lazy but the sessions go quite well, the game doesn't slow down and the players have no complains about it)<br/><br/>On top of that, it's quite easy to care too much about characters/monsters that you spend too much time creating. You want them to go out and do their trick... and suddenly players kill them too early or avoid them somehow. It happens the same when yo take too much time with an encounter, it becomes a piece of literature you don't want the players to miss and so you end up forcing them to find them and interact with it in the way <i>you </i>want.<br/><br/>So the best way to avoid taking too much care about the world you create is spending the minimal effort to create it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337666/#Comment_337666" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T14:07:44+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  2:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the solution of working it out before hand.

Then I use a random generator to create a bunch of NPCs (mostly their backgrounds, motivations and personality) and tie them to the organizations. It's perfect for keeping coherence, as you will see soon. Now you can insert a major event outside the reach of those organizations and predict how they will react. Voil\xe1, now you have a campaign that players can't derail and you don't need to railroad, since they are the ones that will be guiding it and you can keep organizations (or part of them) reacting, always out of reach and finding new ways to pursue their objectives. And mess with the PCs.<br/><br/>I prefer using organizations rather than individuals, since individual plans can be foiled easily with a few good rolls (and poor rolls for that NPC) or brilliant tactics or poor planing. Or a lucky headshot in most systems. That way if an important NPC dies, it can easily be replaced by another with a similar goal but different means. That way you can recycle the PC's hate and reincarnate their nemesis in a new form without using too much magic nor technology (leave that for the actual big event)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337702/#Comment_337702" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T19:02:24+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  7:02PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Well if we're following best practices, then all of these potentialities should be discussed ahead of time and agreed upon by the group.

Some of the things that I\u2019ve used are a <a href="http://www.mindware.com/p/Q-bitz/44002" rel="nofollow">dice game</a> to simulate programming a computer, assembling a small jigsaw puzzle within a time limit to represent defusing a bomb, and quizzing the players about nursery rhymes (\u201cWhat is Wednesday\u2019s child full of?\u201d) as a proxy for their magic-studying characters\u2019 being tested on their knowledge of magic.<br/><br/>The proxy activity must be something that every person has a reasonable chance of succeeding at. For example, I wouldn\u2019t make a player win a chess game for his character to succeed at something, because many people aren\u2019t good at chess.<br/><br/><b>Props are fun.</b> When I ran <i>Torg</i>, I used to use a lot of props. The prop was only as elaborate as its purpose required. Simple hand-outs, like newspaper articles. Maybe hats or goggles for the players. A lab coat for an NPC. Clues they could find. A cool book. Mock-ups of devices they can operate. In one adventure, when the players told me they were going to search an office, I produced a desk drawer full of stuff (prepared ahead of time) and said, \u201cHave at it.\u201d<br/><br/>When not to do this: (1) If there\u2019s even a remote chance that it would compromise safety. For example, I\u2019ll never use a prop made of glass. (2) If the adventure is pressed for time, because physical interaction with props is always slower than just saying what happens. (3) Recommended, but not a fast rule: for horror stories. Players\u2019 imaginations tend to be scarier than tangible items.<br/><br/><b>Never leave to chance that which <i>must</i> happen.</b> Before you scream \u201cRailroading!\u201d consider this: Sometimes the premise of an adventure is the undoing of a bad thing, rather than preventing the bad thing from happening. To use a movie example, <i>The Italian Job</i> opens with a double-cross. Had the protagonists thwarted the double-cross, there\u2019d be no movie.<br/><br/>If you want to have The Bad Thing played out, do it early in the adventure, and tell the players up front that it\u2019s the Maguffin and they can\u2019t stop it. Reward them in-game with experience points or fate/style/plot points for this fiat. And if they (or you) want to play out their trying to stop The Bad Thing, reward them even more for making the scene exciting -- as if they didn\u2019t know the conclusion was foregone -- and give them the freedom to come up with explanations for why their attempts fail.<br/><br/><b>The same, with sprinkles.</b> In action-oriented game systems with fate/style/plot points, I warn the players ahead of time that one of the ways they\u2019ll earn said points starts with my saying, \u201cTake a point for what\u2019s about to happen to your character.\u201d Whatever I say next cannot be prevented. I use this technique sparingly to tell a player that his character just sprang a trap, or was surprised by the villain, or got knocked out, or whatever. I\u2019ve never had players complain about this after they see it in action.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jkubli" title="jkubli"><img alt="jkubli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jkubli">jkubli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340317/#Comment_340317" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T08:40:04+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  8:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a pretty traditional GM of pretty traditional games, but here are an outline of my personal guidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave 3+ locations for each adventure. Describe the scene quickly but economically, and make sure that the location matters to the events of the scene. A social encounter, a combat encounter, a skill-based puzzle encounter, should all play out differently on a sunny beach at noon, or in a dank catacomb, or in rush hour traffic, or in an alien jungle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree about planning for the worst re: PCs failing to act. In my recent adventure design, each scene has a clearly marked 'What Needs to Happen' section, which is usually pretty simple and straightforward; go from A to B to C. Make sure the PCs know the transition to the next scene occurs when they're done meeting these objectives. When planning a skill check that advances plot, I plan for 'success', 'failure', and 'dithering/waffling', in case they don't think to make the check. Success provides minor rewards, failure may give temporary penalties, but somehow the show must go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach conflict scene must have multiple methods of resolution. Many gamers enjoy combat a lot, so I try to have the potential for combat in each scene, but make sure there are other options; stealth, social encounters, information gathering, etc. Reward the PCs for completing the scene, not on which option they chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave an A plot and a B plot; the A plot is generally some terrible event that must be stopped, or location that must be explored, while the B plot should involve NPCs and their relationships, their inner struggles, some human interest situation. The B Plot can involve the potential for PC romance, but romance, like combat, is only an option, not a necessity. The B Plot can also involve exposition on the setting. The A Plot involves a dramatic, maybe traumatic situation, the B Plot is subtler but just as important, for different reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe antagonists should always have believable motives, and the PCs should be aware of the antagonists' real, understandable motives. This doesn't have to be played cheesy and schmaltzy, with a "Join me!" scene or a "I blame society" speech, but it gives the conflict depth and purpose to realize that hey, the "bad guys" (if they truly are bad) are people, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever let the action slow down. If the PCs are bogged down in details meaningless to the scene, skip ahead. But if the PCs are lingering over details that serve the plot somehow, even if they aren't the details you envisioned they'd care about, linger. Improvise more for them to do. Give them what they want, just not in the way that they expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the start of each session, recap the action so far. At the end of every session, summarize what happened and explain the goals for the next session, before handing out any rewards. Always.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340320/#Comment_340320" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T09:17:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  9:17AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best advice ever<br/>Say yes, or roll the dice. <br/>I mean really it has been said time and time again, but actually doing seems to be so hard for many Traditional GM's. The players are presented with a problem, and they have an idea on how to fix it. So, maybe it was not the solution that you were thinking of. Maybe they do not even understand the problem and are thus going about it completely wrong, either explain it again or change it to what they think. When they give you their ideas either say yes that is it. If you do not think it will work that way let the dice decide for you. <br/><br/>What do you think? <br/>Do not be afraid to stop and just ask a player what they think about this situation, or about what is going on. You will learn something about what they are seeing, and it will give you ideas about what your next step will be. It will also make the actually stop and actually think for a second, which will often get them to be more proactive and less reactive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340697/#Comment_340697" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-27T05:41:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2011  5:41AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When in doubt, roll the dice.
