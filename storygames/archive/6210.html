Anyone volunteer to keep the topic alive in another thread?</blockquote>\nI've actually been keenly interested in this topic for a while, and I've been meaning to start a thread simply to hear other's opinions on the issue.  So here it is.  This is less about designing for mainstream players (an issue which is pretty loaded on it's own), and more about wanting to hear folks' experiences and intuitions with using playing cards in games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Maybe try out a few card-based games (Contenders, Dust Devils, especially Spione) and see some of the ways they are being used. I like them for all the reasons you describe. I know people who dislike them because they have very specific connotations - I guess if you play poker a lot, it's hard to look at a deck of cards and think "gritty spy thriller" and not "Texas hold 'em".</blockquote>\nThat someone is me- Jason and I have been going around and around about this lately, because he loves designing games that use playing cards and I think they carry strong connotations of their own which make their applicability somewhat limited.  I think they're great for <i>Dust Devils</i>, for example, because the pre-set expectations of playing cards (poker, gambling, cheating, etc.) reinforce the setting and tone of a Western story.  I haven't played <i>Contenders</i> or <i>Spione</i>, but I have played <i>Drowning &amp; Falling</i> and other smaller games using cards.  My experience has always been that the hundred-or-so years of cultural baggage attached to the cards contradicts the themes of those games, or at least my associations about them.  For example, D&amp;F is essentially a dungeon-crawler, so I expect dice.  That clash of expectations is distracting to me, creating a barrier for me getting into the game initially.<br/><br/>I recognize that much of this is in my own head- these are my associations, my expectations that are getting in the way of my game experience.  I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in that, however, and unless it's the intention of the game designer to create that discordance, it seems disruptive.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I'm not saying you're wrong at all, Jason. My point was simply to recognize that there are a couple of different groups in there with different expectations.<br/><br/>As an example, I was talking to a friend about Universalis, and got to the bit about coins. Jumping ahead, she immediately asked if the goal was to win all of the coins. I wa a little at a loss, but it was a fairly reasonable question, as this is a common goal of games played with coins.<br/><br/>Likewise, in a game played with cards, people often hold a hand of cards...</blockquote>\nI thought this was a good example of what I'm talking about- players bring a set of deep, cultural associations to the table any time they play a game.  If they've ever played an RPG before (or heard of one), they'll probably look for dice and character sheets.  If there's a board, they'll expect to have a representative token they can move around.  If it's a card game, they'll want to pick up and look at their cards as a hand, and if they're playing cards, they'll probably start matching Poker hands.  As a designer, do you want to design your game to run with the grain of those expectations or to cut across them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137825/#Comment_137825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T08:02:54+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  8:02AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A potential solution is to use a tarot deck, removing the Major Arcana and the Pages (essentially, spare jacks) to bring the deck size back down to 52.

Perhaps it's about symbols and imagery- while a die may have some connotations based on it's shape, its essentially a number generator.

It's right up there with keeping Sorensen locked in my basement, which explains why he only posts anymore when I let him. (Note to self: Need to get some more lotion; also dogfood and a new basket.)<br/><br/>I realize that people get, um, hung up on cards for many of the reasons your stating (and some other ones). I know people in my own group who have similar reactions. <br/><br/>But, with no slight meant, I just can't worry about it. If I know going in that some people are going to get hung up on cards, even though I think they are the best tool for the game I want to make (or play)? Then those people lose out.  <br/><br/>Now, certainly, this may mean they aren't actually the best tool from, say, a sales perspective or something. <br/><br/>But, as you say: \n<blockquote>all of which carry potential meaning to players that you might not intend.</blockquote>\nHoly crap there is an endless abyss of "potential meaning" things that people who receive my games will bring in. If I let that worry me too much, I'd lose my mind and make crummy games.

Magic tricks, for instance, have gotten folks used to a variety of "pick one," whether looking at it or not, behaviors. War is a fundamental "pick and play and compare" game that everyone knows on some level. Even poker has variations with visible cards, unheld hands, and shared cards (Stud and Hold'em, respectively). Heck, even building them up into a teetering stack is a common occurrence, as are plus-one/minus-one, alternating colors, etc (Solitaire).<br/><br/>I mean... I would think that, for someone to argue Steve's side, he or she would have to come up with an example of card use or interaction which does not yet exist in a common game. (I just tried, and it's hard!)<br/><br/>In the end, what's a standard playing card deck? A d13 which simultaneously "rolls" a d4 each draw... but which can only yield four cards of any given value without reshuffling (or multiple decks) or thirteen of any given suit. So if a resolution system is served by this direct coupling of a d13 and d4, and the inverse relationship of availability, then a deck of cards is a perfect randomizer. Of course, they also have uses as a changeable game board:<br/><a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Gnostica/GnosticaRules.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Gnostica/GnosticaRules.html</a><br/><br/>Therefore, I'd take the exact opposite side from Steve: barring some radical new way to use the cards in play, the use of playing cards as a systemic element in an RPG should make for <i>less</i> of a barrier to entry, for new- or non-gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137877/#Comment_137877" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:32:17+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2008 10:33AM by Marhault.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible that I agree with both Matt and Steve about this?<br/><br/>No method of fortune is without its own connotations.

Sometimes you have to ignore those connotations because the practical applications are better suited than anything else for what you need, when that happens you encounter the barrier that Steve describes.<br/><br/>The closest thing to truly color-neutral fortune you can have is customized objects, like Ganakagok or Legends of Alyria.

Here they don't just flavour the experience of playing the game. The Tarot cards are used to give power cards that match best with abilities on your character sheet, encouraging you to bank those cards or keep them in your hand. That's a nice tactic brought into play (games with dice rarely have you keeping a rolled result, for instance).<br/><br/>Ashok Desai's Fearmonger use regular cards but also does that "keeping your cards" thing that Swansong does. It's a kind of resource management. Fearmonger uses it to help with the tension of rural horror (Deliverance, Children of the Corn, Wicker Man are what leap to my mind when thinking of it).<br/><br/>Finally, Iain McAllister's Mob Justice uses a regular deck and an almost-poker mechanic to introduce raising and _bluffing_ (on behalf of the GM and players).

And to it I would add 6 sided dice. "Gaming" for me has involved cards far longer than (polyhedral) dice has. I did not grow up playing dice based rpgs, but we played card games and 6 sided dice games. It's more natural for me to incorporate 6 sided dice and cards in role playing. Cards are versatile. You can play children's games, simple games of chance (like war) that have no strategy, and highly competitive "grown up games" full of strategy.<br/><br/>But I also grew up telling stories between my friends and relatives. I find it easier to combine the familiar cards and D6's than to mess with polyhedrals.  Easier, but polyhedrals are not impossible. They're exotic to me.<br/><br/>In that sense, polyhedral dice have an air of elitism. They don't feel natural. Lots of families tell stories and play card games, even if they've never played rpg's, D&amp;D, etc. Cards are ubiquitous, as are D6's. Polyhedrals require a teensy bit more effort to acquire. So I think of a family or group of friends sitting around wondering what to do for the evening. Let's play PTA! Cool! I have a deck of cards, we can use pennies and nickels for poker chips. And if you must go out to get more equipment it's probably wine and snacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137935/#Comment_137935" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T12:28:47+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 12:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I need to recognize that part of my agenda on this is business-oriented, thinking about how we (Bully Pulpit) put out games.

Even i, if i see a set of two red and white acrilic d6s, i\xb4ll think first of casino craps than rpgs.</blockquote>\nMy understanding (I wasn't around then either) was that such dice were difficult if not impossible to find at the time D&amp;D was released, and you were picking chits out of a box instead. Now they're a natural part of the universe to all of us gaming geeks, but that wasn't always the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138038/#Comment_138038" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T19:00:40+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:00PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna sock you, Nate! <br/><br/>I think simple is best, so you've got a nice randomizer built in with various emergent properties layered on top.

My issue is not about doing something fundamentally new with cards, it's about the inherent meaning attached to sets of playing cards that might have nothing to do with a given RPG.  For some folks (apparently not as many here) those associations jump to mind immediately when looking at the cards.  "Ooh, look! I've got three tens and two sevens- Full House!"  I'm just suggesting that if your game doesn't have anything to do with full houses, that can get in the way.<br/><br/>Some folks here have rightly identified this as a "color" issue- if the themes or concepts of your game don't match up with those folks might associate with playing cards (Spy stories, gangsters, Westerns, Alice in Wonderland) there's a dissonance that makes it harder to get into the game.<br/><br/>But hey, it's just a thing.  I appreciate everybody's input because it's really helped me shape my thinking about the problem.

I think they're great for<i>Dust Devils</i>, for example, because the pre-set expectations of playing cards (poker, gambling, cheating, etc.) reinforce the setting and tone of a Western story.  I haven't played<i>Contenders</i>or<i>Spione</i>, but I have played<i>Drowning &amp; Falling</i>and other smaller games using cards.  My experience has always been that the hundred-or-so years of cultural baggage attached to the cards contradicts the themes of those games, or at least my associations about them.  For example, D&amp;F is essentially a dungeon-crawler, so I expect dice.  That clash of expectations is distracting to me, creating a barrier for me getting into the game initially.?<br/><br/>Talking about Spione, the use of cards in that game, with all their connotations, don't contradict the them of the game at all. There is a cultural connotation of "cards/read your destiny" and "card/luck get your way or not" that is very appropriate to the helplessness of the characters against the powerful, amoral and secret organizations that play with their life.<br/><br/>About the "luck" factor, I think that dice are more like "I will try to get lucky this time" and cards  are more like "let's find if luck is with me", dice are more "try" and cards are more "let's find out", it it does make sense...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138094/#Comment_138094" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T06:28:10+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  6:28AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I don\u2019t get is the <i>cards = poker</i> association.

From the top of my head, with regular card: rummy, gin rummy, solitaire, blackjack, belote, whist, suit whist, liar\u2019s poker, and a bunch of game of which I don\u2019t know the English name: bataille corse ("corsican war"), nain jaune ("yellow dwarf") (uses cards and a board and betting tokens), manille, couyon ("coward" or "idiot" in Walloon).<br/><br/>And I am not a card player.<br/><br/>There are many mainstream games that use custom cards, eg Monopoly, Uno, Mille Bornes.<br/><br/>And there are quite a number of gamer-culture card games: for example Once Upon a Time, Brawl!, Magic, Lord of the fries\u2026<br/><br/>There are association with cards, but they are much, much wider than poker. Cards = games. (And divination, yes). Just like dice. I don\u2019t know the English names of all these games, but from the top of my head: 421, Yahtzee, dudo (liar\u2019s dice?), pig, craps, cul de chouette (\u201cowl\u2019s bottom\u201d), 10000, and many, many mainstream boardgames like Monopoly.<br/><br/>The only difference I see is that rpg used almost only dice up till now.

(Again, ZERO data other than me talking to people, seeing postings for casual tournaments, etc.). In my area, 5-point Pitch is popular. It's my favorite game. However, 10-point Pitch, 4 Point pitch and so on vary in popularity even within my state. Euchre? Not so much. I don't know anyone who plays it (I'm sure people in my area do, I just dont' know them.) I used to know lots of people in college who did, and many of them were from the northern Midwest and Illinois. Oh! One last bit -- Bridge clubs seem to be almost universal. And often old ladies playing, but not exclusively. My dad plays 5-point pitch in a club every month. My mother? She plays either Bridge or Bunco (Bunco is a dice game that's also been very popular across the area, maybe the US, I dunno. It tends to be played by social clubs for women.)<br/><br/>Another interesting observation: GenCon hosts Texas Hold 'Em tournaments in some capacity.

Bear in mind that I want to design games that non-rpg'ers and rpg'ers alike would enjoy together, or that a non-rpg'er would pick up and get excited to play. Existing associations in cards are useful design-wise for me. One of the things I think turns people off to trying rpgs, besides the false assumption that they're all about wizards and elves, is that there there's extra stuff you need that you have to get at special places. It turned me off for a long time, and perhaps why it's an important design idea for me. I frequented our local game store for years before I actually played a role playing game. I even ventured out of the board and card games section and bought a couple of rpg's that seemed interesting. But it seemed like I would need extra equipment (available at the store) and seasoned role playing gamers. Sure, but I'll have to wait until next payday. At the time--in my late 20's and early 30's--I didn't know any who still wanted to play. At lot of that was perception. Fancy dice sounded cool, but....<br/><br/>So, given my personal (and admittedly perceived) barriers to getting into rpgs, I like to incorporate the existing card associations into the game. So mixing familiar "story" elements into a role playing game, makes said rpg even more accessible. Cards are really fertile ground for story telling, plain and simple. No need to let that interfere with the story you want people to tell. There's enough there to enhance your game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, even if you know a thousand card games, when you're <b>playing</b> a game you may never really look long at a card and think about the story behind the suits, the details in the pictures, or the visual triggers you get when you look at the faces. It's possible to disregard those associations or create new ones.<br/><br/>We do that with dice, even if those associations aren't part of a game. Certainly some games have specific colors you use for specific reasons. And aren't we all attracted to pretty dice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138104/#Comment_138104" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T07:44:46+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  7:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the Wisconsin State Game, Matt, Sheepshead (something like Shoepskhof in the original German). Which is similar to Euchre, but more complicated. I tried to teach it to Sorensen one day, and I think he blew a gasket. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue is not thematic. How in the heck are cards not thematically appropriate for Spies? Let's see... what does Bond play in Casino Royale... oh, yeah, poker. In fact the card play is a metaphor for what's going on at the interpersonal level between the spies, a perfect representation of the bluffing and counter-bluffing of espionage. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can't buy into clubs and diamonds thematically for fantasy RPGs, use Tarot decks with Pentacles and Wands. Yeah, that would be dissonant. Right!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue here is not theme but tradition. My response is that, if you're going to pry players away from D&amp;D, they're open-minded enough that cards are fine. Here's the rule I would use: If you can't do it better with cards than dice, use dice for familiarity. But if you can do it better with cards, the better design is more important than the small infamiliarity some players may have with using cards for RPG resolution. Traditional players aren't idiots (on the contrary, they play RPGs so they must be enlightened!), they'll see the benefits. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had worried about whether or not using the term Coins would alienate anyone, or whether or not to make Universalis more acceptable to traditional RPG players, nobody would be playing it today. No, we don't reach a huge market, but appealing to people who like D&amp;D is trying to sell green snow to an Inuit. They've already got plenty, and why would they care about the color?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138108/#Comment_138108" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T07:59:25+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  7:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 7:59AM by David Artman.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best advice so far, for Steve, has been "ask at Enworld" [or RPG.net].

A d13 which simultaneously "rolls" a d4 each draw... but which can only yield four cards of any given value without reshuffling (or multiple decks) or thirteen of any given suit. So if a resolution system is served by this direct coupling of a d13 and d4, and the inverse relationship of availability, then a deck of cards is a perfect randomizer.</blockquote>Basically--as always--don't design for some anecdotal or hypothetical customer who will have a negative reaction to a "non-traditional" randomizer (non-traditional ONLY in the eyes of RPGers; very traditional to most others). Rather, design what works best and promote its application unapologetically. It's far from ""making a focussed effort to overcome" card-use; it's celebrating their use for both accessibility and for the thematic or systemic strengths of the deck of cards as used in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138129/#Comment_138129" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T09:11:56+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  9:11AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First post here... err.... Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm slightly puzzled but the Cards=Poker thing, but I guess like other people have mentioned, it may be an American thing. I defiantly think cards would seem more natural than polyhedrons to non-gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to run a game called Suzerane that used cards, no one baulked at it then. Some people seemed to like them because they reduced the amount of maths at the table (most maths in gaming is trivial but I've seen at least two gamers use a calculator to sum 2d6 and a modifier before now, we're talking science-based university students here too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI currently have a game in the 'queue' to be designed (after my current one) which I'm designing to appeal to non-gamers, which will cards. It's a murder mystery game so if card make some people think of bluffing and the like then hopefully it'll do it's job well. The non-gamer angle was one of the reasons I chose cards for the mechanics. It's a loose collection of notes atm so I guess I'll have to wait to see how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of Tarot cards, I don't think they would go down well with the mainstream... to 'weird'. Saying that my current game-in-design uses them to reinforce the high magic / dark fantasy theme. Unfortunately the first round of play testing used dice so again, I can't say anything too useful about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138137/#Comment_138137" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T09:44:29+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  9:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify, I don't think Steve is talking about new- or non-gamers (I made the same mistake). He's concerned about a "traditional" gamer's possible negative reaction to cards, being very non-traditional for RPG gamers. See my posts above for (a) where I think they'd best-acquire useful data and (b) why even that isn't relevant, if one puts design priorities first and, thus, realizes that nothing replaces cards (except the rare and elusive d13 + d4, no more than four identical values from the d13 allowed or thirteen identical values from the d4 allowed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138140/#Comment_138140" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T09:53:58+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  9:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some other great things about cards:<br/><br/>They're persistent - you can roll 18s all night, but you can only ever draw one King of Spades, and once you have it under your control, it's yours exclusively.<br/><br/>They're colorful - look at those cool backs and fronts!<br/><br/>They're tactile - move them around in your hand, shuffle the deck, fan them out, close them up.<br/><br/>They get players to sit at a table, which I am the only one in my group that likes to do. *arms crossed defiantly*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
