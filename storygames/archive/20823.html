Last week we played Follow by Ben Robbins, the info and recap are below this weeks info.<br/><br/>Where:<br/>Demolition Games<br/>85 West 3300 South, Salt Lake City, UT<br/><br/>When:<br/>Thursday, October 20, 2016<br/>6:00 PM to 9:00 PM<br/><br/>Our group gets together and plays different Indie RPGs and Story Games. The groups also play-tests each other's RPGs and Story Games, which are in development. The type of games we could play, are any and all types of Indie RPGs and Story Games, but here are some examples: Apocalypse World, Fiasco, Dungeon World, Burning Wheel, Lady Blackbird, Fate Accelerated Edition, Kagematsu, Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Rest Your Head, Fate Core, Microscope, Kingdom, Primetime Adventures, Urban Shadows, Blades in the Dark, Mouse Guard, Monsterhearts, Archipelago, Swords Without Master, Polaris (the "indie" one), and many, many more.<br/><br/><b>(This week we will be playing Lady Blackbird by John Harper). </b><br/><br/>Here is a little bit about the game we will be playing:<br/><br/>"Lady Blackbird is on the run from an arranged marriage to Count Carlowe. She hired a smuggler skyship, The Owl, to take her from her palace on the Imperial world of Ilysium to the far reaches of the Remnants, so she could be with her once secret lover, the pirate king Uriah Flint. However\u2014just before reaching the halfway point of Haven, The Owl was pursued and captured by the Imperial cruiser Hand of Sorrow, under charges of flying a false flag. Even now Lady Blackbird, her bodyguard, and the crew of The Owl are detained in the brig, while the commander of the cruiser, Captain Hollas, runs the smuggler ship\u2019s registry over the wireless. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they discover the outstanding warrants and learn that The Owl is owned by none other than the infamous outcast Cyrus Vance. How will lady blackbird and the others escape the hand of sorrow? What dangers lie in their path? Will they be able to find the secret lair of the pirate king? If they do, will Uriah Flint accept Lady Blackbird as his bride? By the time they get there, will she want him to?"<br/>-from Lady Blackbird <br/><br/><b>Here is the link if you would like to RSVP:</b><br/><a href="https://www.meetup.com/wasatch-rpgamers/events/234903570/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/wasatch-rpgamers/events/234903570/</a><br/><br/><b>Here is a recap of last week's game of Follow. We played Follow by Ben Robbins. I had a lot of fun. We roleplayed and created a super crazy and creative story you can read bellow:</b><br/><br/>Our mission was to colonize a new planet. Our group was a fledgling penal colony: felons, outcasts, and the politically inconvenient. The planet is Gulag; an ancient cluster of space junk coalesced together by gravity through the eons. In fact, the planet may only be made of space junk.<br/>There were immediate rumors about getting rid of the weak, of leaving them on the planet\u2019s surface so the strong could then take the ship. The planet surface turned out to be highly electrically charged--portions of the planet highly alkaline, others strongly acidic, like a big ol' battery.<br/>It wasn't clear if the planet could be made to grow plant life or not. By the end of the first challenge the colony's farmer had indeed stolen the ship, and the colony had been started in a bad location.<br/>Alkaline spiders were picking off colonists. Perhaps these spiders were sentient, it wasn't clear. The spiders had been seen praying by one of the crew members but it was also speculated that it may have also been some form of a mating ritual. Acid launchers were created, but they were ineffective. The crew captured some of these spiders and locked them up in a containment chamber.<br/>A recreational "pharmaceuticals" expert stumbled on a secret, a euphoric drug that allowed him to live among the spiders. He and a felon sent to tail him left the colony and joined the spiders. Apparently, when humans who took the drug were near the spiders the spiders became docile; eventually these two crew members became the kings of the spiders and were even worshiped by them. <br/>As we approached the end, the colonists were still dying, and the food and oxygen running out fast. Experiments were made (on willing and unwilling subjects) with eating the planets' flora and fauna. The captured spider\u2019s biology was too different from humans to test the flora and fauna on. Eating the flora caused the human subjects a euphoric painless death. Eating the fauna caused a painful non-euphoric death.<br/>Mania and panic set in. All the colonists died, except those who had abandoned the mission.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457160/#Comment_457160" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-17T20:27:15+00:00" title="October 17, 2016  8:27PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2016 8:35PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of 2<br/><br/><b>Group Feedback:</b> <br/>The above is just a summery and leaves out a lot of the juicy bits of interpersonal relationships that were very funny and entertaining...sorry, I just don't have time to cover everything. We failed every challenge--six red stones ha ha <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The response from the group was interesting. Three of our players come from a GM oriented RPG background; two of them had a hard time staying immersed in the game and their characters being that they tend to play games that are a bit different. For one of them, it was his first Story Game; he was unsure how he felt afterword about it but his later comments seemed to be positive. He did comment that he had a little bit of a problem with how outlandish the story got--a feature of Follow that I love. One of the players didn't really comment on the game. I think the players above just need time to digest the differences between Story Games and the games they are used to. Two players, me and another player familiar with Story Games absolutely loved it, being that we love the creative and fun stories Follow produces and are huge fans of the game. I think that Follow is absolutely brilliant; it creates amazing stories yet is simple and amazingly elegant; and, most importantly, it is fun!  <br/><br/><b>How the groups is developing, challenges and trying to get more people on board:</b> <br/>While there seems to be a lot of interest in the group (about a dozen or so people so far) our attendance has been less than I had hoped for. Many times we have 9 people signing up only to have about 5 show up and the others dropping out by game night. Here are the games we have played so far, how many people showed up, and how things went: <br/><br/>Week 1: Fiasco (5 players). I was sick this week but apparently it was a very fun and successful Meetup.<br/>Week 2: Mongol 2.0 (4 players). This was a RPG designed by one of the members of our group. I think the session was hit and miss. The RPG's mechanics where a bit too traditional for our group; however, the GM put a lot of thought into developing and cultivating pre-generated characters that led to some interesting intrigue. It was a sci-fy intrigue session that took a bit to start, but it snowballed into something interesting only to have a somewhat underwhelming ending. I was however very impressed with the amount of work the GM did and the great intrigue setup.<br/>Week 3: Follow (5 players). Some players where getting used to the Story Game format but I think this session was an absolute success; I also think that as these player had time to think about the session and appreciate Story Games for what they are instead of hoping to get the same experience they get from the games they are used to, that they have warmed to the session and appreciated it much more. Those of us familiar with story games had an absolute blast <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm not sure how to get more people coming. I was thinking that I might post the event on multiple, different RPG Meetups, but I'm not sure if this is allowed on meetup.com;If anyone knows I would really appreciate it if you let me know. I also need to figure out meeting space as the group grows; I think we can probably get away with using 3 to 4 tables at Demolition Games but I'm hoping to expand the organization into something larger than that if there is interest. If anyone has an idea for how to advertise and recruit people I would appreciated it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm also considering forking up the money for an actual Meetup group on meetup.com (I think this probably helped Ben Robbins' group Story Games Seattle expand) instead of just hosting events on other Meetup groups; however, I would like to get more people on board so I would know there was interest before committing the money.      <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for the interest and any ideas are appreciated <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457170/#Comment_457170" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T02:06:39+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:06AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm going through similar issues right now as well - I'm trying to run two different groups.  One at work that's just co-workers and happens at work after hours (so it's easy for people to attend) and one that's public (via a meetup group).<br/><br/>First, I think you should be prepared to have to do a fair amount of work in the beginning in terms of advertising it, cajoling people to attend, etc.  I'm also struggling with how to get the word out such that I can keep it in peoples minds but not be a pest.  I've been mentioning it on discussion groups and I'm about to start putting notices up on physical bulletin boards at places like universities and local game shops.  Both of my groups are right on the edge of having enough people show up.  I've just acknowledged that I'm going to have to drive it a while before it just runs itself.<br/><br/>As for getting your own meetup, you're on the Wasatch Tabletop RPG group which has almost 1400 people on it.  That's a large pool to draw from.  I think it's just a matter of enticing enough people.  If you can even get 2%, you'll have more people than you know what to do with.  I'm not sure having your own meetup will help much.<br/><br/>I'm curious if picking your game ahead of time is helping or hurting.  Some people might not attend because they think they don't want to play that. Or that everyone else probably knows how to play already and they would be the odd man out.  Whereas if you take the SG Seattle method and pitch games (which includes requests in my experience), that might help.  Maybe try both ways for a while and see what works best. I can't really say one way or the other.<br/><br/>Sorry I don't have more concrete suggestions.  In the big picture though, three sessions is still really early.  Don't get discouraged yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457173/#Comment_457173" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T02:31:00+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:31AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm curious if picking your game ahead of time is helping or hurting.

The only drawback would be that we might end up playing less games. Maybe, I don't know?
