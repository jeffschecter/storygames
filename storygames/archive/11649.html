They make a point of doing this: "I'm running in every slot". <br/><br/>Generally, gamemasters get praise for running lots of games. Perhaps this isn't surprising: convention organisers love it, because it fills slots.<br/><br/>But there's something that bothers me about it. Partly, it's a personal thing: often, these GMs are people I like. They're great players, too. I'd like to play alongside them, but they're too busy running games. At particularly busy conventions, when games sign up quickly, I might not get to play with these guys if they run in every slot.<br/><br/>And, partly, I wonder whether we should encourage people to run lots of games. Some GMs can run game after game, bringing the same energy to each. But I know I can't. Rather than encouraging people to run lots of games, perhaps we should encourage lots of people to run a single game.<br/><br/>What do you guys think?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259823/#Comment_259823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T05:35:47+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  5:35AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 5:39AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there should be more games without GMs, which puts a big dent in this problem.

And it is true that hosting a GMless game isn't the same as showing up and playing one - you are still facilitating and the session still relies on your enthusiasm and experience to some degree. <br/><br/>In large part I agree with you, though, Graham. It'd be great if there were enough eager facilitator/GMs to require a rule limiting each to two sessions or something. The overall quality might improve, although I'm a little dubious about that.

There are some conventions where if I am not running games than I am going to be sitting around during slots because the only other open games are going to be games I am not interested in or that I don't enjoy as convention games with strangers. And then there was one pretty bad convention where when I wasn't running a game, I wasn't playing at all because all the other games were totally booked because so many people came to play but so few people signed up to run.<br/><br/>I do think encouraging lots of people to run games is great. I do it myself. However a lot of people don't want to run games, are too lazy or forgetful to sign up to do so, are afraid of the idea, or whatever. So I see myself as filling in for those people and ensuring my own happiness at a convention to boot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259825/#Comment_259825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T05:47:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  5:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 6:03AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I GM'ed for twenty years, and only played in two games.

I think most players have no interest in GMing, but it's not a problem with RPGs specifically.  I've been involved in all sorts of organizations where there are people who want to organize or lead, and people who want to just participate.  Heck, sometimes when I get together with friends just to play a boardgame, the first ten minutes are spent waiting for someone else to decide what to play.  <br/><br/>I think trying to get participators to organize often leads to tears and recrimination.  That said, there are dynamics that can frustrate would-be organizers, such as the group consciously or unconsciously discouraging new organizers from entering the group, or previous participants who want to become organizers.  If there seems to be a dearth of GMs, it will help to find out if people are harboring secret desires to be a GM that are somehow being frustrated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259835/#Comment_259835" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T06:21:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  6:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 6:25AM by jenskot.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>I know a part of the reason I do this at some conventions is because if I run a game, I am pretty sure I am going to enjoy it.</blockquote>\nThis is true for me, too.<br/>Same for me! <br/><br/>I also feel as a GM I'm in a better position to help everyone else have fun (I can do this as a player as well to a lesser extent).<br/><br/>That said, I'd love to see more people GM.

And often that can take a while.<br/><br/>Especially at a convention, people may be afraid that they will play with someone who knows the rules inside and out and instead of helping a new GM run the game they will keep pointing out all the things they are doing wrong. Hell, some people will point out all the things that are wrong even if they are actually the ones who are wrong! <br/><br/>Which is mostly an issue of expectations. If everyone knows the GM is new, it's in most people's best interests to help them rather than discourage them. But if someone is playing, especially at a convention, they are probably doing so with the expectations that people GMing have experience with the game (they are probably there to have fun and play rather than teach). It's similar to running playtests. I think if people know what to expect, it makes everything easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259846/#Comment_259846" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T07:42:17+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  7:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tough topic!<br/><br/>We used to do this thing called the "Gaming Circle". About a dozen people joined.<br/><br/>The deal was: there was a room reserved for us every Saturday, from 1:00 to 5:00. Each member, upon joining, committed to running something on one future Saturday in the Fall and one in the Spring. You'd just pick a date and sign up.<br/><br/>Everyone who joined didn't feel it was too hard to commit to running one game a season, but suddenly, look, we had gaming every week for a whole school year. (Players would rotate, of course--but most people couldn't or didn't want to be there every week anyway.)<br/><br/>So, there's definitely something to be said for a GM limit: both minimum and maximum.

Let's say 2100 of them were TT RPGers (prolly more, but I like easy math). It has 7 slots that one can practically attend (Fri aft/nite, Sat morn/aft/nite, Sun morn/aft). That means for any given slot, 300 (!!!) games will be going, each of which could have six participants in a perfect arrangement.<br/><br/>OK, assume CONsider can set up 300 tables. Not every participant will be at the con for every slot (and even if there, they might do a LARP one-shot, or play some minis, or any number of other things). So you have a hope of six per table, but you'll probably average three per table. AVERAGE--many tables will get full (4-6) while others will have non-viable sizes (2 for Universalis, frex).<br/>-----<br/>Another point: GM badges. Many, many GMs run at cons because that's the main way they can afford to attend. And cons offer up three-and-free quite commonly--give up (roughly) half the con to run three slots and you get the whole weekend free.<br/><br/>What does a con do that's going to go "run to come"? Can't let everyone in free. SO which GMs are no longer attendees, because they can't "iron GM" and get in free? (And this isn't even speaking to folks who can only spare the one, three-slot day AND need to get in free!)<br/>-----<br/>As a four-slot GM most cons, I try to mix facilitating (GMless, Are You A Werewolf?, etc) with running (GMfull) so I don't burn out, because I tend to get all my "obligations" done in a single day (with MAYBE one slot on Fri or Sun). Sure, I'd like to play more... but I almost ALWAYS get an extra game in because one of mine don't make.<br/><br/>Interesting idea... but the "con ecology" has evolved into what it is fort several, diverse reasons. It would be hard to innovate too much, without changing the cost-bearing aspects of the con along with the scale of and venues for it (e.g. Nerdly run as all-volunteer, all-GMs, all-players, all-pay, non-traditional affordable venue, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259914/#Comment_259914" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T10:50:12+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 10:50AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely a con ecology issue. Who runs what, and what the expectations are at your con has a big impact on how things go for everybody. It varies from con to con, and I think it has to.<br/><br/>At GPNW there are no GM badges, so who runs what doesn\u2019t directly impact our bottom line. We do, however, have a high percentage of pickup games. If we don't have people ready to step up and run a game, it can be an issue. It has never been a *big*issue at GPNW, but it's also not something you want to ignore. Having an iron gamemaster at the con really helps with this! But if that gamemaster isn't having a good time, it comes at too high a price. You can't just blindly rely on the iron GM's to take up the slack; that's unfair to them.<br/><br/>What works great, I think, is when there are some willing people on hand who have a game that they are excited to throw down and run when it's needed. I've done this, for example, with IAWA at both GPNW and ConQuest. Other people have done this over various slots at GPNW with D&amp;D and Dogs in the Vineyard. You need enough people to make it work. If it's just one person, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>So to sort of get back to Graham's original comment: I have no problem with a person running games all day, but I do have a problem with expecting them to do so when it might be negatively impacting their fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259931/#Comment_259931" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T12:50:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 12:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who is guilty of doing this, my reasons are straight forward and two-fold.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, as stated previously, by running a game of my choice, I'm more likely to have fun than in that slot of the convention than I am by trying to sign up for a game that interests me.

People who like to GM tend to be good players so far as the system (and the GM) support creative thinking, ad-libing and all that story, character, narrative and all that crap. I take that part about system back; really, it's about GMing style. The Trad GM runs a DnD or similar module, wherein the characters' particularities are irrelevant, in character acting is tolerated - at best - and mostly it's this weird combat grind with wooden acting as social currency. Many players thrive in that environment. That 's their comfort zone. Put those same players in an "Indie" game at a con and they are game, so to speak, but scared and nervous. Whereas, you put a GM cum player in the module and they chaff to the point of derailing that little pre-planed arc. But, you put those GMs in the "Indie" (or GMless) games and its a fucking riot. <br/><br/>I mean, not to make the typical Marxist division of society into a dialectical pair, but their are those who are comfortable selling their character-power for a game and those who own the means of narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260155/#Comment_260155" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T04:07:08+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  4:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gamemasters who run lots of games: do you think your last game is as good as your first?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260159/#Comment_260159" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T04:33:02+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  4:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Gamemasters who run lots of games: do you think your last game is as good as your first?</blockquote>\nObjectively, no.

The more I run, the more my mind becomes attuned to the players, the more in the moment I become, and the more flexible I am to make the most out of the game. The first game is usually ok but rarely the best. <br/><br/>But I approach most games with no expectations. I go where the players take me and I only mitigate the direction when it causes real life conflicts between players. So every game becomes a gamble! Which I think might be another reason I love running so much. Each group is a new beginning and the more I run the more likely there will be at least one huge, huge success!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260180/#Comment_260180" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T07:44:08+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  7:44AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Gamemasters who run lots of games: do you think your last game is as good as your first?</blockquote>In my experience, I can not make a definitive answer. Some cons, my later games are more facilitating and less "driving". Other cons, I make the mistake of trying to wrap up on IAWA, which still challenges me as a GM (especially demoing/teaching it).<br/><br/>But now that you ASK that way, I'm going to be more conscious of how I schedule my slots (in as much as Gaming Coordinators allow, of course). Try to trend to more participatory games later in the day, where I can leverage the flow I've attained (like John says above) without having to carry too much of the weight of the session. Close with Contenders, not with IAWA (in a nutshell).<br/><br/>Probably best to do it like a bell curve, where your most challenging-to-GM sessions are in the middle of an "iron run" so that you can ramp up on the first session, peak in the second, and they enjoy the afterglow in the third.
