It ends up taking more time trying to understand the text than playing the actual game and writing up feedback. <br/><br/>I suspect it would be easier for us to play with broken rules than broken text. At least if we know the rules aren't working, that's useful to you. But if we don't understand the text which leads us to misusing the rules and then we give you feedback based on our misunderstandings of your rules... then we haven't actually playtested your game rules!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> reason... multiple sessions.<br/><br/>For me personally, I can convince my friends to play anything for 1 session. But to get them to pre-agree to 3-6 sessions of a game they don't know will work or like... it's too much work for me.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> reason... don't care.<br/><br/>I'll try new games because I love the theme and/or the game is trying to do something new mechanically. If the theme doesn't grab me and the mechanics feel too similar to games I've already played, I will probably pass.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> reason... burnout.<br/><br/>I used to have 2 weekly playtest groups where we would test our friends' games. We burned out. Having the rules change based on our feedback every session was too much. It was like we had to learn a new game every week. <br/><br/><b>What would help?</b><br/><br/>- Give us a stripped down text that only tells us the minimum we need to play.<br/>- Include a short example after each procedural step.<br/>- Sometimes include short counter examples as well. "Don't do this."<br/>- Screw the text, send us a Youtube video!<br/>- Make it so we can playtest a part of your game in 2-3 hours.<br/>- Get us excited about your game. What's new or different about it?<br/>- Don't overuse us. After we give feedback, don't give us new minor rule updates. Wait a while after you've made major changes and then give us the new rules.<br/>- Give us something in exchange for playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379452/#Comment_379452" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:22:07+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:22AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 7:22AM by jenskot.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should have playtested my post :-)<br/><br/>What I meant to ask is why don't playtesters playtest designer's games more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379455/#Comment_379455" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:26:33+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:26AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 7:27AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!<br/><br/>The biggest reason is that I don't know the designer.

I never had any and they weren't really necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the best venue for me to run a playtest are forum meet-ups (small local meet-ups or large national meet-ups alike) where folks are typically open to that sort of thing. With my regular group (if I can even call it that) we rather like to play a relaxed game session with a tried and true system. Generally my appetite for new systems has waned over the last couple of years, not only with playtesting but with any sort of "new concept, new rules" game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I playtest, I take it seriously, try to really dig into the material and give solid feedback. That's a lot of work and what certainly helps is a certain reassurance that the designer is dedicated to finish the game. Not counting my own, I've been a playtester for two games that were actually published (Breaking the Ice and Western City) and maybe four or five that never really went anywhere. So your credibility and "name" are certainly important. If you are an active and well-respected contributor to online discussions, that may lend you credibility. If you have already published good games, that, too, naturally. If you are just some new guy with three posts and a messy PDF, well, you have to find another way to earn that cred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379459/#Comment_379459" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:31:28+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent question, John!<br><br>I have two gaming groups.

If that won't work for your game I can't really help you (and your game is too complex).<br/><br/>The central idea needs to be both interesting to me and palatable to the group I playtest with. Dungeon World has been an easy sell because we all enjoy old school fantasy anyway, for example. <br/><br/>The documentation needs to be clear and engaging. Even if it is stupid and broken on a mechanical level it should be pretty well organized in terms of who does what, when. It should be interesting to read, by whatever arbitrary measure that suggests. "Wall of text" = not interesting to read. Give us a handout that explains the whole game, because my buddies are not going to read it anyway.<br/><br/>Honestly I'm in a better position currently to comment on drafts without playing them. I do this a lot and I hope it is helpful on some level. It is certainly less useful than actual play but more useful than nothing, which is often my other option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379467/#Comment_379467" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:57:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love -- LOVE -- playtesting the right stuff. If the premise grabs me or the mechanisms seem novel, I'll probably sign up one of my groups for at least a single session. But they also playtest my stuff, so a) they're accustomed to playing oddball material and b) they understand that for-real playtesting isn't always that "fun." So I try to not overuse them. Maybe once a quarter is about all they can tolerate.<br/><br/>I'll play from design notes that clearly outline procedures and expectations. I will not play from a draft that seems like the writer is trying to present a "finished" work, because I won't trust it. I get playtest drafts from Luke that look/read finished-ish but I trust that he's gone through many, many iterations of the rules well before I've seen them. But I think/fear a common error by new designers is that they've seen a playtest draft like that and assume that that's how playtesting works. It isn't! That's like the third or fourth draft, much closer to a reading edition than a playing edition.<br/><br/>Another real error, and I've done this myself most recently in the excitement over my MGSF draft, is hitting your playtesters too often with small changes. One readthrough of a lengthy text is hard enough! Nobody but you will really even notice the small changes that you're hoping to get feedback on. Another reason not to present reading editions to first-read playtesters.<br/><br/>Things that help me when asked to playtest:<br/><br/>* Clear rules-oriented draft<br/>* Explicit questions about specific procedures and ideas<br/>* Acknowledgement of the feedback, which does not need to happen in real time. If I see at least some of my feedback has found its way into a future edition, I know you're using my stuff.<br/>* Clear expectations. I participated in an early playtest of one of Jason's copier-repair game and it was incomprehensible to me -- largely because the guy facilitating the test didn't educate me on what to expect from "a Jason game."<br/><br/>Things that have worked for me when asking for playtests:<br/><br/>* Regular engagement with my favorite testers<br/>* Knowing the testers -- Bret is 100% right that friends are more likely to do a thing than acquaintances. Although that jerk never did set up a playtest for my last game...hm. <br/>* Asking different groups to focus on different parts of the rules, rather than The Rules in toto.<br/>* Clear play expectations: I need a single session, which should last 2-ish hours. Try to hit the (mass combat) and (commodities trading) systems.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379469/#Comment_379469" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T08:16:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:16AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 10:50AM by David Artman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I *own* games that I haven't played outside of cons because of my game group.

That broke up (due to a combination of scheduling difficulties and not having a next game to play, if I remember right). I would playtest more, but in order to do it I'd basically need to do all the social wrangling necessary to get a group organized, possibly involving trying to recruit new players, but social organizing doesn't come naturally to me and I don't have enough energy/motivation to do it through sheer force of will (especially since there's a chance of bad chemistry or a negative experience when you try to form a new group with people you don't know). I'd also probably have to be the one to find the game (not easy, since finding a good one involves weeding through a lot of poor or mediocre games), and be the "facilitator" who teaches everyone how to play (which I find draining -- I wish I could get some more gaming time in which I "just play" to recharge my batteries, but since I'm pedantic and somewhat obsessive about playing games correctly I usually end up in the "rules guy" role). I've released recordings of the playtests on my AP podcast <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a> -- if I had a bigger listener base or listeners who actually engaged and discussed what they heard on the show that would probably motivate me to playtest more, but the show is pretty niche so I understand why it doesn't have a huge following.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379486/#Comment_379486" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T09:12:45+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:12AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A diagram or brief checklist on the rules is certainly a plus.

Playtesting was out of question, back then.<br/>There were times when I was able to organize groups of people to play, but those groups were shaky enough, those friends being relatively inexperienced and looking at me for guidance, that playtesting with them felt like a risky proposition. My aim was, first and foremost, to get those people to play again. And still, sometimes I playtested with them (rarely).<br/>There were times when I met up with the same friends on a regular basis to play, but those friends refused to playtest: their line of reasoning was, playing time being already at a premium, one should take pains to make the most out of that time - which includes picking tried and tested games only.<br/>Now that I've got semi-regular <i>and frequent</i> meet-ups going on, that my "games I've never got able to play" shelf is smaller than ever, now that I trust my fellow players with not blaming any "failed" games on me, ever, and - most important point - all of them are fine with playtesting\u2026 I've taken to playtesting with glee. I blind-playtest with my "regular" co-players, besides participating in playtest sessions designer friends run at conventions. But still\u2026\n<ul><li>providing feedback after a playtest, in writing, is work. Thus, when I agree to blind-playtest something, I know I'm making a more substantial investment of time than if I just joined a session of any game. This means I can't playtest as much as I can play.</li>\n<li>I believe my feedback as a playtester is only useful because of my experience playing (somewhat similar) games, especially when I'm the one organizing a blind-playtest session and collecting the feedback from all participants. You want me to be a fit, well-conditioned player when I playtest for you. Thus, I <i>shouldn</i>'t spend as much time playtesting as I spend just playing.</li></ul>\n\u2026which means that the competition between titles/designers for my playtesting time is huge, an order of magnitude larger than the already-cutthroat competition for my playing time, you know?<br/>In practice, it means that to bother playtesting a game I have to be super-super-excited about it (or maybe one of my regular friends has to be), in a "I'm dying to try it out and I can't wait it's finished" way.<br/>I don't think my case is an exceptional one. The bottom line is: to get any playtesters at all you've got to be very good at promoting your design and making people excited about it. All of the tricks which apply to marketing a finished product apply here, except the difficulty dial's turned to eleven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379512/#Comment_379512" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T11:25:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2012 11:25AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting, as I do it, is very hard:<br/><br/>* I don't playtest unless you give me the text you intend for the game to have. Part of playtesting a game is playtesting the text. If your text doesn't get a procedure across to me correctly, that's important information to have. I check for spelling, grammar, organization, and that your fucking math works out okay. (Fuck art, nobody cares about art even when the game is out. Wall of text is fine. Wall of text is great. Why don't you make a wall of text version of the final game, huh?! Other than that nobody but me would buy it.)<br/><br/>* I don't playtest unless I am really psyched/interested about the product. This is why I did Dirty Secrets, Leverage, Sons of Liberty, Verge, Marvel Heroic, and PTA3 - because I really really want those games to succeed and be awesome, feel they are significant in some way or I'm pumped about them.  It doesn't have to be a "theme" that I care about, if you've got a really exciting generic/universal system, I'd be thrilled to playtest it.<br/><br/>* I only ever playtest blind - I never listen to anything you say about your game on forums or whatever, I assume you're lying about or stupid about everything you say about your game but that your text is exactly spot on to what you want it to be.  You are never in the room for the test, this is easy because none of you bums live around here, but even if we were at a con or something I would kick you out and yell something angrily at you if you tried to be in the room or "help out" in some way with respect to your game, what do you know about this game anyway, nothing.<br/><br/>* I expect to be given a print copy of the final game (if there's going to be a print run).  I appreciate a "thanks" in the credits, but I'm not so in love with the sight of my own name that I'm disappointed if I don't see it there.<br/><br/>* I expect to be able to get you on the phone or skype and go through painstaking detail of your work with you.  It can take a long time, but it's the best way to get the info across in the postgame.<br/><br/>Because for me playtesting is highly rigorous and formalized, not casual at all, I don't do it all that much. Playtesting is <i>not for fun</i>.  You may have fun doing it, or you may not, probably you will because RPGs are fun and you wouldn't be in the hobby if you didn't think so, but having fun is not the purpose of playtesting a RPG text.<br/><br/>That should explain why I don't do it that much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379517/#Comment_379517" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T11:57:54+00:00" title="May 23, 2012 11:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worth mentioning after JD's list of "I don't playtest unless" points: there are several steps, several tiers of playtesting. All of them are useful to the designer, depending on the specific of their design process. Each of them is different and asks different things from you as a playtester.<br/>For example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Part of playtesting a game is playtesting the text.</blockquote>\nOnly in the <i>last</i> phase of a design process, in my opinion. Provided this phase can be the longest one for some projects, of course.<br/>On the other hand, only the last couple playtest tiers are commonly outsourced, and "blind" playtests are usually only employed in the last step(s) - thus, that's what JD's talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379532/#Comment_379532" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T12:43:40+00:00" title="May 23, 2012 12:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jason's take on playtesting is solid -- and is referring to a fairly late-stage process, much closer to reviewing a finished product.

I guess even if I knew about a lot of games that wanted playtesting I'd maybe be worried about wasting a lot of time on poor-quality products.<br/><br/>What we need is some kind of playtest swapshop. You know, like the babysitting voucher thing[*]. Everyone starts with some number of playtest points. Whenever someone playtests your game they get a playtest point from you.<br/><br/>This could (a) incentivise people to playtest more games, and (b) incentivise people not to put forward playtesting material before it's ready (waste of points!). Of course it would rely on having a reasonably sizeable community of playtesters signed up and not "cheating" by going elsewhere or the points would be worthless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381722/#Comment_381722" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T12:04:19+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 12:04PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot the [*].
