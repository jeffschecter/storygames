Representatives of both groups are planning a secret meeting in the Fell Woods.<br/><br/>So that was my prep...I kind of freaked out though when it came time to actually start the game, and instead we just played Munchkin. I just wasn't sure how to actually use my Fronts. I've GMed a ton of different systems: d&amp;d, burning wheel, mouse guard, paranoia, dogs in the vineyard, inspectres, and even the First Session of Dungeon World, but for some reason I just don't understand how to use Fronts.<br/><br/>I'm basically imagining two different adventure tracks: get involved directly with the siege of Andwynne, or try to interfere with this budding alliance. But I'm not exactly sure how to kick off the action or get the adventure started. And once it does start, I'm afraid it will either end abruptly or meander around aimlessly. I don't want to pre-plan a bunch of stuff, but can't help but think I'm missing something. I read the Beginners Guide to DW, and definitely liked the stuff about writing good Fronts, Portents and Dangers, and loved the example Campaign Front, but I still don't understand how to grab an Adventure Front and run with it.<br/><br/>Any advice? Links to examples of applying Fronts? Ideas on how you'd handle the Adventure Fronts I sketched above?<br/><br/>Explain it to me like I'm a four year old <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416392/#Comment_416392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T22:10:08+00:00" title="June 15, 2013 10:10PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the Fronts should be building off of the First Session. All the juicy stuff that popped up in that session should mold and guide your Fronts, and your Fronts should start tangling into the forward momentum.<br/><br/>All Fronts have impacts. Those impacts are your hooks from the current action to the Front. It sounds like you may have constructed your Fronts in a vacuum without taking the events of the First Session into account.<br/><br/>What happened in your First Session? There's plenty you should be able to connect to the Fronts. You might have to do a little Front-editing, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd" title="HyveMynd"><img alt="HyveMynd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/564/nZ3DM2UV4QM5S.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">HyveMynd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416399/#Comment_416399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T02:18:53+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  2:18AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a> said, the Fronts you're writing up should be built from all the notes you took during the First Session. The whole point of the First Session is to generate a lot of fiction for you to build your Fronts from during downtime. I mean, you don't <i>have</i> to do it that way. The First session could just be a sample session to show your players how <i>DW</i> works. I've run a bunch of one-shots for different groups, and in that case I build a Front first so the players can jump right in and go. But if you're running a campaign, <i>not</i> building your Front from the Fist Session notes means you'll have wasted all those notes you wrote down during the first session, which is kind of a shame.<br/><br/>Your Fronts, Dangers, and Adventure Fronts look good from what I can see so far. I would go through the list of Dangers (pages 189 to 192) and pick a Danger that's impulse feels right for both the Rebel Army and Monstrous Alliance. To me, it seems as if the Rebel Army is an Ambitious Organization: Misguided Good (impulse: to do what is "right" no matter the cost), and the Monstrous Alliance is a Hordes: Wandering Barbarians (impulse: to grow strong, to drive their enemies before them). But that may not be the case. Find something you think fits.<br/><br/>Then, just like the Grim Portents section (page 194) think about what would happen if each of those Dangers proceeds towards their goal unmolested. Come up with one to three steps with a final Impending Doom at the end. The Grim Portents from one Danger can affect the other Danger you've written up, but they don't have to. You could even roll those Dangers into a single Danger, since they both deal with the Rebel Army.<br/><br/>For example, you've mentioned that the Rebel Army is going to lay siege to Fortress Andwynne. What will  happen if the player characters <i>don't</i> intervene? It should be something that has a tangible effect on the game world. First, perhaps the Rebel Army completely surrounds the fortress, trapping the Imperial troops inside without a way to send for help. Then, after a bitter struggle the Rebels capture the fortress, destroying the Imperial troops inside, and gaining a stronghold for the Rebel Nation. Next, weakened from the fight, the Rebels initiate negotiations with the Northern Mountain Orcs and Goblins in an attempt to swell their ranks. Lastly, the Orcs and Goblins join the Rebels, and their combined armies swarm down and carve a huge chunk out of the Empire. The final Impending Doom could be Tyranny (the strong over the weak), or Usurpation (the chain of order comes apart), or even Rampant Chaos (the laws of society break down).<br/><br/>That's four steps from "everything's OK" to "we're in serious trouble". That's what Fronts should be. Events that, if left unchecked, will have a serious (and probably negative) impact on the game world that the player characters will feel.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416406/#Comment_416406" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T09:16:53+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  9:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd think the difference between taking notes from your first game to make the fronts and making fronts to use later is the introduction, which relates PCs with such fronts and makes them care about them. The former takes whatever players come up with to make the world go around them, the later is like putting bait in front of the players and both push/pull/ them to fall for it. Or if your players are more collaborative, use this as a big sign saying "adventure is this way". <br/><br/>You can make both work, since none is better than the other per se; you sound like you and your players are more used to the later, but you know that you would need a lot more of material (a bigger and better bait) to make it work for your group. Quick solution if you're still on that angle: give PCs specific hooks into different fronts and god reasons to stick together. Perhaps one of them has ties to the alliance or the empire in the form of people they don't want to see hurt by the other side, are seeking info on something important for them, etc.<br/><br/>The other angle is to follow the game's advice, play a session and built from it, let the elements of that session snowball down the hill against the setting and put players in the middle. When players take interest in a setting element it's simpler to lead them to adventures, and as a player, to find out that your input has created something into the fiction, usually makes that element really important for the player.<br/><br/>E.g.: Once in a campaign, our GM introduced the father of one of the PC's as a really strong figure, only to kill him later and show us how strong was the enemy. The son PC didn't care too much, but when we realized what this part of the plot was about, we had our characters push into the limits of their abilities to save this NPC and barely succeed. This single NPC became then so important to us that we made the GM create a sidequest to finally put him out of danger and later became a major figure in the story. It may have started as a joke about twarthing the GM's plans, but it became a really good memory of that campaign in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416427/#Comment_416427" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T14:00:20+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  2:00PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it seems like the main problem is that you are not sure how to translate ideas in the form of fronts etc into actual things that happen in play? Am I reading that right?<br/><br/>Okay, so <b>Fronts</b> are not things that happen. They are just an organizational tool -- you put a bunch of things that are connected under the same heading. It is not even necessary to have fronts at all if you don't want to think about them.<br/><br/><b>Dangers</b> are the real antagonists. You don't want to make them single people (unless they are powerful wizards or gods) because then you kill one dude, the problem is solved. They should take more work than that. But! A danger is still not a thing that happens, it's just a thing that exists. It's a group of people, a problem in a society, a cursed location, whatever.<br/><br/><b>Grim portents</b> are the things that happen. Each grim portent is a thing that happens that puts a danger closer to it's impending doom. You can write these in a specific order, like the invading orcs have only one real path they can take to get to the capital, so that's a list of places they will sack on the way there. Or, say the evil wizard has to collect four magical artifacts in order to perform the demonic ritual, he can collect them in any order.<br/><br/>If you write them in chains that happen in a set order, you can write each one on a card and stack them up in order, with the first one on top. Set these piles up next to you when you GM. When it's your turn:<br/>1. Look down at the grim portents that are on top of each pile.<br/>2. Pick the one you like the best and remove it. Put it in front of you, focus your attention on it.<br/>3. Tell the players how it appears in the fiction, see what they do with it.<br/>4. Whatever they do, implement the fallout.<br/>5. Go back to the grim portents and pick another one. Repeat.<br/><br/>Maybe one of your dangers doesn't get a lot of screen time -- that's a sign that you don't really care about it. Maybe you should revise it so you ARE excited about it, maybe you should scrap it. But this is just a way for you to focus on exactly what could happen next, to get away from being distracted by the big picture. You can think about the big picture in between games, during the game what happens next is the most important thing.<br/><br/>If you write them in pieces that all need to be completed in any order, you can key them to locations on a map, either specific or in general. Like the knucklebones of Saint Donovan are located in the Cathedral of War, but the Spear of Fire is somewhere in the Kingdom of Aldissan and you haven't decided where but when the PCs go there, you can start thinking about it. And then you have plot hooks to grab onto based on where the PCs decide to go. Or, if they never go there, you can decide to advance that danger's grim portents and then you tell them about rumours and stuff that happen because the evil wizard is off in Aldissan doing evil stuff. And then maybe they can go and check it out and stop ignoring it. Or they only catch up with the evil wizard once he's started performing the ritual because they were busy concentrating on some other dangers you have going -- it's up to them, as long as you keep things moving forward on your end.<br/><br/>Dangers and grim portents are the key things. You have some antagonists and they have agendas, which you write in the form of a list. Fronts is how you separate and group these dangers, partly so you can manage them and partly so you have a way to draw connections between them. But that part isn't necessary, especially if you only have a few dangers going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416428/#Comment_416428" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T14:49:46+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  2:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looove the idea of a stack of index cards for Grim Portents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kruug" title="kruug"><img alt="kruug" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kruug">kruug</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416436/#Comment_416436" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T19:30:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  7:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, so many good responses!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a>, the reminder to tie into what happened in the first session is kind of a facepalm moment for me. We had a couple weeks between the First Session and my Front prep, so I sort of forgot about some of the details. I checked my notes, and my players got a 10+ Carouse check and chose the "useful NPC", "interesting rumor", and "not ensorcelled" options, so that's an easy way to give some introductory exposition of the two Dangers at hand, and let the players decide what to do.<br/><br/>The Front wasn't really designed in a vacuum. In the First Session, my players said they wanted some sort of game that involved warring nations, and I thought it might be cool to be fighting two different enemies at once - monstrous hordes from the North, as well as some sort of enemy nation (why not a civil war?). In the first session they went on a typical kobold extermination mission, but uncovered some dark signs of bigger problems.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">@HyveMynd</a>, your Dangers and Grim Portent tracks are eerily similar to the ones I wrote down <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I debated about merging them into one, but around the 4th Horde Portent, I liked the idea of the alliance eroding, and potentially having the monstrous hordes spin out of control. We'll see what happens!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, I think the problem lies with me, not my players. For some reason I feel this urge to over-prep for Dungeon World. I <i>want </i> the game to be built completely organically around what my players find interesting. I have no desire to write up a bunch of backstory and detailed, scripted adventures...but at the same time I look at my notes and think, "I can't possibly have enough material here to run a game."<br/><br/>But...your analysis of my players has given me the idea that I should just ask them a few pointed questions that hooks them into the situation and reveals more about the world.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a>, you nailed it. I'm looking for advice on how to translate my Fronts, Dangers, and Grim Portents into things that actually happen in play. I love the notecard hack! <br/><br/>That gives me an idea for a dynamic, shifting dungeon Adventure Front with say, 4 Dangers with 4 Grim Portents each. When one Grim Portent is resolved, the other 3 Dangers advance to the next card. So the PC's tackle one of the remaining ones, and that makes the last 2 advance to their second to last Portent. Leaving just the remaining Danger and the final Grim Portent that the PC's have to try and stop, otherwise the Impending Doom happens.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for the good advice. I think I just need to relax and roll with it, and resist the urge to over-prep, and play to find out what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416443/#Comment_416443" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T21:19:51+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  9:19PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woohoo!

How will this interact with the players now, immediately?<br/><br/>It's no good to have a Grim Portent which says, "The Rebels take over the Fortress", if the PCs are 40 leagues away from there. You draw up the Grim Portent from your deck, you let them find out it's happened, somewhere far away... and then what? You may be able to get something out of it by asking questions (and having smart and proactive players), but it's also likely to be just a dead end. Ok, we know something bad happened far away. Now what? Everyone's looking at you awkwardly.<br/><br/>So, make sure all your prep is somehow rigged up so as to interact directly with the PCs. (And, whenever possible, let the players' input do the work for you; but if they don't, you have to.) Look over each idea/card/whatever, and rework it until it's something you can immediately turn into some kind of active situation or scene for the players to deal with. Maybe in this case it's "Imperial soldiers, routed and panicked, are fleeing from the battle, and they want to pillage the local town/hide in the local town, with the Rebel army in hot pursuit". That's something you could introduce into the game, immediately, wherever the PCs currently are, and could give you a whole session of play (or even more). Then you ask the players questions to fill in the gaps. ("One of the soldiers is someone you've fought with before. What's your history with him?" "They've got a captive, it looks like, dragging behind them with a rope around their neck. You know this person. Who is it?" "What do you fear their presence could damage or destroy in this village?"
