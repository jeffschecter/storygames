And all power to their collective elbows. <br/><br/>However I'm looking to do something different. My wife, along with some input from Ken Hite and me, wrote the The Investigators' Guide to Occult London, also known as Liber Fumo de Frater Vigilo or the Book of the Smoke. This is a gazetteer of places and people with occult significance in 1930's London, written from the viewpoint of a deceased Occultist. In some ways, it's a Dictionary of Mu for Trail of Cthulhu, but it's also a murder mystery as the author died under mysterious circumstances (and were I playing InSpectres I could use any ghost book or copy of Weird [Your State]). There's a sample of the Occult Guide <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=4005" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>What I want to do is to use this book to run improvised games. I give the book to the players and ask them to find an entry they wish to investigate and then we play a game. I've done this four times now with pretty good results but I don't have any procedure that I follow. I don't do any special prep for these games except for having excellent knowledge of the history and occult scene in London, something which I wouldn't presume others should have.<br/><br/><b>I wondered if SG impro types might be able to help in working out a procedure to follow so that others can do similar things without too much hassle or prep.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
