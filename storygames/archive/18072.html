I just wrote it and I'd love your feedback. I've annotated my writing process below, in case anyone is curious.<br/><br/>The <b>introduction</b> is written as an early Buddhist discourse, though the sentiment it expresses is more Great-Vehicle-ish.<br/><br/>The <b>names</b> all come from very specific sources:<br/>\u2022 \u201cLost Lark\u201d was my friend Dave Berg\u2019s Hocus in our long-running Apocalypse World game.<br/>\u2022 \u201cSouthern Crane\u201d was the name of L\u01d0 M\xf9 B\xe1i\u2019s master in the W\u01d4d\u0101ng Clan in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/>\u2022 In the <i>Journey to the West,</i> \u201cMonkey Awakened to Emptiness\u201d (\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, zh. S\u016bn W\xf9k\u014dng, jpn. Son Gok\u016b) was the name given to the Monkey King by his Daoist immortal tutor.<br/>\u2022 In Dragon Ball, \u201cTurtle Hermit\u201d (\u4e80\u4ed9\u4eba, Kame Sennin) was the name of Son Gok\u016b\u2019s master.<br/>\u2022 \u201cSupreme Logician\u201d was the name of a character my friend Dean rolled up but never got to play.<br/>\u2022 All the other names are buddhas and bodhisattvas from the Lotus S\u016btra.<br/><br/>Under <b>Look,</b><br/>\u2022 \u201cFocused Eyes\u201d refers to the legendary gaze of Bodhidharma, founder of Dhy\u0101na (meditation) Buddhism. According to myth, he either cut his eyelids off so he wouldn\u2019t fall asleep while meditating, or they fell off of their own accord. \u201cThree Eyes\u201d refers to the third-eye cakra between and above the brows, a symbol of enlightenment which was sometimes illustrated literally.<br/>\u2022 \u201cShaved Head\u201d refers to tonsure practices such as those of Sh\xe0ol\xedn Ch\xe1n (Dhy\u0101na) Buddhist monks. \u201cRitual Hairstyle\u201d refers to dreadlocks, Mexican wrestlers\u2019 prided long hair, or that weird thing Prince Zuko had going on during the first season of Avatar: the Last Airbender. \u201cInexplicable Headgear\u201d refers to articles like the huge cylindrical basket which komus\u014d wore at all times, or the Japanese Buddhist warrior-monks\u2019 odd little white hoods.<br/>\u2022 \u201cColorful Tattoos\u201d refer to the Sh\xe0ol\xedn monks\u2019 forehead markings, or airbenders\u2019 arrow tattoos.<br/><br/>As for <b>stats,</b> I wanted monks to hit reasonably hard but not be quite as durable as rangers or barbarians, for example. They\u2019re supposed to be fending off hits, not taking them.<br/><br/>The <b>human move</b> reflects humanity\u2019s adaptability and commitment. The <b>orphan move</b> refers to the stories of characters such as S\u0101n D\xe9 from Sh\xe0ol\xedn Master Killer and Kwai Chang Caine from Kung Fu, both adopted by the Sh\xe0ol\xedn Monastery after their families\u2019 deaths; and the Mexican friar and masked wrestler Fray Tormenta, who ran an orphanage for 23 years, inspiring such characters as King from Tekken and Jack Black\u2019s Nacho Libre.<br/><br/><b>Bitter Work</b> is the name of an Avatar: the Last Airbender episode that features the frustration and difficulty of Chinese boxing training, often called \u201ceating bitter\u201d in modern Chinese. The move requires monks to spend hours every day training to get the bonuses of their style.<br/><br/><b>Martial Discipline</b> synergizes with Bitter Work, allowing monks to get more oomph out of their daily preparation. The various different ability scores represent the fact that different fighting systems would prize different attributes: t\xe0ij\xed boxing would focus on STR, aikid\u014d would focus on WIS, and capoeira would focus on CHA, for example.<br/><br/>I decided not to focus too hard on unarmed or unarmored combat with the monk; the fighter\u2019s \u201cFists\u201d option already called dibs on that. Accordingly I went with a style that was truer to martial arts movies, where armed combat is as important if not more important to martial heroes and villains. <b>Style Over Substance</b> allows a monk to use nearly any weapon that enters their hands effectively. In w\u01d4xi\xe1 films, specialists with a single weapon are usually supporting characters or what we call NPCs. To keep the action fresh and interesting, the main character is more commonly a generalist who\u2019s able to use any weapon that comes into their hands: again, think of S\u0101n D\xe9 in <i>Sh\xe0ol\xedn Master Killer</i> or its successor <i>Sh\xe0ol\xedn vs. W\u01d4d\u0101ng,</i> who uses his fists, swords, the three-section staff of his own invention, and the quarterstaff; or Jip Man in the films of his name, who uses a wooden pallet, kitchen cleavers, and a broomstick in addition to his formidable unarmed combat skills. Besides, in Dungeon World, signature weapons are more a fighter thing; if the monk wants one, they can take the fighter move (see Meet the Buddha, Kill the Buddha below).<br/><br/><b>Third Refuge refers</b> to the Buddhist Sa\u1e43gha, the third of the \u201cThree Jewels\u201d with which the Buddhist takes refuge. The example orders are Mexican masked wrestlers, Chinese w\u01d4xi\xe1 heroes, the martial arts schools that pop up in any dense city, and the legendary tengu and other mountain mystics who supposedly trained the first ninja and Minamoto no Yoshitsune.<br/><br/>The <b>alignment moves</b> refer to the ascetic or personal discipline and submission to a Law which many religions require (Lawful), and to the middle or moderate way which Master L\u01ceo, Master Zhu\u0101ng, the Buddha, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and Epicurus advocated.<br/><br/>Under <b>gear,</b> you\u2019ll notice that the monk has pretty low carrying capacity, because monks generally aren\u2019t associated with cartloads of possessions. Even the strongest monks won\u2019t be able to carry all the heaviest options. The weapon options refer to the traditional weapons of the gyrovague (monk\u2019s spade), Japanese Buddhist warrior-monk (glaive), or of unassuming-looking combatants the world over (quarterstaff). The small weird weapons include the flute (the shakuhachi which was often a Japanese wandering monk\u2019s only defense) and other weird weapons often associated with monastic training; <i>Ancient Chinese Weapons</i> by Dr Yang, Jwing-Ming showcases many of these. I also had to throw a bow in there for zen (dhy\u0101na) archery. The bag of books refers to the s\u016btras which monks sometimes had to haul from place to place.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408005/#Comment_408005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T11:49:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 11:49AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the advanced moves \u2026<br/>\u2022 <b>Duck and Weave</b> is the \u201cunarmored\u201d move. It\u2019s very powerful since Defy Danger is the new act under fire. ~_^<br/>\u2022 <b>Favored Technique</b> was gonna be named \u201cTokui-Waza,\u201d which is what it\u2019s called in j\u016bd\u014d, but I\u2019m already pretty obscure here anyway.<br/>\u2022 <b>Grasshopper</b> was one of Kwai Chang Caine\u2019s nicknames from one of his masters in Kung Fu. The move allows a monk to keep fighting while yelling instructions to his student, a w\u01d4xi\xe1 standard.<br/>\u2022 <b>Holier Than Thou</b> and Meet the Buddha, <b>Kill the Buddha</b> refer to the monk\u2019s place kind of between a fighter and a cleric. The latter move name is a quote from the Buddhist monk L\xednj\xec Y\xecxu\xe1n/Rinzai Gigen, founder of L\xednj\xec Ch\xe1n/Rinzai Zen Buddhism.<br/>\u2022 Daoism and Buddhism both preach <b>non-attachment,</b> so I thought I would name the move that allows monks to give up getting lots of money after that.<br/>\u2022 <b>Rival Schools</b> was originally named \u201cSh\xe0ol\xedn vs. W\u01d4d\u0101ng\u201d after the most famous rivalry (and one of the best films) in the martial arts world, but I figured a reference to a recent fighting video game would be better-received.<br/>\u2022 <b>Wire Work</b> refers to the wire-powered acrobatics used in a boatload of bad old movies too low-budget to get proper stunt work, and <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</i> \u201cFlipping market stalls\u201d seems to happen in every possible action sequence, most notably to the cabbage guy in Avatar: the Last Airbender.<br/>\u2022 The <b>Had\u014dken</b> is a fireball attack from Street Fighter. \u201cBreath\u201d is \u201cq\xec\u201d in Chinese or \u201cki\u201d in Japanese, but I posited that other mystical sources for such power might exist\u2014in capoeira we speak of ax\xe9, for example.<br/>\u2022 <b>36th Chamber</b> refers to the alternate title of <i>Sh\xe0ol\xedn Master Killer,</i> which is <i>The 36 Chambers of Sh\xe0ol\xedn.</i> In the film, the 36th Chamber is the supernal chamber of one\u2019s Buddhist training, at which point the monk breaks free of monastic restrictions and shares martial arts with the people\u2014representative of bodhisattva-hood, basically. Accordingly it frees the monk up to yell instructions at any of his bonded teammates, not just a designated student.<br/>\u2022 <b>First Among Equals</b> was the title of certain ranked monks in Neal Stephenson\u2019s <i>Anathem,</i> to which I had to restrain myself from making more references. This is the \u201cbe a lord and have a keep\u201d move.<br/>\u2022 <b>If Do Right, No Can Defense</b> is a Mr. Miyagi quote from <i>The Karate Kid,</i> referring to the crane technique.<br/>\u2022 <b>K\u014dan</b> refers to the Zen (Japanese Dhy\u0101na) Buddhist habit of meditating on paradoxical statements, and confusing the hell out of everybody else in the process.<br/>\u2022 <b>The Last Whateverbender:</b> You\u2019re welcome.<br/>\u2022 <b>Iron Lotus</b> was originally \u201cMetal Flower,\u201d after a <i>Legend of the Liquid Sword</i> character\u2019s special technique of collecting lots of weapons and sticking them all together. I changed it to \u201cIron Lotus\u201d to refer to the deadly skating technique from <i>Blades of Glory,</i> a movie I have not seen and will never see.<br/>\u2022 <b>Octagon</b> refers to mixed martial arts because you get to mix your school with another school.<br/>\u2022 <b>Supreme Ultimate Boxing</b> is the English translation of \u201ct\xe0ij\xed qu\xe1n\u201d (\u592a\u6975\u62f3).<br/>\u2022 <b>Universal compassion</b> is encouraged by various religions and philosophies, most notably Mohism, a philosophical school which didn\u2019t really have monasteries per se, but which produced a lot of siege engineers to defend towns against marauding armies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408007/#Comment_408007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T12:05:05+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 12:05PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can only humans play the monk?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408008/#Comment_408008" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T12:07:23+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 12:07PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2013 12:37PM by Lula.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, the "orphan" choice opens monks up to any other race (although if you choose "white guy adopted by Asians" you take -1 ongoing in real life forever).
