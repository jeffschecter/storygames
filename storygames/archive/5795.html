When I put My Life with Master into book form and brought it to Gen Con in 2003 it wasn't as a product. It was more like a scientist publishing his findings in a scientific journal. And Sorcerer, and Polaris, and The Mountain Witch, and WYRD, and Donjon, and InSpectres and Dogs In the Vineyard, and Bacchanal, and Capes, and PtA, and I could go on, are the same. We were all playing like crazy, exploring different social architectures for play, testing the limits of roleplaying. Putting your successes together as a game text was feeding them back into the community. Just like scientists put their findings into journal articles.<br/><br/>If you go into the Forge/IPR booth and you see games like Carry, and In A Wicked Age, and Spirit of the Century and you're underwhelmed, it's because you're inhabiting the role of consumer and seeing the games as products. And the product/consumer paradigm expects nothing of the consumer but the cash transaction. But you are not a consumer, you are a colleague and a scientist. A journal article engages a scientist as a participant in the scientific community. The journal article gives you something to do, something very personal to your abilities, and the work is enlarged by your efforts. Spirit of the Century is enlarged by Judd's The Revenge of Zombie Kong and the Lightning Zombies! scenario. Agon was enlarged by post Gen Con play. Games are enlarged by talking about them, and comparing notes. <br/><br/>To be honest, the "putting your successes into a game text and feeding them back to the community" dynamic has been eroding a bit, and so we're seeing games with less basis on the designer's exploration of the architecture of creative collaboration to the point of success. But the solution isn't superficial insider roastings couched as "open and honest" criticism; internet games build barriers that keep people out of the community. The scientific community is diminished by status games. The solution is to let the games put you to work within the community, knowing that your efforts will enlarge them.<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129694/#Comment_129694" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T08:32:53+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  8:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very similar to how I feel about game design, too.

A perfectly valid one, I hasten to add.  My only hesitation in signing on board wholesale, though, is the price points that are assigned to these not-products that are siphoning back into the community.  I can understand a price point that covers costs, and a price point that allows the designer the capital to kick off the following book.  But $20 for 47 pages of half-letter, where all the art inside is public domain?  $24 for 92 pages?  These are not books whose intent is sharing; these are books whose intent is profit.  And I should dare say Luke's motivation is not simply sharing with the community!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129727/#Comment_129727" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T10:33:12+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 10:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>The issue is the word "product".

What I can't do so well is couch it in the jargon that appears to be part and parcel of the "fellow colleague" model. There has been a specific language that has popped up in regard to defining and talking about roleplaying games, and it looks like Etruscan to me. I've had Sorcerer in one form or another since the mid-90's, and only now do I even feel close to capable of explaining it to other people. And quite frankly, I feel that if I come on somewhere and try to explain what I'm not grasping about a game, and where it falls apart for me, I'm going to end up feeling like a buffoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I get what you're doing with Acts of Evil, and I think it'll be awesome if you can nail down how to get players to make their own Protagonists consistently. As to how to figure out how to do that...I wouldn't know where to begin. And I feel like, if I can't help you do that, all I'll be able to contribute to the game is polishing and window-dressing, which may end up more annoying than helpful. If I can't wrap my head around the theory, and what types of mechanics are necessary to achieve those effects, how do I know what I say isn't more of a hindrance than a help?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, Tony, I appreciate the work you guys are doing for the hobby. But your games require, from my POV, a pretty big buy-in in regards to unlearning a lot of gaming habits that have been established in the industry. Sorcerer required, from me, a bigger buy-in in that regard than I initially expected, and it threw me for a loop for the longest time. I admit that Capes totally boggled me when I tried to read it and figure out how it was supposed to play, I had a similar reaction to Burning Wheel when I saw it in a rough draft form, and while the Equations are clear and concise for Acts of Evil, there are things that Paul is looking for and I'm looking for that I don't know how to articulate, let alone offer suggestions on how to fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd quite frankly, roleplaying games are awesome as a hobby. I personally consider them superior in potential to just about every other form of entertainment out there because they directly engage you, the participant, in the experience. <b>But</b> there are plenty of people out there who want to be just consumers, who want to use the game as an excuse to get together with friends and entertain themselves. They won't have the time or energy or, quite frankly, enthusiasm to contribute feedback comparable to a fellow scientist giving a peer review. Plenty will try, and they should be encouraged, but I'm worried that under the "fellow scientist" model, there will be a huge buy-in of having to learn the established jargon necessary to give the targeted feedback you, the creator, crave. And I do worry about people having a legitimate criticism or suggestion, but because they don't know the right way to express it, they get ignored or shut down. I'm dubious about the possibility of raising the bar for entry into this hobby any further than it is, because I'd like to see more people gaming, and I'd like to expose more people to RPGs, and I'm worried that increased buy-in runs the risk of keeping people out of the hobby, people who'd be more likely to stay in and get hooked if they weren't worried about having an obligation to give feedback in a journal-style format.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, what I just wrote was comprehensible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129737/#Comment_129737" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T10:45:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 10:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But if it helps, I always looked at the games on the Forge, especially in the early days, as lab experiments designed to highlight situations that many felt weren't being given proper exploration in more traditional RPGs. That's a big chunk of why the RPGPundit's criticisms of the Forge never took with me: he assumed (as you stated) that the RPG was a product, when what it really was was an experiment in design specifically made to challenge the current orthodoxies in game design. Now, a lot of those experiments are starting to pay off because those experiments have been folded into a newer generation of RPGs, and first time players and veterans looking for something more are starting to get the types of games they always wanted, but couldn't articulate on their own, with the rough edges filed off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I agree with your initial post, but I do have some reservations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129751/#Comment_129751" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T11:09:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 11:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a nice thought, but at the end of the day these games are sold to consumers just as other RPGs are.

I see you as an insider.  I think you're a really cool guy, but you've published your nifty book, you hang out with the other publishers, you're active at various cons, and you are a part of a (wonderful) well known podcast.  All these things you've done add to the weight of your words and feedback.  I'd rather have you critique one of my games than a complete stranger, and I'd give your words more weight too.

Any science is, indeed, a collaborative discipline and the feedback of students and research assistants on the theories and ideas of the major players is no doubt valuable to the discipline as a whole.

That's a good question. For me, academia has never been all that enjoyable. I was never a terribly good student.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have always enjoyed work, and I am very happy with my colleagues. However, I nonetheless play games as an alternative to said work. It's something that I do when I am finished with my work. When I buy a game, or a novel, or a DVD, I am looking for entertainment. Admittedly, some entertainment is brainless fun (Slither) and some is jaw-droppingly superlative (No Country For Old Men). And the same goes for games.<br/><br/>The idea of reading a scientific journal is an interesting prospect, but it is one that I would associate with work, and not with leisure time or recreation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129785/#Comment_129785" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T13:43:12+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  1:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 4:22PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I've always had the feeling that "The Community" is not one group of people.

You can post your own motivations and perhaps find the folks who agree.

Or, rather, making back your investment, and a few bucks more, are neccessary as the payment we scientists get for being scientists. Otherwise it's as though you've suggested that scientists should all have day jobs, and do their science pro-bono. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich, given that practically nobody in indie-rpgs has actually quit their day-job, means that we're not even at the level of suggesting that RPGs should support those who make them. Simply that it not be a financial burden. From that perspective simply breaking even in the short-run is probably the only true "success" goal for indie-rpg designers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso consider that the "reasearch" we do on our games consists of analyzing actual play. Note that it may be a great irony, but true, that a game that is given away for free will not get as much play as a game that's charged for in many cases. So the setting of price points here to create a perception of value is, in part, part of getting the game to more people. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other theory would be that we're doing it to get rich. Which is to laugh. I'd posit that even the "mainstream professionals" who publish RPGs do so more out of love than a desire to get rich. I do it because I am compelled to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon just showed me a way that I can do it so that I won't go broke, and people will actually play my game. Instead of it just remaining an idea in my head. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me happy, too, don't get me wrong. Why do the science, if it's not to improve something, namely RPG play? Its not sterile research, it has a goal, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, that said, just because our ethos is not to create the same old schlock in order to sell to the greatest number of people, that does not mean that our games are actually any less approachable than others, neccessarily. Oh this may be the case in some cases, sure. But I'd posit that any difference in level of approachability is covered under Caveat Emptor. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill that mean we sell less games? Well we're not really concerned with selling a ton of games. Just enough to get the research done, and the game pay for itself and maybe research field trips to GenCon. Enough so that our spouses won't complain about the time we put into doing it. There are costs involved, you see. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe've simply made the research self-perpetuating. And if/when people have a lot of fun playing our games, then we've gone past the research and achieved the end goal, too. That of making play more fun for some people. And that way we slowly change the hobby, hopefully for the better. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not "research" per se. That's a metaphor. But the point with Push is that, whether or not another copy comes out ever, many of us do see it as something like academic research. And, who knows? Maybe some day soon, some university will open up a school for RPG design or such? And then we'll be off and running, student fees and research grants paying for us to become full-time design professors. At which point then, sure, the cost of the games will only be that of the distribution of the periodicals in which they come. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, we're already very close. I've just been offered a position to teach RPGs at a local private high-school, for a short time in the summer. Trying to figure out how I can swing it, as I obviously can't quit my full-time job to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's a step.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130171/#Comment_130171" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:43:17+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:43AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, don't conflate "acting like a businessman" and "trying to get rich" just to dismiss both at the same time.

Well he might be at a different level. I don't think that Luke is publishing for research. No, he's gone past R&amp;D, and into sales for profit, yes. But he's an exception to the rule. Someday, perhaps, I may move into publishing like that (likely not on my own, however, I don't have Luke's energy). I think that publishing for profit is a fine thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's just not typical of this community. What is typical is the model that Paul is describing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr put another way, what I fear is that people who read your post might see a conflict of interest between research and making a profit at the level that we do to stay afloat. All I'm saying is that no conflict of interest exists here for the vast majority of people who are publishing under this model. If you're not implying some sort of conflict of interest then I'm really not sure what it is to which you are objecting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130251/#Comment_130251" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T11:30:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 11:30AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my Artifact Matters thread I put up a post where I vehemently disagreed with Josh that a game should communicate everything about itself to you the moment you pick it up but I couldn't figure out why I felt that way.  Later that day Paul talked to me about it over IM and said the same thing to me he's said here in his original post.  To which I fully agree.  I was going to post it myself after mulling it over for a day or two but I see Paul beat me too it.<br/><br/>My games and the "community" I associate with regarding those games do not communicate everything you need to know when you pick it up.  Only after you've tried it, thought about it, given feedback, heard the community response and maybe even tried it again has it communicated everything you need to know about it.  It's not a product.  As I said, it's an invitation to engage the game and raise questions about you and your play preferences and culture (as Ryan Macklin put it).  The cost of the game is the cover charge to that party.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130259/#Comment_130259" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T11:41:32+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 11:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I think I agree with Josh there, Jesse. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think we learn much if we can't count on being able to link the feebback to the text that spawned it. Sure, we learn things here all the time in terms of advice. But like I said in the thread about publishing games, vs advice, that's a completely different thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, yes, we will learn some things neccessarily after the fact: no game text is perfect in it's communication. But it should at least *attempt* to do all it can in communication. Not merely be the price of admission to discuss the game online. Way too incestuous if that's the only way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if that were, in fact, the express way that the game was written (perhaps even with disclaimer), I could see it as a model. But if you present a book that doesn't say that it's not everything you need, then it should do what it can to be completely self-contained. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130265/#Comment_130265" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T12:06:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 12:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>This is why I've had so much trouble articulating my feelings.  I full agree that we have a lot of work to do in the area of clarity of text and completeness of play.  I think the Half-Baked Game, Games That Requires Practice, The Designer Not Included, and the Clarity of Procedures issues I listed in my Artifact Matters thread are real.  I'm not arguing against better clarity in the text.  God, I've been Sorcerer's harshest critic in that department.  Lacuna's deliberate silence on what it's about and how to play it is kind of anoying to me.<br/><br/>On the above: Criticize away!<br/><br/>But Josh and co seem to be pushing into the realm of the superficial.  Josh talks about public domain art or aesthetically pleasing layout and so forth.  I hated the second printing of TSoY's cover art.  Did I say anything?  No.  Because ultimately I know it has nothing to do with the game.<br/><br/>I also STRONGLY object to any notion that a game can be evaluated without actually playing it and self-reflection on what the game brings vs. what you yourself brings to the table.  So, no I don't want the game communicating, "all I need to know" just by holding it in my hands.  I went indie to get away from that commercial visual and hype driven bullshit.<br/><br/>It's almost like the philosophy I've adopted at the cons.  I run games that don't sound fun.  I've learned that when I run games that sound superficially exciting like Don't Rest Your Head and My Life with Master I get a certain non-serious goof-ball player who just wants to run around being an evil minion and misses the entire point of the game.  But if I throw up Dirty Secrets and my write up seriously references Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald in a dry literary way then I get people who are serious about that stuff showing up.<br/><br/>So yeah, make your game ugly as shit and let the word of mouth about the ACTUAL GAME sell it to you.<br/><br/>Which is, in my opinion, an drastic overstatement but I want to be clear on where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130305/#Comment_130305" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T14:08:18+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  2:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>But Jonathan has already announced that Push's future as a product, as a thing you hold in your hand, is very uncertain, probably nonexistent.</blockquote>\nWhen did I say that?

But if it's Lulu-only, I think we may be talking about a different playing field?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130359/#Comment_130359" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T18:46:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  6:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might I suggest here the phrase "<a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/07/31.html" rel="nofollow">gift economy</a>"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130370/#Comment_130370" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T19:52:25+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  7:52PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh and Co!

Something is superficial if it appears to be something on the surface and isn't underneath.  I'm not advocating that.  I'm advocating taking what is already there, underneath, and bringing it to the surface.  So figure out what the game does, and then on your back cover or whatever actually <em>write that down</em>.  Otherwise, you have the opposite of the superficial: the arcane, in which the surface does not match the thing's nature underneath.  When done accidentally, this is amateurish; when done intentionally, this is called <em>lying</em>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130380/#Comment_130380" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T20:30:28+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mike --</p>\n<p>So you're saying that what I overlooked in my early puzzlement at how the indie scene worked was that the whole "indie RPG publishing as a very small business venture" model is, in fact, analogous to the whole structure of the university -- it's the infrastructure that supports the research and invention, which allows it to happen, that gives it a social and economic context.</p>\n<p>And it's even more awesome cause you can give yourself tenure. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></p>\n<p>Is that what you were saying there?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130418/#Comment_130418" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T02:47:17+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  2:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The university and scientist models fall apart a bit when you consider that no one in a university or in a 'pure' research facility is doing so without funding of some kind.  Their creativity and innovation is being subsidized by a much larger superstructure which is banking on an eventual return: in the case of the university (at least in the humanities), this is in prestige, or possibly in the sale of a book, and the labor involved in teaching classes.  In an incubator environment, it's in the spin-offs - technologies and the like that have market value.<br/><br/>I am in total agreement with the idea that there is inherent value in a sort of 'pure' pursuit of the invention of gameforms for their own sake - if not 'for the community'.  But to expect such production to go on without any meaningful compensation - in whatever form - is asking for the impossible.  Furthermore, there are already a ton of games that have been released essentially for free: all you need to do is go to the Game Chef website and start pawing around in the archives.  How many of these games have been investigated or exploited?  Few, if any.  There's still an attachment of the idea that a free pdf is worth less (in an immaterial sense, mind you) than a game put up on IPR for sale.<br/><br/>I don't see anyone altering that dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130446/#Comment_130446" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T06:07:41+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 6:09AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian: "...or possibly the sale of a book"<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really not seeing the disconnect, Brian. Actually Ed's comment is more damning: "...you can give yourself tenure." That's where the model falls apart somewhat. Because no matter how conspiratorial you are about this little community, the fact is that it's pretty free-market. There isn't really any peer review that results in games not being published if the publisher still wants to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nGame Chef is starting to come really close to peer review. But it's still in the realm of "You ought to do this with this game," not, "No way you publish this until you do XY and Z with it."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd frankly I'm OK with that. Using the free market to determine what's good or not is just fine with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn't deny the goals of the people making these games. Which is largely to advance the hobby, or just be creative in making their design, and getting to see if they've made something worthwhile to anyone. That's where it's precisely like science. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd where the entire "industry" tends to lean that way, too. Less so for some outfits, but Steve Jackson is the original mad scientist of RPGs. Striking out on his own from Metagaming in order to make the games that he felt people would like, because they were the games he liked. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just lean a bit more explicitly in that direction than the "industry." <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is far, far from a new idea with regards to how we see this community. Is it any surprise that this is what emerged on a web site moderated by a professor? People would come to the Forge and deride it for it's academic atmosphere, to which we'd respond... "that's a negative how?" Yes, it's exactly what we've always sought, and what we've gotten. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me be really clear about this. I am no academic, in that I dropped out of college. Three times. But that's probably largely because I was studying things that didn't really turn me on. I was too busy playing RPGs to even go take my tests. If there had been a school for RPG study, I'd have my Phd now. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoreso, I hope to have my Phd in gaming someday. Again, as someone not immersed appropriately in academia, this is probably a pipe dream at this point. Or maybe not. But the point is that I think it would be great if, in fact, some university would start a program for RPG studies. Maybe not what the world needs most, but it's not a bad idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause that's probably the only way that we'll ever get pure actual peer review on these "papers" that people release as games. And I think that would be a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that all RPG production should go this way, by the way. Just like, say, computer science, there should be researchers, and there should be people working in the market to meet market demand. It's the combination of these two things that best leads to advancements in a field. And it's what we lacked entirely in RPGs before, say, RFGA, and which has started pretty seriously with The Forge, and which would have to end up at a university somewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we're close. I know several people who have now written their doctoral theses on RPGs, even if they were for other fields like sociology. There are schools in Scandanavia that are getting really close to having full-fledged RPG studies departments. Classes are springing up in secondary level education (even if only summer-school activities here, in Scandanavia, again, they're part of regular weekly activities in some schools, or even more embedded). I'm sure there's more going on than I'm aware of. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill it ever get there? I don't know. But in the meanwhile, this community serves as a reasonable substitute, from what I can tell from my non-academic background. Rather, it is what it is, and that's a pretty positive force. Yes I'm biased, but it's my hobby too. I'm part of a community that's improving things for ourselves, if for nobody else. I'm sure others are benefited, but if we only helped ourselves, that'd still be enough reason to do what we do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why we have the attitude like, "Mainstream doesn't like it? So what?" Er, hence the term "indie."<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
