Each of us were responsible for selecting a question each one of us had to ask and it was quite humorous to say the least. By the way, this is the backstory. We never addressed the method we choose to have these questions answered.<br/><br/>As a teaser, listen to Will and the gang dodge questions like:<br/><br/>What is your least favorite color? What fantasy author would you like to bed? What political party represents you the most?<br/>Tune in and find out on this (kind of) exciting 50 episode celebration!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
