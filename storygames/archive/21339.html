After years of apprenticeship, the younger female shamans will be tested on their ability to become vessels for the pantheon of spirits, generals, and deities that they will then evoke through dance, movement, and language. I don't want to cheapen the complexities and importance of the Korean Shamans by saying that what they're doing is role-playing, however, there are some potentially useful comparisons that can be made between the performance aspects of their craft and the performative elements of role-playing. <br/><br/>Before turning this into a long-form essay, I wanted to state that I believe there are unexplored concepts in role-playing games that could be extrapolated through looking at role-playing games not just as play spaces, but also as ritual and performance spaces. How can exploring the connections between magical practices, rituals, liminality, and role-playing games lead to innovations in design practices/mechanics/ ways of thinking about games? <br/><b>Rpg materials</b><br/>This continues to the level of the ways we think about materials. When we consider that dice have a long history of being used as divinatory tools, how some dice are hand-picked from stones in the earth and the great care that's invested in considering the materials used in ritual spaces could lead to changes in thinking about the ways materials are used in games. The Inuit belief system focuses heavily on the use of miniatures as a soul-link between the object and the thing the object represents. <br/><b>Note on appropriation</b><br/>Now I'm NOT saying that we should by any means APPROPRIATE or otherwise DEVALUE these cultural systems by removing them from their original contexts without proper understanding. I am saying that we consider how similar practices to role-playing are utilized throughout the world, and how that could shift our way of thinking of our own design practices. <br/><b>Questions</b><br/>I'll leave the floor open to questions, comments, insights! I also wanted to post a a quick sketch of an idea I'd been tinkering with of role-playing-game as healing practice:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6rlSfp_flmEZk95b3BHbzV3N2s/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6rlSfp_flmEZk95b3BHbzV3N2s/view?usp=sharing</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467190/#Comment_467190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T19:13:01+00:00" title="October 23, 2017  7:13PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't read your google doc right now, but let me say that I'm intrigued by the ideas in this post.

That sounds cool, I havent been able to locate that column but I'll keep looking. Thanks for your interest!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a> I definitely can see why there's  some interest from people who like games in shamanism. I do want to restate however that I'm not suggesting that game designers <i>be</i> Shamans becuase i think that can get very very very problematic, but rather what are some potential takeaways from understanding ritual and performance that can help us understand how games can function in different and exciting ways. <br/><br/><b>Game space as liminal space</b><br/>Game spaces are sites of ritual and liminality, obviously. There's been a lot written on the ritual spaces of DnD so I won't rehash it here. What I will do is note that a game text is a codified example of liminality. You have the original experience of what it is to play the game, and then you have the rules that shape the behavior of players and what it means to exist in that space. Within that space, you have the potential for transformations, disruptions, interventions, insight, etc. Within that liminal play space you become semi disoriented as the rituals designated by the game text are interpreted by the players. <br/><br/>What I'd like to suggest we continue to think about are the kinds of interventions and disruptions that the rituals of play allow for (in addition to/beside the point of getting lost in a story, character, having fun), and how those insights/transformations etc can continue outside of and beyond the traditional circle of play (which I will here define as people sitting in a room at home).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467228/#Comment_467228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T15:29:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  3:29PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.

(roleplaying games are a tricky thing in our culture/worldview, and I find myself constantly overanalising things to see if a part of RPG life fits within my worldview)<br/><br/>This just to give a framework for saying that it's because of these things the satanic panic revolving around dnd was a thing, and in some churches still is. And this wasn't even being attempted yet by DnD.<br/><br/>Now, I do not want to convince and convert you of my religion, but I want to give a warning that a few of the big religions, especially Christianity and Islam, would be unable to participate in games with pagan elements in its design/mechanics. Which (or is it witch, hahah ... puns! ... I'll let myself out) might not be a problem for you, you may want to design a game targetting a specific sort of people, in which case I see no problem. But if you want to make games for everybody this might be a problem.<br/><br/>Another concern is that it would shift the game from play for fun/diversion/escapism to play for ... meditation/reflection/finding your place in the world, which would give it a more religious aspect. Again, if this is your intent, who am I to stop you or convince you otherwise, but it's good to keep in mind that it will fill another part of life that an evening of fun. It can overlap of course, I often have fun at church for example, but it might become more of an obligation rather than a fun thing you often/sometimes do together.<br/><br/>Or I totally missed your intent and thus missed the point with my wordy opinion.<br/>In which case, I'm sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames" title="NoctimaniaGames"><img alt="NoctimaniaGames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames">NoctimaniaGames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467263/#Comment_467263" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T15:17:20+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  3:17PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2017 3:19PM by NoctimaniaGames.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> Thanks for linking that!

I wanted to address a few of your points:<br/>1) I definitely understand what you're saying in terms of accessibility to people who are devoutly religious, my girlfriends family are pentecostal. My girlfriend herself is Christo-pagan, meaning she incorporates elements of both, so I do believe there are instances where both can co-exist. That is to say that I think you can study ritual and liminality without it having to do with anything religious. <br/><br/>2) My intention behind this thread is to generate discussions around practices that use story game structures/mechanics to curate experiences that exist outside the realm of regular escapism or the fun of gaming into the realm of personal transformative experiences, self-care, ritual insights. If both fun and self care can happen at the same time, that's good! That's the ultimate goal! <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467264/#Comment_467264" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T15:21:55+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  3:21PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/NoctimaniaGames">@NoctimaniaGames</a> You're welcome.
