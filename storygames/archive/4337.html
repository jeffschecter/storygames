It was fun.  It was a little goofy, but that ... well, that had a lot to do with dump stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rolled 4d6-best-3, free ordering (and I groused at them about how in my day it was "3d6-best-3 in the order you rolled 'em!") and three out of four players ended up with pairs (at least) of stats eight or lower.  So they were looking around for dump stats.  The dump stats they chose, universally, were INT and WIS.  Two of the players decided to play half-orcs on top of that, which really drove their brain-power down.  They adopted a "Me smash ... yes, smash good!" orc 'accent' which helped to underline their comparative lack of smarts, and generally just had a terrific good time with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had stooges.  We even had three of them.  This was not destined to be a high-brow party, nope.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorked real well for the scenario we were running through, though.  I used <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20050329a" rel="nofollow">A dark and stormy knight</a>, which is a very straight-line smash-and-loot scenario with little-to-no subtlety.  The half-orcs wanted "go in, see if there anything good inside, maybe good to eat," and that's what we did.  I'll take whatever motivation folks choose to bring to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, the party severely kicked <i>ass</i> ... I was embarrassed for the monsters.  I think there are several factors involved there:  First, the party of four decided (quite optimally) that at first level they neither wanted nor needed a magic-user, so our half-orcs were a barbarian and a ranger.  That's a lot of extra fire-power at first level, and it made a pretty thorough hash out of the monsters presented.  Also, though, I think the CRs on this adventure must have been adjusted toward the low end of the scale.  Some of the encounters (<i>two</i> hobgoblins against a party of four?) were just instantaneous splatter-fests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I really liked about the adventure, however, was that the main thread has <i>such</i> a nice progression from the mundane up to the utterly terrifying.  First we fought a swarm of rats.  Next we fought a pair of hobgoblin brigands.  Then we fought a <i>gigantic spider</i> (man, EEEW!), and then we hit our peak fighting a long-dead zombie bugbear knight from some ancient empire built on ritual sacrifice of the lesser races, and OH MY GOD, people were aware of that critter as incredibly creepy and very much a threat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice little rules thing that underlined the creepiness:  The half-orc ranger gets a natural 20 on the zombie-knight, and then rolls <i>another</i> natural 20 to confirm the crit ... and still doesn't do enough damage to take the creature down.  So I describe how he swings his battle-ax and rips open the thing's chest, bones and dried organs and dust flying everywhere ... and then the zombie keeps coming.  <i>And then</i> we remember the rules that undead are immune to critical hits, so we all go "Yep, having his spleen ripped out didn't even hurt him particularly," and I revise the hitpoints back <i>up</i> and we continue the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players applied some pretty solid tactics, given the limits of the (as I mentioned) very linear dungeon.  Our cleric saved <i>Enlarge</i> in his strength-domain slot, and burned it on the half-orc barbarian in the battle against the zombie.  A barbarian with 21 strength and a giant-sized great-axe ... does a lot of damage, very quickly.  Hooo-eee.  I loved the look on their faces when this titan of testosterone swung, did eighteen HP of damage, and I nodded and said "And then the zombie moves forward..." and they were all like "OH SHIT!  It's STILL MOVING!"  But even a zombie can't take too many hits like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zombie came within <i>one point</i> of confirming a critical on the barbarian in return, though ... even after the AC modifiers for the enlarge (which had everyone worried) the confirm was 11 to the 12 needed.  Which was, y'know, good for the barbarian as she barely survived that one normal shot, and would have been (in her words) "salsa" if it had been twice as much damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amused and vaguely horrified (though not surprised) that the party, rather than "risk" travelling back out to the outside in order to rest, half-barricaded the open door-way and hunkered down in the <i>unholy tomb</i> with the dessicated remains of the zombie in order to pass the night (and let the cleric recharge his Shiny-God-hands).  It was getting late (real-world), but I did want to point out how strange and counter-intuitive that was ... and I happened to have a vargouille, recently freed from long captivity, still in the dungeon somewhere.  So I had it drop by to visit the thief on his watch.  It actually got the drop on him, so he goes from "Hey, I don't remember that hideous head-sculpture on the table barricading the doorway" directly to "OH GOD IT'S ALIVE!  SWEET GOD GET IT OFF OF ME!" (which was gratifying).  Still ... AC12, 5HP, and everybody saved against its paralyzing shriek.  Vargouille salsa.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny moment:  So the thief says "That's it, I've been on watch enough," and the ranger says "Me watch.  You sleep."  And then, because the ranger (being a half-orc) has darkvision he promptly douses the lantern.  We realize that we've got the thief, who <i>just</i> had this strange vargouille thing all up in his face, and he's suddenly plunged into pitch darkness and told "Get some rest."  The player did a very good job of curling into a fetal ball in his chair and shuddering as he said "Oh yeah, I'm gonna sleep REAL WELL."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the "morning" they were sitting there (the three stooges, with the unseeing (but wise!) cleric trying to guide them) trying to get the half-orcs who could <i>see</i> the lantern to get it into the hands of the thief who could <i>light</i> it.  We decided (by unanimous consensus) that the ranger would play a "joke" on the thief by saying "Okay, here lantern" and then handing him the splattered vargouille head instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thief doesn't want to adventure with half-orcs any more.  Was good joke.  Very funny.  Him just got no sense humor.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97781/#Comment_97781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T08:04:37+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  8:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a great time!\n<blockquote>The players applied some pretty solid tactics, given the limits of the (as I mentioned) very linear dungeon.</blockquote>\nCould you elaborate on these?

We used dice for figures, pencils and erasers for walls and obstacles, so we had a sorta-kinda battle-grid going on (important for flanking and attacks of opportunity).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill ... it's a very linear dungeon, which means that the battles are all linear affairs:  You come in one door, the bad guys are either already in the room or come in another door, you proceed toward each other and jostle, rugby-style, in the middle.  I want our next scenario to be more tactically interesting:  I'm thinking that a local village is being oppressed by bandits who have fortified an old ruined manor complex in the hills overlooking the town.  Then you've got rooftops (crumbling) to work with, you've got walls and openings in those walls, you've got multiple buildings, lines of sight, <i>plus</i> what the players described (when I mentioned it to them) as the "small force problem" ... having a force that's sufficient to take on the mass of people, but only so long as they can pick them off in small groups.  Stealth and rapid, quiet combat becomes much more of an issue.  All told, I think our group would be interested in giving the wargaming side of the rules much more of a workout.<br/>\n<br/>\nXP:  Haven't totalled it up.  Folks seemed reasonably happy with their character choices, but I didn't sense a lot of investment.  Eric was talking about making "another rogue" rather than continuing with the one he has.  I think we're all basically assuming that we'll start from scratch with whoever happens to come to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97790/#Comment_97790" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T08:18:17+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  8:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just read the module and the masterwork weapon thing stood out for me - "Figure out who in your party doesn't have a masterwork weapon.

I don't have the book here with me, but yeah, you don't just say "There's some barrels. Over there is a rocky outcropping. Here is an arch."  You say, "Here is an arch. If you're within 5 feet of it you get a +5 to all sneak/hide rolls because of the shadow it casts. There is a outcropping. It is a DC 15 to climb that wall, but if you get to the top you'll have +3 to arrow attacks", etc: And you (DM) make up all those DCs and bonuses and "tricks", even if they interfere or bend rules that elsewhere in other books ("But the DMG suggests that open cover gives you only a +x when firing from a higher vantage point"  "Fuck the DMG, I say that THIS hill gives you a +7!!".

It was such a great laugh-out-loud moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're instructed, by the module, to herd people into this entry hall with three doors.  So I do that, and everyone's like "Absolutely!  Entry to the dungeon?  All we needed was an excuse ... not even that, really."  Naturally, the first thing they do is try the doors.  Time to <i>delve</i>, my lovelies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe doors are locked.  Well, they have a rogue!  Lock-picking difficulty (listed in the module) DC30.  Okay.  That's not gonna happen.  We do a little bit of narration of the thief trying to get past the rusted locks, and saying "No way, no how.  They're solid as a tree, and not budging an inch."<br/>\n<br/>\nNo <i>problem!</i>  They have a big strong half-orc.  Break door DC (listed in the module) DC28.  Uh.  Okay.  That's not gonna happen.  Some more narration ... the doors are four inches thick (<i>listed in the module</i>) and they're clearly really powerfully built and attached, even after centuries.  MAN.  They built these things to last.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I know what's coming next, and before they get into too much of a hassle about trying to <i>burn</i> the doors down, or chop them apart with an axe, or whatever ... I skip into the next description.  And then, halfway down, I choke up laughing, and need to gasp for a few minutes before I finish.  Because the description <i>ends</i> as follows:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The doors leading into the tor, however, do show signs of weakness, seeming to tremble with every thunderclap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, in conjunction with a particularly loud thunderclap, all three doors break open at once, falling from their doorways into the room with a great cacophony.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI don't really think that this bit was <i>intentionally</i> added to increase the entertainment value of the module.  It seems a pretty straight-up module in most ways.  But man, that had some pretty powerful laugh value for us right then.  The mismatch between the listed stats for these doors and their being narrated as being knocked down <i>by a loud noise</i> ... well, maybe you just had to be there, but we found it pretty damn funny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97838/#Comment_97838" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T10:32:52+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 10:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite D&amp;D module door story was when I was reading the description for a door in a pamphlet module, one of those little 'evening of play' things that a bunch of companies put out early in the 3.0 boom.<br><br>The room description said "There are exploding runes on the north door."<br><br>Then I realized there was no north door.<br><br>And noplace for a north door to go if there was a north door.<br><br>And that there was not even a northernmost door.<br><br>The result of my realization was, as my wife described it, "Ragabash rage."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97839/#Comment_97839" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T10:33:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 10:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you see, sound waves can, if they're set up in harmonic sympathy with the wavelength of the door, cause the door to suddenly vibrate in such a way as to take advantage of certain structural integrity issues that simply smashing into them would not.

There was a big hill that gave us no real reason to investigate it...except that it was "the module".  <br><br>What kicked it up from mundane lame design to utter hilarity was that given that we were being railroaded into going through those doors, did the designers then let us could go in when we tried?  No.  They had them impossible to get through except when the module-preordained event opened them for us.  That is a level of control freak behavior that is just so pathetic that it is sublime.  "You must go through the doors...but not until I condescend to let you through!"<br><br>In general, this was not the best module in which to play a first level rogue.  There was nothing thiefly to do and the fighter types hacked their way through the monsters very quickly.

If there were originally some sort of riddle ensconced in that room, which would let people get through the doors <i>on their own effort</i> then it would make sense to highlight the riddle by cutting off the other ways of bypassing the doors.  Now, suppose you're playtesting and you realize "Oh shit, this riddle is boring people out of their skins," and so you remove it ... but you forget that you probably also want to re-stat the doors.  You'd get exactly the same mismatch between the strength of the doors and the description of their collapse, all without any deliberate motive.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, I honestly wasn't hoping to jump up and down on the issue, or make any sort of philosophic attack on the module, the author, or D&amp;D; generally.  I just thought it was pretty freakin' funny in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97851/#Comment_97851" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T11:08:21+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 11:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 11:08AM by TonyLB.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheCzech</cite>In general, this was not the best module in which to play a first level rogue.
