That's not <i>bad</i>, because it's doing something different from IGD, but it's not what I want.<br/><br/>The RPG Laboratory is something different entirely. And it's very difficult to design games here.<br/><br/>See, there's lots of sites that let you design games. Someone will mention Gamecraft in a moment.

I imagine it's inescapable. <br/><br/>Rather than jump from one forum to another, I've recently decided I need to abuse the relationships I've formed at conventions and directly ask the designers whose work I appreciate for a quick review of a (clearly stated) element of my work in progress. Fair warning to you poor fools who greet me by my first name. My own work is too far along to introduce in a post that stays shy of the ramblers I FF through myself.<br/><br/>Of course, this relies on getting well past the "woodshedding" phases and having some actual content to present but First Ideas should be fine for that. Once the game is too complex to fit in First Ideas, get it to people you trust for detailed inspection and thrashing. <br/><br/>I was watching the M dot Strange film school videos and one of my favorite suggestions was to stay far away from the internet with an immature idea. Your friends and acquaintances should be your audience at that stage. If they offer you level, objective criticism, great. If they praise you, you've got the inflated ego to survive a few trolls. If they beat you down, you develop a thick skin.

I equate this to two issues (not specific to the Forge):<br/>First, It got too popular.  I suspect a smaller audience is far easier to listen to then a larger one.  I have though about running a design symposium where you go for answers and you get only a handful of people that can actually respond to posts.  This way the feedback is directed and informed.<br/><br/>The danger is that these people may get their heads stuck in one place and talk from a single theory or idea instead of maybe approaching things from a broad, accepting and experimental stance.<br/><br/>Second, everyone wants Vincent or Clinton to answer their posts.  I can only assume that although flattering and interesting, answering forums posts are not their full time job and could get overwhelming quickly (if not jaded) and two it would be hard to get new blood into the mix.  A symposium - a council, so to speak - would have to rotate through different people and maybe have a process by which you're admitted.  On one hand I like to be among the noise throwing out my ideas and maybe even see them being used.  On the other hand I don't want to be from someone I don't know for him to tell me that I should scrap my game and make it d20 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's a fine balancing act that I think every popular forum eventually degrades to.  I like the idea of a community that you have to be invited into, personally.  Especially if you have to be invited in person!!!  That would be so hot!  Please don't misunderstand I am not saying that's what THIS should be.

I liked the work ethic.</blockquote>\nHonestly, the work ethic, for me, always came hand-in-hand with a kind of stridency in discourse that I found distasteful.  It's why I never did more than dip a toe in around there.  So:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Is it just me or does anyone get the same thing?</blockquote>\nWell, clearly it's not just you, but it was never me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

If Ron would rather spend his time helping people make their games better in AP threads, that's totally cool.  I think it's great to have a lot of people in the FT forum that aren't necessarily experts on forge theory but bring interesting views and misunderstandings with them.  It's been really beneficial to my own ideas when I put myself on the spot and have to decide why I disagree with the advice someone else has given.<br/><br/>I can understand why a lot of the new First Thoughts posts may be boring to people who posted in Indie Games Design for years.  But, just skimming through those old threads, I don't think the ideas people were coming up with then were any better (though Clinton might disagree with me there) or received any better feedback.  <br/><br/>And I don't think people enter the forums with any less work ethic these days.

I'm just saying that, if there is a recent trend toward newbies not having the same online collaborative work ethic of old, which some on here suggest, I haven't seen it.  Then again, I don't have the privileged vantage point of someone that was there or is well-connected in the scene today.  All I have to look at is the archived IGD forum.<br/><br/>I know it's a sensitive subject, but maybe someone could PM me examples/opinions?  I'm not trying to be combative.  This is not a matter of calling anyone to the carpet.  In part, I want to know what we posters in the FT forum can do to make it more like the IGD forum, back in its glory days - that is, if you can explain what made them the glory days.  <br/><br/>As an aside, a little math reveals there is a bit of a drop in the average posts per year and average threads per year from IGD to that of FT.   This could just be a side-effect of splitting up IGD in two, but who knows.  <br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124796/#Comment_124796" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T12:18:19+00:00" title="February  6, 2008 12:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, is the problem who can respond, or is it who can post new topics?
