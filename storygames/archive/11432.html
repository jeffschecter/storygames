I plan on releasing a barebones free playtest pdf of the rules, and then coming out with new content on a biweekly basis. The new content will consist of treasure, monsters, maps, NPCs, and rules plug-ins. At this time, I plan on releasing everything for free, and then publishing and selling print copies of what's on the website (which are a hell of a lot more convenient then having gobs of pdfs, and website printouts).<br/><br/>Now, my problem. As it sits now, the game will heavily utilize cards. Treasure, antagonists, class abilities and the like where all going to be card-based. My reasoning is that I want the different pieces of the game (the cards and character sheet) to contain all of the instructional content necessary to use that particular thing. So, if a weapon or character ability has a specific type of rule associated with it, then the instructions for it will be on its card. <br/><br/>In my game, there are a few different kinds of treasure: 3 different types of resources (Food, Fuel, Scrap), and a general 'Equipment' category. <br/><br/>My original plan was to have a treasure deck that people draw from. The deck will include some cards that just say \u2018Food\u2019, \u2018Fuel\u2019, or \u2018Scrap\u2019. The idea is that they would represent one abstract unit of that sort of treasure. Equipment would be represented in various categories (like a \u2018machine gun' card, or a \u2018medium armor\u2019 card), along with other cards that just say \u2018Upgrade\u2019 that can be spent on improving your items; the rules for which will be indicated on item cards. As an example, this is the kind of information that would be contained on a weapon card:<br/><br/>=============================<br/>ARES 45PX<br/>Type: Pistol<br/>Range: 1                 []2           []3<br/>Damage: 1/+1         []2/+1      []3/+1<br/>Traits: Dual- You can wield two pistols at once, and split your AD and weapon skill dice between two separate shots. The two shots can be fired at one target, or two different ones.<br/>[] Scope- add two extra attack dice at the longest range category for the weapon. Single shot only.<br/>[] Shock- spend one hit to decrease the target\u2019s AD by one for the following round. <br/>[] Punishing- when all of your attack dice come up as hits, deal +1 bonus damage per die.<br/>==================================<br/> <br/>The little boxes in the above profile would be things you would spend upgrades on. For example, if I had that gun, and an upgrade card, I could spend it to increase the Range to 2, or give it the \u2018Shock\u2019 trait. The upgrade card would then be discarded back into the treasure deck.<br/><br/>Vehicles, armor, and other items work similarly to weapons, though will probably shake out to be a little simpler.<br/><br/>Now, my problem comes with how to generate treasure in the first place. I want there to be a wide variety of different types of weapons and equipment. Obviously, that would mean both typing up and creating a metric crapload of cards like the one above. I could release them serially, like I planned, but my other concern is trying to find a way to create large quantities of that sort of product, and allow the treasure deck to be expanded upon.<br/><br/>My secondary idea was to make a whole bunch of treasure charts that you roll on, rather than a treasure deck. Food, Fuel, and Scrap would be kept track of by using different-colored tokens. I would then provide blank weapon and equipment template cards that players could fill in with the randomly generated info on the chart. (I would actually probably provide blank cards anyway, to encourage players and GMs to make their own items to begin with). My worry with this secondary method is the increased handling time with having to roll on treasure tables and fill out cards EVERY TIME you loot something.<br/><br/>This second option leaves a bad taste in my mouth; it kinda flies in the face of having both the simple randomizer of a card draw and all of the rules for an item listed out right in front of you.<br/><br/>Does the above make sense? What are your thoughts? Is there another alternative that I might be overlooking?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254502/#Comment_254502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T11:23:05+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 11:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have nothing against a metric crapton of cards, and if that's your vision, you should probably go with it.<br/><br/>Is your difficulty in generating the stats, or the physical cards? I mave a few suggestions for the latter.<br/><br/>You can get sheets of perforated business cards from any stationary store. Avery, for example, makes a couple different styles. You can download templates online to make documents that print out on the cards. This has the added benefit that you can package the doc as a PDF and it's relatively easy for people to print out at the other end.<br/><br/>A similar option would be to make PDFs yourself and expect people to print and cut them out.<br/><br/>If you're thinking of making cards and distributing the cards, I've heard that <a href="http://www.guildofblades.com/podcards.php" rel="nofollow">Guild of Blades</a> has a good card POD model going. Might be worth checking out.<br/><br/>I know at least one person who built an Access database to hold their cards, allowing them to do some kind of document merge to automatically generate the documents for printing. That's much better from a content management standpoint, but a little trickier on the tech side. There's software out there for building collectible card games too. Some of it might be free of charge. There was at least one free solution when I looked at building a card game a few years ago. It was mediocre, but it made it easier to define a common set of background art across cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254503/#Comment_254503" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T11:27:42+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 11:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br/><br/>I was talking about finding an easy way to generate the physical cards, and allow other people to get them without it being a total pain in the ass.
