I shipped 175 of each out to my sales guy last week and this week he wants 100 more of each title. That will leave me 25 copies for Gen Con (which is generally enough in my experience). Very cool! I've never had a game sell this fast. Now this isn't actual play yet, but it's a hell  of a lot closer to play than having the boxes sitting in my garage. I'll do a reorder after Gen Con.<br/><br/>Very cool.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
