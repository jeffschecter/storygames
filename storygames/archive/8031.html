Right now, my only outlet for anything "strange" (something other than D&amp;D; or a White Wolf clone) is playing something with my wife. Beast Hunters seems like an intriguing bit, so I went ahead and ordered it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, from the poking around I've done it seems like the advice for making more... stuff... is "Look at what's already there and use that as a guideline". Straight forward enough and the sort of thing I tend to do when messing around with a game anyway. However, it seemed like there were some hints at some more formal suggestions that were in the process of being created. Did that ever happen? If so, anyone happen to have a link to it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, anyone happen to spend some time making up stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got any suggestions for "gotchas" to watch out for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've already searched Story Games as best as possible and found a bit about conflicts possibly taking too long as well as some intriguing looking accounts of how the game worked out in general. However, any other cool stories or what not are quite welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177525/#Comment_177525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T06:30:19+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  6:30AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there!  Thanks for checking out Beast Hunters.<br><br>When you say "stuff," do you  mean... setting details?  Adventure seeds?  Beasts?  Conversions?  Or something else?<br><br>There are links to some more AP reports <a href="http://www.berengad.com" rel="nofollow">on our web site</a>, along with helpful things like a cheat sheet for conflicts that Brand made.<br><br>As for the length of conflicts, it turns out that many people are more stingy with AP offers than I am, so you can either up your offers or, if you want to make the game more dangerous, lower the cost for strikes.  A suggestion I've heard, and successfully tried myself for multiplayer games at cons that have to go faster, is to charge 4 AP for each D6 for strikes.<br><br>Just let me know if you've got any other questions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177551/#Comment_177551" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T08:27:16+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  8:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/%25%5E">@%^</a><a href="/forums/profile/%23%24%25%5E">@#$%^</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHad a nice long reply typed out and apparently timed out... usually I copy my post before submitting, just in case of such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pretty vague because I was curious to see what (if anything) folks offered up. Since you're asking for specifics...<br/>\n<br/>\nBeasts, and Tattoos mainly I suppose. My wife really enjoys the "traditional" stuff right now (killing things and taking their stuff), but with some of the more "modern" sensibilities; PDQ (Zorcerer of Zo and Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies) are our "go to" games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we (I) plan on doing Beast Hunters straight up, having an idea how the beasts and tattoos are built/balanced will make doing something like a D&amp;D; flavored Beast Hunters game or maybe "Sith Hunters" easier to pull off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's always interesting to see how something as "basic" or "typical" as stuff like D&amp;D; magic or gear or what not winds up morphing when the system itself is changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177557/#Comment_177557" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T08:52:17+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  8:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to making up beasts and such, Mo and I started making up beasts specifically to present challenges and give tattoos that would play thematically into the things going on in the character's lives. From the theme of the monster we'd work backwards to what it actually looked like and did. <br><br>For example, at one point my character murdered a shaman of another nandan. He was torn up about it inside, but as a master of denial was putting on a stoic face about it, lying to everyone he knew about what happened and how it made him feel. We decided he should get a tattoo that would let him talk to ghosts, and Mo wanted a beast that was, basically, a liar and deceiver. From there she made up a beast much like the displacer beast from D&amp;D (though when I later said, "It was a displacer beast" she didn't know what I meant -- parallel development is funny) that always looked like it was in a place other than where it was, and that only manifested in the physical world at dawn and dusk, the rest of the time it stalked its prey in the spirit world. There were lots of challenges around lore and dream combat and friends being attacked and a final fight that was really, really fucking brutal. And once I had the tattoo it turned out I was haunted by the ghost of the shaman I had killed, and she was going to be with me no matter where I ran. <br><br>Around the same time Mo's character was starting to face the idea that as a hunter she might not be able to be a normal part of her tribe anymore -- a concept that was difficult for her because she was a chieftain's daughter, and was raised to be chieftain herself someday. So the beast I made for her was a kind of Ur-Bear that had been worshiped in secret by her tribe (the Bear tribe, natch) for generations, and which they occasionally used rituals and blood trails to turn against rival tribes. When confronted with the beast she had to decide whether to go with her tribe and let a terrible beast live, or try to kill it and thus put her status with her tribe in dire jeopardy. (One should not kill one's totem, after all.) After the quest we decided together than the tattoo should have something to do with standing alone. I don't remember the details of what we worked out, but it limited the amount of damage or attacks that multiple attackers could make -- so that folks wanting to face you were better off doing it one on one than in a group. <br><br>Her character then decided to stay with the tribe, of course, fighting to keep her old life even in the face of her growing alienation. She's difficult like that. <br><br>Oh, one other thing we did, is that we decided early on that both our characters had the same hunter mentor. So that way when they'd go back to him to get tattooed they'd meet at his camp and the PCs would have some time to talk to each other about what had happened and what was going on in their world. The camp was a neutral ground in the world, so there was no need for us to GM much of anything, and it let us play our PCs together from time to time, while they went widely apart for the actual adventures. It was fun.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
