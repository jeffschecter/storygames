It's set in the present day, in and around a small town. Outside town, at the point where the urban sprawl has almost faded into the rural landscape, there is a cult compound. The game's starting point is the tension between members of the cult and their neighbours in the town who are becoming suspicious of their activities. <br/><br/>Weirdly, as I was writing, Chris Goodwin posted a link in the Stuff to Watch thread, about Rancho Rajneesh in Oregon which completely epitomises the sort of material the game covers:\n<blockquote>Ma Anand Puja stepped into St. Vincent Hospital on a summer night in 1985, hunting for James Comini.<br/><br/>The Filipino nurse was there to kill the rural Oregon politician, who was recuperating from ear surgery at the Portland hospital. She carried a syringe to inject a mixture into Comini's intravenous tube that would stop his heart.<br/><br/>But once inside Comini's seventh-floor isolation room, Puja discovered her target wasn't on an IV. Flustered, she hurried from the hospital to a getaway car, and her assassination team started the long drive home.<br/><br/>Their destination: Rancho Rajneesh, a spiritual encampment 200 miles away in eastern Oregon. It was base for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a guru from India, and 2,000 of his worshippers.</blockquote>\nHere\u2019s why you\u2019d play this game: you\u2019ll be exploring what happens to people under pressure, who are in a genuinely crazy situation. <br/><br/>It's a situation filled with difficult tensions \u2013 loyalty conflicts, the need for self-preservation conflicting with your religious beliefs, and family members who want to rescue people who are happy right where they are. It's about the damage that people do to themselves in order to stay in a community they think they love, and the difficult responsibility of thinking and acting independently.<br/><br/>'The Cult on the Outskirts of Town' is a game about psychological conflict, where what\u2019s at stake is character change and the possibility that you won\u2019t be the same person when you wake up in the morning.<br/><br/>And it\u2019s a game where characters may very well be doomed, and events will end in tragedy.<br/><br/>If you want to find out what happens to these people, then this is a game for you.<br/><br/>The Cult on the Outskirts of Town (working title) is a mash-up of Matthijs Holter's <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a> and Levi Kornelsen's <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/the-exchange" rel="nofollow">The Exchange</a>.

This looks cool! You owe me one game of Nicotene Girls, and one of this (oh! and Left Coast too please!).<br/><br/>I've only skimmed it because Google Doces was being a dork, but it looks exciting.<br/><br/>A couple of things:<br/><br/>I wonder if you could come up with a "Cult Generation System", like Towns in Dogs. I ask because I think the game might have a lot more emotional power if the cults are founded on principles the players all really believe in, but in execution have gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Similarly, I think some specific questions about shared history might be cool. One of the things I always find really tragic about cults is how they often start with idealistic people with strong relationships, and those relationships destroy them.<br/><br/>You're using a fairly specific initial situation, and I think that gives you the opportunity to make fairly specific requirements of characters.
