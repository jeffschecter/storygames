So:<br/><br/>I can think of a few different roles that NPCs fill - would welcome any others from the many experienced GMs here. <br/><br/>The Villain, obviously, and The Villain's Henchpersons.<br/>The Obstacles - not villains as such, just difficulties in the way of the PCs' agenda/tests on the way to the Great Test.<br/>The Guide.<br/>The Helper - doesn't just guide and give information but gives some kind of logistical support, without being actually a main character with a clear separate agenda.<br/>The Mission Briefer, who sets up the scenario.<br/>The Walk-on Incidental Infodump.<br/>The Comic Relief.<br/>The Lust Interest.<br/>The Foil, who points up some aspect of one or more PCs by comparison or contrast.<br/>The McGuffin, who might as well be a Maltese falcon - their only role is to get rescued.<br/>The Nameless Victims, who engage sympathy with their suffering.<br/>The Named Victims, who were valued by the PCs and provoke them to vengeance.<br/>The Means to an End - someone who knows something, has something, can do something or has authority to command something that the PCs need.<br/>The Furniture (the kind who get credits like "Man in street" or "Woman #2").<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this; it may or may not end up in the game text. At the moment it's just part of my random brainstorming to show me possibilities.<br/><br/>There are probably lists of standard story roles somewhere - links to such are welcome too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75229/#Comment_75229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T21:18:21+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  9:18PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Point of View character - in other words, the guy who asks all the questions the audience (players?) want to ask and needs things explained to him a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75234/#Comment_75234" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T22:30:50+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 10:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Chorus - the character(s) who cite the events of the story to keep things moving and help everyone be on the same page.

You take an element of your story, and you say, "I want this element to have a stronger tie to the human experience," and so you make that element a human being (more or less).<br/><br/>So, for example, we need a situation.  If we want a more <em>human</em> situation, we use NPCs to establish the situation.  When looking through the lists above my post, I just kept thinking "hmm, that looks like an establishment of result, or an enabler of action, or blah blah blah," so I think it's useful to be aware of that level.<br/><br/>At least, that's kinda my thinking on the matter.  It's an interesting thing I'll have to think about some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75262/#Comment_75262" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T04:10:50+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  4:10AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, uh, I like to apply analysis to things.

Supporting characters are "directed" by players and (generally) "played" by other players (so if you have a supporting character that's particularly important to you, you aren't talking to yourself when you interact with him/her). NPCs in the classic sense are directed and played by the GM.<br/><br/>By "directed" I mean pretty much the stage or film sense of "direction": you tell the actors, in general terms, what you want them to do.<br/><br/>Mule/Eric, thanks for the insight, which totally fits with the direction I'm taking my design in: Supporting characters are there to provide handles on the setting and situation, so that the PCs can interact with (and change) them via a human interaction rather than something more abstract. Not "I'm opposing Lunar Asterism" but "I'm having a conflict with this Lunar Asterist priest right here, right now."<br/><br/>Thinking about this some more on the way home last night, I also realized that you can group these roles together into higher-level functions. NPCs provide:<br/><br/>- Information<br/>- Motivation ("Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi!")<br/>- Reflection (this is the holds-up-a-mirror thing)<br/>- Resources and means (which could include information)<br/>- Challenge<br/>- Colour<br/><br/>Anything that doesn't fit into those general categories that you can think of?<br/><br/>(Of course, the same NPC can provide more than one of these. A D&amp;D NPC, for example, provides challenge while you're killing him, and resources when you take his stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
