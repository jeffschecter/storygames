The Little Black Books were my introduction to roleplaying along with Chivalry &amp; Sorcery. I recommend that you also get <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/item.html?id=FFE001" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and the companion reprint paper volumes, while they're still available. The linked one is especially useful as it contains all the core rulebooks.<br/><br/>I would also highly recommend that you either get <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/item.html?id=FFE002" rel="nofollow">this reprint</a> volume: Citizens Of The Imperium is the gem in this collection, but there are other useful items (a host of animal designs, patrons, starship designs, and so on).<br/><br/>The Short Adventures compendium is also, apparently, still available from SJG, but the Adventures book looks not to be. Maybe you can find it from another source.<br/><br/>If you wanted to "run a Classic Traveller campaign out of the box", then I'd recommend those four reprint volumes (the two linked, plus Adventures and Short Adventures). That would keep you playing for a long, long time.<br/><br/>If you don't mind PDF, you can get the entire LBB canon (rulebooks, supplements, adventures, short adventures) on CD-ROM for I think 35USD, from farfuture.net.

It might also have come with the first adventure (Kinunir), but I somehow don't think so. Rather, perhaps it came with an introductory adventure called "Gateway to Adventure" or something similar?<br/><br/>The classic little-black-box was sized to fit the foldover 5.5x8.5 size and contained only Books 1, 2, and 3. It had enough space to spare that you could also cram it with additional LBBs.<br/><br/>Many of the Classic Traveller compatible "games" and other rules-sets also came in the little black box format: Striker, Mayday, Snapshot.<br/><br/>The LBB concept was quite possibly the best bit of product design ever seen in the roleplaying hobby with one tragic flaw. Since the LBBs were essentially simple foldover and saddle-stitch booklets of standard US Letter pages they were tremendously susceptible to photocopying: often it was cheaper to photocopy the booklets than it was to actually purchase them from the store.<br/><br/>Still, the product design was elegant, simple, unadorned, and tremendously effective: just look at the nostalgic warmth that the LBB line stirs up in hobbyists to this day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71293/#Comment_71293" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T05:42:35+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  5:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'm really not interested in any supplements or setting material that came after it.<br/>I'm curious about what is in that lone box.</blockquote>\nIf you're not interested in playing that game, that's cool. However, if you were interested in actual play, then I'd highly recommend that you at bare minimum get a copy of the "Citizens of the Imperium" supplement. The character options in the basic game are weighted heavily towards ex-military types, which is fine, but "Citizens of the Imperium" expands the Other career path from the basic books into a set of civilian career paths suitable for adventure. These options add a great deal to the palette available to the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71296/#Comment_71296" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T05:51:45+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  5:51AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally found the ex-military bias of the game to be a fundamental aspect of the flavor, way back when.  The fact that you could only climb the social ladder to its highest heights in the Navy, for example, or that the Scouts let veterans be the caretakers of multi-million-credit starships, said volumes to me about what the universe was like.  We definitely saw the Imperium to be something akin to the 18th and 19th century British Empire, and since our favorite services were Marines and Scouts, we were fairly Republican (in the British sense of the term) in our outlook... which we decided put us on the wrong side of the hierarchy.  The Navy was our enemy as often as not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson" title="Olle Jonsson"><img alt="Olle Jonsson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://olle.1av10.nu/pics/site/face.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson">Olle Jonsson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71308/#Comment_71308" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T06:23:59+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  6:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Vaxalon: Thanks for clarifying that aspect of the Traveller world-view.

Your game will involve a group of misfit ex-military types with a beat-up secondhand starship getting into scrapes on randomly generated planets. It will rely almost entirely on your skill in generating fun color out of abstract strings of numbers, freeforming character interaction, and avoiding the absurdly deadly combat rules. It may be a great deal of fun.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, if you want to try it, I recommend you use one of the several "random sector generator" programs out there, build yourself a bunch of worlds, and go.

Right now I don't have the d20 edition, or a couple of recent things. I've stopped finally collecting material for a game that I may never play again. I might be obsessed with it, so, predictably, what's below is long. You have been warned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a great fondness for Traveller, but I think that's despite the fact that play was always troublesome. It's definitely one of those games I look back on now and think how it's design was problematic for play. Consider it's source, to start. Like D&amp;D;, it comes very directly from a wargaming background. In fact, books 1-3 have more in them about how to do them as miniatures battles than they do on how to roleplay adventures at all. It's a fascinating read in that respect. As it happens I went back and re-read them a couple of months ago, and I was really stunned by just how... well, primitive is the only word that I think applies... how primitive they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting is that, for the time, the layout was really advanced in a way. That is, compared to other products when those first three books came out, Traveller looks relatively professional. Very clean lines, for instance. It's only once you start reading the text that you start to see that it's just like a lot of other RPGs from the era. That is, it tells you how to do certain operations, but not how to put it all together into a coherent game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter the modules. The adventures were very instrumental in teaching how to play this RPG, as can be said of most modules of the time. But, since you're trying to get a sense of what play is like coming solely from the set you have, I won't go into what the modules indicated for play. They were some of the earliest stabs at plot-driven play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books, however... well, let's break it down. The first book tells you essentially how to make characters, as the title would indicate. As people have mentioned, it's a "lifepath" system, but only insamuch as you have the character choose a profession, and then you see what they get while they were in that profession. In book 4 and later, this would become much more complex, and there were some actual branching choices you could make (notably about college and such).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut before that, the "lifepath" portion is a pretty simple process:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Choose military arm (or "other")<br/>\n2. Roll to see if you can get in. If you fail, roll randomly to see which service drafts you.<br/>\n3. Roll to see what happens to the character during the term of service (including things like promotion, and what skills/abilities the character gains).<br/>\n4. Roll to see if he survives. If not, go back to 1, and try again.<br/>\n5. Roll to see whether or not the character can/must re-enlist. After a while you have the option to "muster out." Earlier, if you make your roll to re-enlist, you must stay in. If you re-enlist, go back to 3.<br/>\n6. When you fail a re-enlistment roll, or choose to have the character end his carreer in the military, you then roll on the "mustering out" tables to see what benefits his military career has brought him in terms of assets and statistical benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the character is then done. Basicaly you end up with 6 stats, a short list of abilities that you've accumulated, the characters age, and some cash and other material benefits (weapons, passage vouchers, starship, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting about this is that, when generating a "party" of characters, there's only one centralizing concept that you can shoot for, which is to try to ensure that some character has a starship. The idea then being that the characters will then crew the starship. If the characters are finished, and no starship is to be had from chargen, then you're left with a group of characters likely from differing military backgrounds that all happened to retire at the same time, and who are going to hang around with each other apparently because they're all unemployed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're 11 years old, and this is what you're given to start... well, it's not good. Even with the starship, however, it's not really much better. But, in practice what happens is that players refuse to play certain characters that they generate. Like the character who misses his re-enlistment roll the first time, and musters out at 22 with only Rifle-1 and Admin-1 as his only skills, and a low passage for assets. Looking back on it now, I love that idea for a character... a young man, no prospects, hardly any applicable skill, a whole universe before him, and all he has is one starship ride to another planet in cryosleep to get him somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, I could play the hell out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in those days, play wasn't about such things. It was about what was in the rest of the books. Starships and starship commerce, and killing things. To hit the latter idea first, not only did Traveller include a combat system, but, again, it was more than perfunctory. Look for old games named Striker and Snapshot. These followed directly on about the same time as the boxed edition you have, and were the actual miniatures combat rules for ground combat and boarding actions respectively. From that perspective alone, you can see what the game is angling for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut looking again back at the first three books, what you'll see is that it does mention the idea of the characters being mercenaries as one way to play. This makes sense. Why else have the lifepath system do all military backgrounds and kludge everything else into "other"? You can imagine Marc Miller sitting there and thinking, "What sort of combat do you see in sci-fi books, where the characters are not in the military (and thus able to control their own destinies)? Aha! Mercenaries!"<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, the three books don't support this concept well out of the box. Miller is obviously thinking that the players in question will be people like himself, ex-military perhaps, but certainly wargamers who understand the idea of military campaigns and mercenaries and how they operate. Such that the players will be able to come up with military scenarios to be played out by the characters. There's some slight support for this in the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't have that background, however, then the mercenary thing is not all that viable. If you doubt that playing mercenaries is one of the primary modes of play, however, then I offer as proof Book 4: Mercenaries. By the time you get to this first primary rules supplement, it's pretty darn clear that this is what play is supposed to be about for many groups. That book does provide quite a lot of support for playing this sort of "campaign."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, the first three books really don't support this all this well, relying on player knowledge of such things to get them going. Which leaves only one really viable road left to present itself to the players, starship crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, again, if play starts without the players having a starship, one of two things tends to happen. Either they refuse to play one or more of the characters generated, rolling until they get a merchant or scout character with a ship. Or they steal a starship.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds pretty specific, I know. But consider what's in the rulebooks. If you don't have a starship, you're not using one third of the rules of the game. In fact some times play will go on with the party grounded without a ship for a while. But the other interesting phenomenon here is that, if this is the case, then the group almost always begins a life of crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71613/#Comment_71613" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T06:38:38+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  6:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 6:50AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... there are biases at work here that I should explain. First, yeah, when I started playing Traveller I was pretty young. Like 11. Maybe I just didn't know enough about life to have play go any other way? Or at least my friends playing? But I found that in play even into my 20s that crime always remained a staple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may be because of bias 2, which is the published adventures. I mean... OK... here's a stable star empire, with a legitimate government for all we know to start (I'll get back to this in a moment). You have characters who are not mercenaries, but looking for employment. And we want to make play exciting. Hmm. Well, they can just get normal jobs, sure. In fact, I did at one point play a character in another kid's game that was, effectively, a stock-broker. By just rolling dice on stock trades, he quickly became a gazillionaire, and then... well we got bored with him getting rich as a form of play. Eventually there has to be some conflict, and probably something where you will have to use weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that means basically one of two things. Either your job is to guard something against people acting illegally. Or your job is to do something illegal, so you might get shot at. Often a little of both. Almost all published Traveller adventures have one of these two elements in them. If you stick to doing bodyguard work, eventually the idea comes into the characters heads that it might be fun for them to be the criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd eventually they steal a starship if they can't get one by legitimate means. Now, how practical this is, is not clear from the rules in books 1-3. Later it's actually very hard. But space is large, so we can assume that the characters can, like pirates, find some place to hide. But then... what do they do for employment? This is where the Pirates campaign starts. They're outlaws now, and the most fantastically expensive items in the game are starships. And so begins the quest to own ever bigger and more powerful starships in order to capture more and larger prizes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot done with the biases yet, the third, and maybe most important, is the source material. Namely Star Wars. Oh, sure, you've read tons of other sci-fi, and seen other movies. But, c'mon, who doesn't want to be Luke Skywalker or Han Solo? How do you get these characters? Well, the empire has to be corrupt. Making it morally OK to be doing illegal things. So... even though the three books don't say anything about it specifically, eventually most empires end up in some sort of political turmoil. Whether it be ones created by players, or the published materials. In fact, the first major revision of the rules, Mega-Traveller, took the canon setting and had it collapse under rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, fine, but what if the characters come into a starship through legitimate means, like chargen, or a generous GM who gives them missions that pay enough to purchase one (how financial institutions find these rag-tag groups worthy of financing a starship, I'll never know, but...)? Well, in this case, the commerce rules for starships kick in. And, interestingly, this can become a whole game in and of itself. Basically the game goes like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. On the current world, roll for cargoes you can purchase or transfer including passengers.<br/>\n2. Transit to some new world - calculate expenses (deal with any "random encounters" that occur).<br/>\n3. Sell off cargoes for whatever you can get, hoping to get a higher price than purchase because of the scarcity of the product on this world.<br/>\n4. Go back to 1 and repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, you can go on like this forever, never doing any "roleplaying" at all, and alienate all of the players who's characters aren't involved in the decision-making process of where to go next. If you're a numbers-obsessed 12 year-old, you can play for several sessions this way before realizing just how incredibly pointless it is. OK, there are stages to the game... you pay off the current starship, yay! Then later you sell it off, and use the proceeds (somehow without depreciation) and what you've saved to purchase a larger freighter - perhaps a custom model you've designed from the rules with lots of armaments to fend of pirates. And we're back to something like a legitimate version of the pirates game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, but wait... what if the ship you muster out with is not the Free Trader but the S type Scout? Well, then we get a slightly different variant. The cargo and passenger space is not enough to run at major profit... but then you don't have payments to make on a Scout ship (you can even fuel up for free at Scout bases). So this small income can pay for expenses and such. So... what do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you go on what was later termed (in DGPs periodical), the "Grand Tour." Basically characters go from planet to planet, seeing what's there in the universe, and... wait for it... commit crimes. Oh, I mean "have adventures."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother bias, of course, is D&amp;D.; Where killing monsters and taking their stuff is what play is all about. In other words, with a Story-Games bias, I can see a whole lot of other sorts of play emerging. But the issue is that you have three books of rules there that won't support any sort of Story-Game play not one lick. The rules are about making characters suitable for violence, playing battles, killing people for whatever reason, taking their stuff and selling it for profit, and generally powering up by purchasing ever more expensive weaponry including incredibly expensive starships.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yeah, and occasionally killing a wandering monster... I mean random wildlife encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Power Kill was written more for Traveller than for D&amp;D.; The amount of sociopathy exhibited by Traveller characters is monumental. I once thought it would be dramatic to have somebody run into a room all Raymond Chandler-esque saying, "I have 4 Million Credits worth of bearer's bonds in this briefcase, and somebody's after me. I'll give you a cut if you can hide me." One player beat the rest of them to it... "I pull out my snub pistol and shoot him in the head." Major Cray has long been remembered for that act...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn decades of play of Traveller, I never once got anything like Space Opera, nor any form of sci-fi that I've ever read. Book Zero (published after the first three in that second boxed edition), tries to give you an idea of what sort of games you can play with Traveller. But even then, what you get is "Life in the Imperium." Which, even after the rebellion, is just dull, dull, dull. No matter how you railroad the PCs through the adventure material, and try to make it like Star Trek on a Merchant Ship, it never has any drama to it. Eventually the game dies from player boredom. Most recently using GURPS Traveller, which I would contend is the best set of rules for Traveller to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's saying something. No? Can you make something cool out of those three books? Well... sure. In the same way you can make a Sports Car out of a Volkswagon by throwing away everything but the chassis, and replacing it's guts with a great engine. Which is to say that I don't think there's a lot there to work with for the sort of game that I think most of us here enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... I'm nostalgic about the game as well. If you can make it work for you... then great. Let us know. Give it a shot. Who knows, maybe the above is just the impressions of somebody who never "got" something about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's just not for a lack of trying, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71614/#Comment_71614" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T06:40:55+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  6:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>I personally found the ex-military bias of the game to be a fundamental aspect of the flavor, way back when.</blockquote>\nYes, I agree with you. However, the inclusion of "civilian" lifepaths meant that you could set groups in motion from different angles against the same kind of background. I've had ideas about police adventures, archaeology adventures, and consulting detective adventures (the last suited to a group with one or two players) which I'd never actually got off the ground but which seemed completely doable given the rules and background.<br><br>As for comparing the background to "Imperial England", that's how I thought of it as well. My most recent adventures with Traveller were set in a sketched out universe that was very much "post Great War" that had a vibe that was heavily informed by British period mystery series that I was addicted to at the time (still am): Foyle's War, Campion, Alleyn, Poirot, Wimsey, etc.<br><br>I played the computer tech pretty much as read from Classic Traveller -- silicon? you don't have silicon, man! Why would you need silicon when you have <i>vaccuum tubes</i> and <i>wax cylinders</i>! Of course your computer takes up 12 square metres of ship space! That's to accomodate the service crawlspace that goes through the middle of it so you can change the tubes when one burns out! The first adventure had them taking painstakingly slow and careful steps trying to get a damaged ship's computer up and running so they could figure out what had happened to it: the process took about a half hour of game time, and was based on the few times I had seen a PDP-11 or DEC Vax get warmed up and operational.

Note that supplement 4 adds civilian life paths, about 8, IIRC? I used the heck out of that. I often shot for the hunter with the safari ship...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the tech issues are hilarious. Traveller has dealt with this in varying ways over the years. Mostly by saying that in the 52nd century that there have been long dark ages. And also intimating that there are some strong Luddite feelings in the populace. These latter stolen from Frank Herbert's butlerian jihad. They have "thinking machines" but there are strong biases against androids, human enhancement, and psionics that are supposed to be holding things back. Hard to swallow that after 1100 years of relative stability in the Third Emperium that this holds true, but then the whole Brittish Empire notion could be part of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a key conceit to Traveller, BTW, that's introduced even in those original books. A "Traveller" is somebody that, for whatever reason, has become a part of the slightly more cosmopolitan society that travels between worlds regularly. The Jet-setters, basically. The notion is that the great majority of the populaces of worlds are bound to them by the gulfs of space and the cost of starships that can defeat these distances. Most importantly, it takes a week at least to get to the next star-system... including any communications. Commo travels at the speed of transportation that can carry it. So effectively this puts the empire back to the state of things before the telegraph in terms of communication and control.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole "feudal" angle is supported by this, the idea being that for the empire to keep control that they have to have locally appointed representatives who rule in the name of the emperor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, the worlds in question are only a loose confederation in that their allegiance to the empire is only really about paying taxes to have the imperial fleet guard them (and their trade) against external foes. To whit, each planet has it's own government that's sovereign locally. And these can be whatever has evolved there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a potentially fascinating part of the universe (even if only implied for the most part in the first three books). That is you have this dual layer of authority wherever you go. The system government, and then the imperial regime working with it. So you might have a planet with a president that runs everything, but then have an imperial Marquis who runs things there as they deal with inter-system affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, the setting, even if not the laid out Third Imperium (with it's 11,000 enumerated worlds - I kid not), is potentially quite interesting. I've always longed for an effective way to play in it. I think I could do it now on technique only. A good system would help (Imperial Secret Service in the Dockyard?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just took me 25 years to figure out how.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Marron" title="John Marron"><img alt="John Marron" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Marron">John Marron</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71627/#Comment_71627" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T08:23:21+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  8:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played the heck out of black box traveler when it came out (I was in high school, so I'd say '78 or '79).

the first four books and the occasional JTAS issue to go by.  Example of play:  I remember putting down on a planet to refuel (Jorca-10, etched in my memory).  It was a nearly airless world and we had to wear vac suits on the surface.  One of the local guys got in our cargo hold somehow and saw that we were carrying, of all things, chocolate bars.  Turns out this was some huge breach of religious protocol and it escalated to the shooting.  We had ACR's but they had an unlimited supply of religious nut-jobs.  So it was Roarke's drift with cases of chocolate bars as barricades, as we secured the fuel pump and filled our old ship up, dodging bullets and dropping fanatics.  Touch-and-go.  We gamed that one out using Airfix minis on a ping pong table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71701/#Comment_71701" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T13:06:07+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  1:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/viktor_haag/traveller/manySuns/index.html" rel="nofollow">a game where the PCs were all crewmembers on a picket patrol ship</a>. (The link is to a old, "stowed away" section of pages on my website, so the inter-page links might be a bit tricky; also, the pages only detail the prep and first three sessions.)<br/><br/>I used the LBBs as a resource to create the bits and pieces of the campaign background: the star systems the PCs played in, the patrol ship. I used the character creation process from High Guard to ensure that we had some PC variety but that all players ended up being naval characters. I had some high-ranking officers on the patrol ship that were NPCs, but all the other positions were open to be taken by PCs; once we had the PCs described, I went back and filled out some more of the ship's officers as NPCs.<br/><br/>The basic set up was "you are affiliated with 'The Royal Space Navy'; the Great War is over, but trouble is on the horizon; our Navy is going to assist in garrisoning the space of a small, but weak, ally between us and The Hun; you are crew members of one of those garrison patrol ships."<br/><br/>The specific kick off for the campaign was the "Mayday! Free Trader Beowulf!" setup -- a ship mysteriously in distress that the PCs must go out an investigate. This investigate lead to an enemy agent smuggling a devious weapon into the system and started to work out the ramifications thereof.<br/><br/>In some senses, I did not play "Traveller". I used Traveller as an engine to create background details, and I actually played a 20s Army/Spy Thriller type game. Ergo, the typical Traveller activities showed no appearance (inter-planet commerce, merchanting, scouting, and so on). There were no real areas unexplored in the PC's area. There was no opportunity for free-booting commerce. The PCs were playing the shiny-boot Imperials, not the free-booters.<br/><br/>I used a modified task system taken from the BITs group (amounted to roll 8+ on tasks to succeed, using skill level, difficulty, attributes etc as DRMs) instead of using the non-homogenous skill resolution from the basic game. I used the LBBs basic combat system with some bits from Mayday to fill in details (I don't remember precisely which). I did not use the canonical starship combat system: I hand-waved around that by bringing the action down to the PC level (i.e. you need to get to the gunnery turret; the ship is rocked by an explosion; the turret hatch is jammed, etc, etc.)<br/><br/>The playing lasted for a few months, and then we moved on to other things (mostly because my Real Life(tm) got in the way, so we switched focus to another player's stuff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71702/#Comment_71702" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T13:07:24+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  1:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 1:08PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Fred and Jason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's really interesting, because it supports the conclusion my confused brain came to years ago --<br/>\n<br/>\nThe color and character generation system was really cool -- but the rules were about a battle-mat game that had personalized figurines for each character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that in a bad way.

We discarded Traveller. I probably didn't play it again for several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward a few years. I decide I want to run an SF campaign. I meticulously write SF rules for RuneQuest (having not yet seen Other Suns and prior to the Ring World game). I ran one session under these rules before realizing they were way too cumbersome. Campaign was put in park.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt must have been the next weekend after this session that I became aware of the Traveller campaigns being run by Glen Blacow and Paul Gazis. They had their own starship creation system, but most importantly, Paul Gazis had come up with a simple and functional experience system. No longer was your 1 term rifle-1 admin-1 character forever limited. They also had cool campaigns. Another thing I took from their campaigns was the notion of rag tag, old beat up ships that things went wrong with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I restarted the campaign with Traveller rules with the Gazis experience system. And more importanly, recruited a single player who managed to click with my thoughts on campaign. The rest of the players in this campaign were more or less guest players, though a couple played frequently enough to impart direction to the campaign. They also clicked with us (while I am not 100% certain the creative agenda of this campaign was sim, I consider this one of the few campaigns that I can say had a solid creative agenda). Over time, the rules morphed in many ways (ultimately going to a simplified skill system, though retaining the Gazis experience system).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the details of the campaign:<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, the campaign was about exploration and tourism, supported by selling cargo. One thing I added that helped support exploration/tourism was that there were established "safe" jump routes, and non-established routes. If a ship travelled a new rout, the nav tapes could be sold and converted to nav tapes to be sold to other ships, turning that route into a "safe" route. The setting was a fallen empire, the players starting out in a small confederation of seven worlds. Nearby was all sorts of exciting stuff to investigate. One of the most interesting planets was the one visited in that first RQ in Space session, it was a former prison colony that had revolted and become a smuggling base. One of the most memorable events of the campaign happened there. Down in the underground cell area was an arena where combatants would enter and fight it out (sort of like lazer tag [amazingly like it, except I had not yet experienced lazer tag], except the guns are real). Many of the fighters were well known. A few PCs entered a fight that was advertised to include an NPC in battledress and MPFG (man portable fusion gun). One PC was reduced to a pile of ash. Boy was the player upset. Glen Blacow (who played in a few sessions including that one) commented that the player walked into it willingly. I offered something equivalent to "The T-Rex opens his mouth, do you want to crawl in?" Overall, the PCs were largely law abiding, though they did have run ins with the occaisional corrupt or unreasonable government. They explored ancient (technological) ruins, a sargasso sea of dead starships, met alien races, had a misadventure of trying to jump to a planet that was travelling at light speed, and many more. I would say that Larry Niven's writings were the biggest inspiration for this campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't remember if we ever totally abandoned the Traveller combat system with your three physical stats being your hit points. I did have my own starship construction system and combat system. Starship travel was always rather random, because unless you had a Navigator-5 or 6 (I capped skills at level 6), there was a significant whiff factor. Even then, there was still a significant whiff factor. A 2 on 2d6 always failed any skill roll, and a failed navigation roll was bad. I think there were penalties for longer jumps, or at least multiple rolls. Failed Pilot rolls weren't so bad, though they could leave you stranded without fuel. My jump system was much friendlier than Travellers, it wasn't all or nothing (per original three books, a ship capable of doing a Jump-6 [which basically requires almost all of the ship to be fuel and engine] is capable of travelling up to 6 hexes in a jump, but always uses the full amount of fuel - Book 5 added fancier engines that could throttle back), and instead of a hex map, I used a non-gridded map (though still 2-dimensional). As I recall, I also set it up so the faster jumps used fuel faster. So a Jump-1 ship could still go the same distance as a Jump-6, but it took longer, and less fuel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did run one other group (at college) in the campaign, but that lasted only a few sessions. I've tried one or two SF campaigns since them that failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71927/#Comment_71927" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T17:00:28+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  5:00PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was doing a little googling and found a funny <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=328143&amp;page=7&amp;highlight=motivation" rel="nofollow">thread</a> about the deadly character generation.<br><br>A<i> lot of Scouts don't seem to graduate Flight School.<br><br>They must have a <b>huge</b> memorial to the dead somewhere.</br></br></i> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71970/#Comment_71970" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T07:22:36+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  7:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dr. Rotwang talks about black box Traveller in the <a href="http://xbowvsbuddha.blogspot.com/2007/05/podcast.html" rel="nofollow">putative first episode of his new podcast</a> I Waste the Buddha With my Podcast.<br><br>He kind of makes it sound like an interplanetary sci-fi predecessor of the first version of In a Wicked Age.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72256/#Comment_72256" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T20:16:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  8:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We pretty much stuck to the printed adventures.

I started into Traveller with the holy troika of books, but I also had a copy of the double adventure that included Annic Nova (I don't ever remember what the other half was).  From then on, for me, Traveller was always about stumbling into the unknown.  The hulk of dead alien starship, decaying alien temples in the trackless jungle, the final machines of the long vanished ancients (after I got my hands on the library data books).  Sure, we did merchant stuff, pirate stuff, (never were that into the merc stuff), but it always got seriously strange at some point.<br>\n<br>\nOn the starship issue, it was pretty obvious to us that the players were going to have a ship.  If you got one mustering out, all well and good, otherwise it was always "oh, and here's your ship, you have it because blah blah blah".  I mean, there was so little guidance in the books to begin with, there was never anything that said you COULDN'T just have a ship.  Heck, I can recall a few campaigns that got started with "I just designed this cool starship, lets roll up some characters and drive it somewhere."<br>\n<br>\nCase in point, I ran a one-on-one campaign for my then girlfriend.  I designed a cool single man police cruiser.  She rolled up a character.  "Okay, you are special troubleshooter and liaison for the Imperium in the Vegan Autonomous District.

Fusion Gun, Man Portable. Not available in books 1-3. Most powerful weapon in books 1-3 is the laser rifle. Well, not counting the "Thrasher" weapon that animals can have.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that most of the conventions in these books were not built around making an interesting world so much as making up excuses for why things work the way they do to make them playable. Why does a Jump drive use up all it's fuel no matter how far it's jumping? Because it's easier to do the economics that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Wilhelm brings up that hoary but true principle that for anyone who has access to the modules published for a game, that these can have a huge effect on how you tend to play the game. If you played them, the modules for D&amp;D;, CoC, and Traveller tended to direct play quite strongly (or at least that's what I've seen). And, in fact, the very first module can tend to have a disproportionate effect, seeming to burn into players' minds what the game is supposed to be all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of Double Adventure 1: Shadows/Annic Nova as our first adventure, we started out with, what else, Adventure 1: The Kinunir. In which the group finds a lost colonial cruiser, and has to deal with it's eccentricities. This establishes the idea that salvaging ships is a great way to get rich fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that many of the adventures tended to have grid maps... dungeons in space! Shadows/Annic Nova are perfect examples of this. Even in adventures where the layouts are really irrelevant such as in Adventure 13: Murder on Arcturus Station (in which the players have to piece together a murder mystery), they still include these layouts. Why have them at all in this case? Well it's not to play the navigation game:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Referee": The corridor splits left or right here. Which way do you go?<br/>\nPlayer: Uh, which way leads to the Baron's room?<br/>\nRef: You didn't ask...<br/>\nPlayer: Let's play Stratego.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the only reasonable use of the maps is in case, you know, somebody decides to shoot somebody. Because what's a RPG adventure if there isn't at least a little killin'?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... what I'm saying is that people like Jason who can, apparently, give an idea of what adventures the LBBs 0-3 can deliver on their own are probably somewhat rare. The rest of us are tainted by the published adventures that we did play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand wanting to get the "pure" idea of what the books provide for play. But I recommend the adventures. If only as historical pieces that show the slow evolution from wargaming gamism to sim play.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of that, the problem is that all groups like Jason's are, as Ron puts it, Cargo Cults (a reference to a phenomenon from WWII where natives would develop strange understandings of supplies that they discovered air-dropped into their lands). That is, you're likely to get rather varying play from each group as they try to figure out exactly what it is that they're supposed to do with the rules presented. Again, Book 0 addresses some of this, but early editions didn't have that in their little black box (it's only in the "Deluxe Traveller" edition that you have), so many people (myself included) didn't have even that info to go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get back on track with what the LBBs support, one thing that they don't support is the idea that the characters have any history before their military career. Oh, in books 4 and 5 we at least get some details about schools they may have attended prior to getting into the military. But nowhere ever in any of the original Traveller material (and, I'll bet even in Mega-Traveller), is there ever any mention that the characters might have, say, a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you say, "But Mike, of course they have families, they didn't spring full-formed as clones did they?" I dunno, maybe they are all clones. The books don't say. Rather you have to keep in perspective that at the time we were playing in RPG infancy that most people just didn't even think about these things. The character wasn't a full character in a literary sense, he was just a tool that existed in-game that could do things like kill stuff, and gain in-game rewards such as money as an indicator of how well the player was employing his pawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, not everybody played this way, I'm sure. But it's the only way I ever played that edition of Traveller. Heck, even much later editions up to and including the GURPs game I ran tended to be this way. I often comment jokingly that 74% of all RPG characters are orphans. But that's really just to point out that most people don't even think about whether or not their character has a family. If asked, in order to avoid entanglements that might tie down their character, players tend to answer that their character is an orphan. "Hmm, if I have a family, can I get money from them? No? OK, then I don't have a family."<br/>\n<br/>\n(To some extent this comes down to source materials supporting this - Aragorn is the son of Arathorn who is dead, and who we know next to nothing about. Other family? Well there's Elrond...)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's face it, it's a wargame, as presented. If you don't agree, check out adventure 8, which gives you specs on the "Broadsword Class Mercenary Cruiser" and "adventures" for a group that might man one. Make that "scenarios" for the crew to fight. Trillion Credit Squadron is, in fact, a mini-wargame in and of itself. No role-playing required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have a basic choice. You can either try to discern what these books are theoretically supposed to provide, which is pretty ambiguous and has, I'd argue, more support for wargame than anything else. Or you can adhere to what one of our Cargo Cults has determined is the right thing to do in play (usually tainted by more of the books). Or you can figure out what it means to you as your own cargo cult.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the books. You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll find that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m right, that they really don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t say much at all about what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to do with the rules.
