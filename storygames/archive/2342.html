                    So here's a little idea (that popped into my head while skimming RPGnet and seeing a post about how much damage a nuke could do in D20 Modern).<br/><br/>Imagine a system that has some kind of scaling for opposition (like, from mook up to big bad boss), and then there's a whole 'nother catgeory - the Plot Device.<br/><br/>Now, say part of the game (GM prep, or collaboratively decided, or bid on, or whatever) is defined what counts as Plot Device, and what counts as a standard challenge. I think that Plot Devices may have their own set of mechanics which shade more towards the Hero Points/Fan Mail side of things (meta-currency and narrational authority things), but can't be affected by character ability use.<br/><br/>So, maybe in one style of game, a nuke isn't a weapon, it's a Plot Device. Like, you can't punch a nuke and make it go away. But, say in another style of game, your girlfriend breaking up with you is a Plot Device. No matter what, you can't convince her to stay.<br/><br/>Now, think of these two permutations - first, that Plot Devices are created on the fly (a la Mortal Coil's rules about magic); second, that each character can have a different relationship to each challenging thing - so, to most of the characters, the nuke is a Plot Device, but to the superhero dude, it's just a Major Challenge. Or whatever.<br/><br/>I dunno if I'm going to do anything with this, but it's a neat thought, if I do say so myself.                </div>

                            It absolutely seems reasonable, I will add in something else for character-centric games. That is, you can only change a plot device back into a normal challenge by making some change to your character.<br/><br/>In other words, you can make your girlfriend stay but you have to change from nice guy to controlling SOB (or vice versa).<br/><br/>You can stop the nuke but the radiation changes your superpowers.<br/><br/>Or what have you.                        </div>

                            We do a big section in this in SOTC that all was an outcropping of how the hell you handle falling damage.  I mean, seriously, in pulps, does anybody actually fall, hit the ground and then maybe die? Hell no.  Outside of inconvenient falls (like, through the floor down to the floor below) falls need to be handled completely differently, specifically, they cannot be the focus of a challenge, they shoudl only be a complication.  That is to say, you shoudl never be rolling to see if you fall into the pit of the sarlac, you shoudl be rolling for other things, with the presence of the sarlac adding complications to your roll.  That same model ended up applying to any insta-kill sort of scenario.  There's artillery bombarding the battlefield?  That complicates your fight, it doesn't intoroduce a chance that a player gets hit by a shell.  That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Which is to say, I think it's a powerful, useful distinction, so right on.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I would be very interested to see this developed, Nathan.  It holds the potential to introduce fundamental facts of a situation that can't be addressed and <em>the players understand and accept</em> that they can't be addressed, only worked around as part of the scenery.  It's getting to the point where players can accept that they can't really address the Big McGuffin X, no matter how clever they are.  Which is where the conversion options (as JD suggests) might be necessary -- or a distraction.  Can't tell.<br/><br/>So get designing already! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Take a look at Afraid (V.Baker).<br/>
<br/>
Afraid has four plot devices that the players choose as their characters take fallout. Maybe you could use something like that. In Descent (early early playtest) I had something I called Kill Tally. Which basically was that as the spacemarines blew away aliens (thereof the name) you'd count them, and when a number was reached the game reached a point of no return. At this stage the aliens either grew in power, or something bad happened in the colony that made survival more difficult for the marines.<br/>
<br/>
It was about the only thing that really worked in the game. But it could be usable, say when ever a player charges a thematic battery (Full Light Full Steam) the Plot Device counter rises with the same amount. Or maybe it only rises when you discharge the battery.<br/>
