My question is: what games? <br/><br/>So, the system works as follows.<br/><br/>Each character sheet has a slot corresponding to a <i>d4, d6, d8, d10, d12. </i><br/><br/><i><b>(a)</b></i> A player handbook details races, classes, backgrounds (hullo, <i>5e</i>!). <br/><i><b>(b)</b></i> Players pick an option for each of the three categories [Elf rogue of noble lineage, for example]. <br/><i><b>(c)</b></i> Each race, class and background has a list of flavourful "attributes" representing specific abilities, equipment, knowledge or connections.<br/><i><b>(d)</b></i> Players select attributes to be represented in their dice slots on their character sheets.<br/>[Our rogue has "Stealthy" as her d12 die, "Mistress of Elven Blades" as her d10, "Scion of Ancient House" as her d8, etc.]<br/><br/><i>finally..</i><br/><br/><i><b>(e)</b></i> When determining the outcome of their actions, players roll <i>1d20</i> in addition to whichever attribute dice is appropriate. If the total reaches or exceeds 20 they have succeeded. <br/><br/><i>Add subsystems to taste.</i><br/><br/>I believe similar is used in a more freeform way in <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/dungeon-squad" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Squad</a>.

It's an elegant idea, and intuitive, although I can't off-hand name a game that does exactly the same thing. D&amp;D has default attribute arrays, but the attributes themselves are fixed and universal, for instance. <i>Heroquest</i> perhaps comes closest, as it's got the default values for keywords and abilities, plus there sort of is a list of abilities you can pair with those numbers, more or less. It's definitely not showcased the way you do it, though.<br/><br/>The dice ladder thing is old hat, on the other hand; I think it became popular with '90s games like Earthdawn and such. Your specific dice mechanic with d20+[ability die] vs. target number is pretty novel, but it also has its foibles as others have mentioned, and it's not integral either - by which I mean that you could arbitrarily use the ability dice in some other way, too, if you wanted to. How well it serves depends on the totality of the design, maybe this is exactly the dicing mechanic that most beautifully captures the scope of the game.<br/><br/>As others have noted, it's impossible to make a value judgement on the mechanics without the rest of the game. I can see the game for which the system as outlined is already perfect, for instance, but then I can see how you could take it to many different directions, too, depending on what you were trying to accomplish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455174/#Comment_455174" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-19T22:00:51+00:00" title="July 19, 2016 10:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2016 7:58PM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anima Prime: pick 3 skills, make them up if you want, assign them to dice pool effectivenesses 2d, 3d, and 4d.<br/><br/>Fate: pick 10 skills, maybe from a universal list or maybe made up for the campaign/setting, assign them to bonus effectivenesses +1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 4.

One or more of the alternate ability score determination methods in AD&amp;D also use fixed scores.<br/><br/>The difference between a die size and a numeric stat value is merely cosmetic; it is fair to say that the attributes of the example rogue are "Stealthy" 12, "Mistress of Elven Blades" 10, "Scion of Ancient House" 8. <br/><br/>What's more special is constraining stats to feasible die sizes rather than merely to a range, allowing the fairly unusual mechanic of throwing a single die of that size, instead of using the stat value as a threshold, dice pool size, etc.<br/><br/>From this point of view, adding a d20 to the "dStat" reduces the novelty, since the resolution mechanic can be seen as a commonplace d20+skill linear scale roll, with extended variance but an obvious average bonus of (stat value+1)/2. <br/><br/>The only interesting and novel design dimension that comes to mind is probability distribution engineering. For example, with the same average (and presumably the same cost), there might be a nice mechanical difference between a fearsome but unimaginative robot with Sword +30 (fixed), a skilled duelist who knows two extreme styles and can switch between Sword +20d2 (safe and boring) and +2d24+5 (dangerous but often rewarding), an average veteran with Sword +8d6+2 and a reckless madman with Sword +2d30-1.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455182/#Comment_455182" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-21T16:51:07+00:00" title="July 21, 2016  4:51PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this does give you a "trapezoidal" distribution shape instead of the "plateau" distribution shape you get with d20+skill, but that doesn't matter if you're comparing against a constant TN.

Can your rogue ever become more stealthy? Or less stealthy?<br/><br/>\u2022 If the "DC" is always 20, then all tasks for which a roll is needed have the same chances of success. This generally isn't a problem in AW or OSR, so it depends on what kind of game you intend to run.<br/><br/>"What would improve it?" is hard to say without more information about what kind of game and gameplay you're going for.<br/></blockquote>\nGood questions!<br/><br/>\u2022 would like the attributes to be specific and for there to be a lot of flavourful options. I feel it would allow characters to be more unique. So "Soldier" might be broken down into "I led men in the last great war," "I survived the horror of the trenches," and "My reputation in hand-to-hand combat is well deserved" - these all have the broad uses that "soldier" might but tilt in more Wisdom/Charisma, Constitution/Int, and Strength/Charisma respectively. <br/><br/>\u2022Yeah, an XP subsystem can get thrown in there! What do you want? AW style XP-on-a-critical-miss? Points move dice up a size? And/Or give you a new d4 option? <br/><br/>\u2022 "This generally isn't a problem in AW or OSR." Yep. <br/><br/>\u2022 I'll get back to you on that one.<br/><br/>Right, it grows late and I am a slow typist. More tomorrow, but thanks! - you guys are great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455189/#Comment_455189" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-21T22:15:11+00:00" title="July 21, 2016 10:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> If I were going to tailor some fiction to this system, I'd aim my scenarios at unknowns and crapshoots with the d20 representing pure luck, and then I'd narrate the attribute roll as degree of competence in performing the action.</blockquote>You read my intentions for this system perfectly - neatly encapsulating the spirit of the thing.</blockquote>\nOK, if the dice are fictionally semantic then they're not necessarily superfluous.

You put your knowledge into action and leveraged it to do something related to that field of knowledge. This always takes a 4+.<br/><br/>Let's call it the Expertise die.<br/><br/>Success on the d20 (the Fate die) is all about circumstances, luck, and the whims of the gods. Here, you must roll a number determined by difficulty or whatever other rubric (perhaps influenced by prior rolls).<br/><br/>Could be as simple as 5+ for when you have the upper hand or are prepared for this action, 10+ by default, and 15+ when things are not in your favour. Or whatever you want your game to encourage: 5+ for when you have the help of a friend, 10+ when you're on your own, and 15+ when you're outnumbered or a friend betrays you.<br/><br/>You only really screw up when both fail, which makes your skill really meaningful.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the Expertise die gives you some kind of bonus or effect based on what you're doing. For instance, if you're using magic it means you applied the correct effect, contacted the right spirits, and maintained control over the magic. In combat, perhaps a Soldier skill allows you to maneuver to your advantage or protect an ally.<br/><br/>The Fate die creates a fortunate outcome, in the style of a "no, but". You didn't get what you wanted, but there is a silver lining, a positive outcome which you could use to your advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455539/#Comment_455539" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-08T19:17:18+00:00" title="August  8, 2016  7:17PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again to everyone whose posted, even if I didn't respond to you. So sorry for not returning to this thread, I was thinking long and hard. <br/><br/>Having given your comments some of the aforementioned thought and I've come back with the beginnings of something (he presumes). <br/><br/>My design parameters are:<br/><i>That dice are important, physically as well as conceptually, and we should showcase the tactility of the table-top. Even if die are being thrown in pools, we should treat each mysterious polyhedral with respect and consider how we read each result. </i><br/><br/>Ok, that was a lot of waffle but here's the general idea going forward:<br/><br/>(a.) Each check thrown contains at least 2 dice. <br/>(b.) A d20 is always thrown and this represents the character's fate or fortune. <br/>(c.) A lesser polyhedral (d4-d12) is also thrown, representing the character's abilities, preparedness or tools. There will be flavourful lists to choose from. This dice is considered a success if it reads <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4 or more. </span><br/><br/>(c.2) Depending on the nature of the second die, there may be a third that gives a value for the utility, strength or magnitude of the roll. This may be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constant</span>, such as a sword always doing d6 damage or used <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discretionally</span> to add granularity to the second die result, such as how many children come from a player's successful attempt to seduce a barmaid. <br/><br/>(d.) the objective is to roll 20 or higher with the combined score of the two primary die. <br/><br/>(d.2) If you rolled 3 or less on the second die, you fail the check. But, depending on the reading of the d20 it could be a "no, but" or "no, and" situation. <br/>Similarly, if it's agreed that your d20 roll is too low despite getting 4+ on the second die it may be a "yes, but" or "yes, if" situation. <br/><br/>(d.3) Critical hits do... appropriate things. Critical misses are held as "a bad thing in store" for that player in the next scene, such as being surprised in combat. <br/><br/>(d.4) Other players can aid the check-making player by opting to "help" by rolling a d20 of their own. The player can choose their own result or the aiding player's, but both d20s must be rolled together. A result of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4 or less</span> on the aiding d20 fails and the player character's help was actually a hinderance. The aiding player must choose either to have bad things happen to their character now, or bad things happen to the check-making character in the next scene. <br/><br/>...<br/>Ok, going to stop there because it'll be a rulebook otherwise. But does anyone see merit in the above?<br/><br/>I like the "help" rules a lot (to toot my own trumpet) and would want to bring more of that type of player choice into my design. <br/><br/>Anyway, easy to use and keeps a little arithmetic in the mix (like all <del>good</del> d20 systems).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455540/#Comment_455540" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-08T19:26:54+00:00" title="August  8, 2016  7:26PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since it sounds quite similar to my suggestion above (and the helping rules are almost exactly the same as in my game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">The Bureau</a>), I'm going to say I like it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>However, I'm not fond of the "hold back a failure to cause trouble later" rule.

And perhaps, if I like the helping rules so much, the game can be made to be more dependent on team-work.

Let's say I'm rolling a d10 (presumably a very good die to have!). My odds of various outcomes are... well, I'm not sure how they work together.<br/><br/>The d10 either says: <br/><br/>* (3/10 chance) You didn't do well. You failed the check.<br/>* (7/10 chance) You did well. "The die is considered a success."<br/><br/>The d20... has to be added to that to determine something. Let's say the d10 is a 7:<br/><br/>1-12: It's a "yes, but" result.<br/>13+: It's a full success.<br/><br/>More generically:<br/><br/>Our combined chances of a "yes, but" are 0.7*0.6=42%.<br/><br/>Our combined chances of a "yes" are 0.7*0.4=28%.<br/><br/>Let's say we rolled a 2, instead. Now the d20 says:<br/><br/>1-17: Failure.<br/>18-20: "No, but."<br/><br/>More generically:<br/><br/>Our combined chances of a "Failure" are 0.3*0.85=25.5%.<br/><br/>Our combined chances of a "No, but" are 0.3*0.15=4.5%.<br/><br/>That's all pretty good, except I don't think you'd want "no, but" results to be so rare.<br/><br/>Combining the totals of the dice with the results rolled on each is a bit funny. Basically, the d10 roll is determining the "difficulty" for the d20 roll, and it's not clear why this is a good thing. What do we get out of it?<br/><br/>Is there another level of meaning we can get out of the d20 roll, separately from the total? I think you'd like to, but I don't know what that meaning is. So, what did you have in mind?<br/><br/>(On a sidenote, I'd love to hear a mathematical explanation for why my hypothetical odds, above, add up to 100%!

If, for example, we design so that the PCs are more loosely defined and instead of having the tired "I'm Sneaky - d10" trait/dice system we opt for a contextual/discretional model where we know that a character is sneaky but is it worth a d10 in all situations?<br/> I like a model where players are negotiating for larger dice as we set up and lay down the stakes of a challenge. <br/><br/>So d4 would represent the bare minimum relevancy of a trail, where as d20 would be it's perfect, formal usage. <i>So the sharp-shooter maybe can get a d4 to assist in a forensics investigation of a crime scene (she knows how guns work, but not much about forensic science) but would use a d20 to see if she can get gold in an Olympic shooting competition (the trait is totally relevant and there are no conditions to effect her using it).</i> I could see a fun bargaining for better dice going on at table, with the GM potentially laying out conditions or raising the stakes for better terms. <br/><br/>I've realised that (a) I'm being very conversational with my descriptions and have no idea if I'm making sense at all, and (b) I've not even looked at the probabilities. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455577/#Comment_455577" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-12T15:25:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2016  3:25PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that might help in this case is using "roll under", so that die types scale more smoothly.<br/><br/>The problem I was pointing out above is that you can't have independent "success on each die" and "success based on the total", because they interact in weird ways (or, at least, you have to make sure it's doing what you want).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455579/#Comment_455579" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-12T16:11:00+00:00" title="August 12, 2016  4:11PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does a pass/fail on the assets die tell you?

For that to work well, I think you'd have to get closer to matching die sizes. It doesn't make a great deal of sense to roll a d4 for your Asset and a d20 for Luck, as it makes your skills almost irrelevant.

"Attributes" - which are general innate abilities, like being Strong, Stealthy or Magical.<br/>2. "Assets"  - being specific extrinsic implements, like Throwing Javelins, Thieves' Tools or Knowledge of Resurrection Rituals. <br/><br/>Attributes and Assets aren't quantified numerically. A character is Strong, he doesn't have "Strength 16." I want to invite the GM and Player to critically engage in how being Strong works for this character - is it the untested, showy brawn of a gymrat, the sinewy strength of real labour, or the hardened gristle of a professional warrior? We can move into a play-space that's all about those power-questions, mining the fiction and character positioning. <br/><br/>When players want their characters to achieve an immediate goal but have to overcome a challenge they should roll a check. Rolling a check involves gathering a small pool of dice, rolling and interpreting the results as a group (again, inviting criticality). <br/><br/>You get one die from an applicable Attribute. This is either a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 or d20, depending on how well the GM feels your Attribute applies to the situation, d4 being the least appropriate and d20 being a perfect marriage of ability and conditions (it's a rarity e.g d20 Dexterity might be awarded to do a well-practiced acrobatics routine in a kitted-out sports hall after a good rest and warm-up). <br/><br/>Similarly, you get another die from Assets if that's applicable to (Yes, your cloak helps you be more stealthy). Attributes and Assets values are both conditional, so an Asset could be "the heavy rain today" when you're rolling a check to loose the orcs tracking you through the forest. An Attribute could be "I have blonde hair" if that was somehow the most relevant asset to the check. It's all about the fictional positioning and further defining characters and the world in general play (rather than just in character creation). <br/><br/>[A third die could be added and I'd previously been considering making it some kind of fate or luck randomiser, but I think Story would be better served if this was something like an Instincts or Theme die. So say a player's character had the instinct "Kill all the Orcs!" then he'd get a third die for checks involving killing orcs. Or hitting up a character's "Love always prevails!" Theme then any check where she's invoking love's triumph she gets another die for her pool. I've not quite worked this out.]<br/><br/>The check is rolled. If the sum of the results is equal or greater than 10 then the challenged faced by the character to achieve an immediate goal has bean overcome. We left the orc trackers behind in the forest; the acrobatics display was completed and impressed the audience. <br/><br/>I think this system would lean heavily on "helping" rules and on opposing rolls - rolling verses the GM's dice-pool representing an NPC or even general threats (a severe ice storm (d10) with a d8 "the pass is dangerous in winter!" asset could be fun to roll against as a survival-based character).  <br/><br/>I could see a whole skirmish against the bad-guys being hinged on the fighter's goal to cast the villain into the fiery pit with rest of the party stacking on their help dice (and getting narration rights) on his main move. \n<blockquote><br/>The problem I was pointing out above is that you can't have independent "success on each die" and "success based on the total", because they interact in weird ways (or, at least, you have to make sure it's doing what you want).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>What does a pass/fail on the assets die tell you? Or is only the cumulative result relevant?</blockquote>\nThe total of the pool is to see whether the immediate challenge was overcome to achieve the immediate goal. The group also considers the results of each die individually to determine the lasting effects of the check going forward. <br/><br/>If an Attribute or Asset die's result is 4 or greater it is considered a "Positive," if it is lower than 4 it is a "Negative." <br/><br/>So having a d10 and a d6 for being a strong fighter wielding a sword attempting to injure an orc warrior and rolling a 8 and a 3 respectively would be interpreted as successfully hurting the orc with a "positive" attribute outcome and a "negative" asset outcome. <br/><br/>So perhaps, in fiction, we could interpret positive/negative results as the character obviously displaying their worth as an opponent, maybe intimidating the orc with their strength - a real threat - but also that the blow overextended the characters reach and we should roll to see if the orc can recover from his surprise and pain fast enough to take this small advantage. <br/><br/>You see, ongoing fiction and positioning and building the story even when we're kicking orcs in the face. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455736/#Comment_455736" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T00:39:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2016 12:39AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the difference between Attributes and Assets?<br/><br/>It sounds like they could easily and simply be merged.<br/><br/>Your system comes down to "judge the fictional positioning and assign a die size which sounds right".<br/><br/>The example of Attribute and Asset in your post (fighting an Orc) is really not clear to me.

Extraneous/Specific respectively. <br/><br/>So Conan has "Strength of Many Men" as an Attribute (it's innate to him and general in application) and "Sword of My People" as an Asset (it's extraneous and has specific uses).<br/><br/>Gandalf is "Wise and Learn'd" (Attribute) but also knows "The Roads and Paths of Middle Earth" (An Asset, as a specific sub-category of his being Wise and Learn'd). <br/><br/>Loosing an asset could, I imagine, be a common result of failure - whereas loosing an attribute would be much more grevious. <br/><br/>Yes, perhaps they could be merged - but I'm fairly certain there's a real difference in play between Who You Are and What You Have. Whether I'm hitting that distinction in the best and most fun way is the real question. <br/><br/>I'm entirely happy with a system whose core is about leaving fictional authority with the players, not the designer. The system can (and should) build on that supposition, to aid the players in framing and drawing out narrative, rather than trying to define what that narrative is at its inception. <br/><br/><br/>Ok, so: My fighter attacks the Orc! <br/>My fighter is Strong and has a Sword. The group and I have worked out from previous battles that I can roll a d10 for my Strength (my attribute) and a d6 for my Sword (an asset). <br/>I roll. I get a 8 and a 3 respectively (11 total).<br/>Great, I've beaten the DC of 10. My blow hits the orc. <br/>Now, the d10 score is over 4 so we consider it a "Positive," whereas the d6 is under 4 so it's "Negative." These + and - are used to colour my move and define my fighter's position going forward.<br/>So maybe I want to spend my + to announce that my strength is intimidating to the Orcs, but the DM may suggest that my - means I'm also overextended and vulnerable to the next Orc attack. <br/><br/>A little spend economy crops up here: whatever the roll I either have -/- which the DM can use to mess with me or push hard moves, +/- that can either cancel itself out or get mixed fictional results, or +/+ which I can use to my advantage or aid others.<br/><br/>Making more sense, or is it back to the drawing board time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
