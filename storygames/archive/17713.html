My goal is to play a decent number of games during this precious time off. I would love to play with some of you wonderful people, so if you have a game going on all ready let me know when and via what online service. I'm itching to play Apocalypse World (read it but haven't played yet), always up for Fiasco and Durance, would love to play The Quiet Year (only played once), and just up for all around anything.<br/><br/>Reply here or shoot a message to my inbox if you'd like. Hoping for some good play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
