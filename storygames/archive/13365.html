These Finalists are <a href="http://gamechef.wordpress.com/2010-playoff-rules/" rel="nofollow">listed here</a>, along with the guidelines for the playoffs, a current record of each game's "playoff score," and (where the designers have submitted them) links to supplemental material and ongoing discussions about their games.  Basically, whichever game sees the most play by the most distinct groups of people between Nov 5th and Dec 15th will win Game Chef.<br/><br/>Please consider logging your vote by playing one or two of the 24 Finalists by Dec 15th.  You get to help a game win just by playing something that catches your eye!<br/><br/>If you would like more information on the Finalists and other submitted games, my reviews of all of them are <a href="http://gamechef.wordpress.com/2010-submissions/" rel="nofollow">up here</a>:<br/><br/>Designers!  IF YOU ARE A FINALIST and have not yet submitted a new, shorter description of your game and links to updated rules or supplemental materials, PLEASE DO SO IMMEDIATELY so that the folks running through the list of Finalists have everything they need to choose between different games to play.<br/><br/>Thanks, and best of luck to everyone in the Playoffs!<br/>Master Chef Jonathan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301956/#Comment_301956" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T13:40:08+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  1:40PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan,<br/><br/>I posted a slightly updated description and a totally updated link to my game and materials, but haven't seen them show up yet.

Five of the Finalists seem to have opted not to participate in the Playoffs (haven't submitted descriptions, etc.), so that leaves 19 games of which 8 have been played, which is roughly half, with more than two weeks still remaining.
