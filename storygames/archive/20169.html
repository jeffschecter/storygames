Shane Ward asked me to review one of his modules (all PWYW). I chose The Overrun Mines, a Labyrinth-Lord-adventure for level 1 characters. It\u2019s a simple location-based module.<br/>I recently bought the 2nd edition of Whitehack (review of the 1st edition here), so I wanted to play the adventure with this ruleset.<br/>There are 4 pre-gens included in The Overrun Mines, so I converted them to WH and will now run them through the module in a solo experiment. I\u2019m playing the GM and will emulate the players with the Mythic GME. So most of the content comes from the adventure itself (I\u2019m railroading here but nobody will complain, right?) and the PC\u2019s reactions will be determined by Mythic.<br/><br/>Whitehack\u2019s 2nd edition moves away from its 0e/Swords-&amp;-Wizardry-roots in favor for more distinctive rules. The attack bonuses (BHB/BAB) and the armor class are different now. The Attack Value (AV) replaces BHB and starts at around 10-11 (BHB was 0-1). An unarmored human now has AC 0 with ascending armor class, so Cloth is AC 1 and Chainmail AC 4. These changes come with the advantage of a unified task system (roll under or equal) but the disadvantage of the need to convert things instead of using them directly from an S&amp;W ruleset.<br/><br/>About the adventure: The mines are located near a small town and were its income for years. Now the mine is plagued by horrors. The town\u2019s steward offers a reward for the brave adventurers that will take care of the problem.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s check the provided rumours tables first.<br/>Miners Rumours: There are traps in the mine, meant to keep bothersome freelancers out!<br/><br/>So, the four characters from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild (I made that up as an affiliation group for the PCs) enter the mine now.<br/><br/>Actual Play<br/><br/>Scene 1<br/><br/>Mine Entrance<br/><br/>This is the entrance to the mine, there is a large cave entrance, inside a small path leads down into the mine, it is very dark. The tunnel is braced with large boards.  A door from the mine entrance lies in splinters upon the ground.  <br/>(Please note: text like the above is more or less stolen from the adventure or made up by me.)<br/><br/>Two characters have torches which they lit.<br/><br/>What do the characters do? Do they approach cautiously? (CF 5, very likely) \u2013 Yes. (Mythic question)<br/><br/>Common Room<br/><br/>This room is 20` by 25`, it looks like it was used as a staging area to carry out the finished ore.  In the west corner are a few barrels, in the east corner, is a haphazard pile of iron ingots (10).  A passage leads to the southeast.  <br/>Do the characters inspect the barrels and the ingots? (CF 5, 50/50) \u2013 Yes.<br/><br/>They find 2 days worth of provisions and 2 pickaxes.<br/><br/>You come to a junction, there are passageways to the left, right and straight ahead.  <br/>Let\u2019s just randomly decide where the characters go, as there are no signs to differentiate the corridors. (I roll 1d4, where I would re-roll a 1). The group goes ahead.<br/><br/>Does the thief scout ahead? (CF 5, 50/50) \u2013 Extreme No.<br/><br/>The group stays together and blunders ahead with no regards for their safety and enter \u2026<br/><br/>The Iron Mine<br/><br/>This room is fairly large, 45\u201d by 35\u201d.  This is the main mine.  The miners have worked on the sections here, digging deeper into the ground.  There is a large 15\u201d hole in the centre of the room.  The walls of the mine have also been worked on.  In the centre of the hole is a large grey worm!  The worm appears to be hurt, it bleeds profusely from wounds.  Littered throughout the mine are dead miners.  There are sections of ore that can be converted to ingots in the room; they are in large wheel barrows.  <br/>Do the characters attack the worm immediately without checking the room first? (CF 5, somewhat likely) \u2013 No.<br/><br/>So, Haw-Thrig (the thief) and Galahad (the fighter) check out their surroundings while Wiz, the Wise Scholar (wizard) and Alhan, the Wise Cleric, stand back. (Wise is one of Whitehack\u2019s character classes, with Strong and Deft as the others.)<br/><br/>Haw-Thrig gets a positive double roll for his skill check because his vocation group is thief and searching for traps etc. fits. He succeeds without getting hurt by the Worm.<br/>Galahad doesn\u2019t find anything. Instead, while searching the room, he slips while evading the Grey Worm (he rolled a fumble). While nothing happens to him, his torches fall down the hole.<br/><br/>Haw-Thrig finds a key and 15 CP.<br/>Afterwards, the characters will want to finish off the creature. The characters get to act first (house rule).<br/><br/>Combat Round 1<br/><br/>Galahad uses the higher ground and jumps onto the injured Grey Worm. He has AV (Attack Value) 12 but gets combat advantage +2. That means his AV is 14. The Worm has an AC of 5, so Galahad needs to roll 6-14 (higher than the target\u2019s AC but equal or lower than his AV). Galahad rolls an 11, so that\u2019s a hit, he does 5 damage (his sword has 1d6+1 damage rating).<br/><br/>Haw-Thrig uses this distraction to try to disappear in the shadows so he can sneak up onto the Worm. Yep, success (DEX check).<br/><br/>Alhan also jumps into the fray but misses the worm.<br/><br/>The Scholar, Wiz, casts his miracle \u201cMagic Missile\u201d for an HP cost of 1 and does 3 damage. It hits automatically, no attack roll or save negates.<br/><br/>Next up is the Grey Worm. It has an AV of HD+10 (=15) but gets a penalty because it is injured (AV-1).<br/><br/>The worm trashes around and tries to crush you underneath his slimy belly. You are fast enough to evade its slightly clumsy attacks.  <br/>Combat Round 2<br/><br/>Haw-Thrig sneaks up from behind and tries to stab the creature. Success (thanks to combat advantage)! The dagger buries itself into the Worm\u2019s hide for 4 damage.<br/><br/>Galahad whirls his blade and cuts the Worm but to no avail.<br/><br/>Alhan goes next, but the Grey Worm just shrugs off his blows with the club.<br/><br/>Wiz moves towards the worm (close distance) and casts \u201cMagic Missile\u201d again, 1 damage. He loses 1 HP for the miracle.<br/><br/>The worm attacks Galahad (needs to roll between 4 (Galahad has AC 3) and 14 (the Worm\u2019s AV). With a roll of 4 that\u2019s a success, so he does d6+2 damage. That would mean 7 damage and put Galahad at Death\u2019s doorstep. So he tries to save against the damage with a Constitution roll. Success! That means he can reduce the damage by 1d6 (= 4). That leaves Galahad at 4 HP and standing.<br/><br/>Combat Round 3<br/><br/>The three characters in the fray can flank the Worm (combat advantage). Galahad does 3 damage.<br/><br/>Alhan rolls a 1 for his melee attack. Even with +2 for combat advantage it isn\u2019t enough to hurt the Worm (AC 3).<br/><br/>Haw-Thrig\u2019s trusty dagger hurts the vile creature again (3 damage).<br/><br/>Wiz casts \u201cMagic Missile\u201d again (cost 1 HP). 6 damage! Whohoo!<br/><br/>The Worm retaliates and attacks the thief. That would be 7 damage. Haw-Thrig tries to save with a CON check. Success! He mitigates 1d6 (=3) damage, so that leaves 4 damage.<br/><br/>Combat Round 4<br/><br/>The Worm is still not dead. Let\u2019s change that.<br/><br/>Alhan goes first. Thanks to the flanking bonus the creature can\u2019t evade his attacks. 5 damage!<br/><br/>Galahad takes a stab at the creature with his short sword and finishes off. With a wet sound he cleaves the Worm into two halves.<br/><br/>You find  11 GPs, 4 Gems (worth 100 GPs, 75, 10, 750), 2 well-made Crossbow Bolts (+2). Galahad's torches were buried underneath the Worm and are unusable.  <br/>End of Scene 1, the Chaos Factor goes up by 1                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs" title="sbrplaysrpgs"><img alt="sbrplaysrpgs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/050/n24UD1GW770MM.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs">sbrplaysrpgs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445184/#Comment_445184" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T10:11:57+00:00" title="May 11, 2015 10:11AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 2<br/><br/>Alhan heals Galahad and Haw-Thrig with his miracle \u201cCure Light Wounds\u201d (cost 1 HP for each miracle). That brings Galahad back to full HP and Haw-Thrig to 4 HP. Galahad binds Haw-Thrigs wounds (trained task roll) for 1d6-3 HP (rolls 2, so no effect).<br/><br/>At the other end of the room is another corridor. After a short distance it branches off into two directions.  <br/>The characters choose the left corridor and come to a locked door which appears to be fairly new.<br/><br/>The thief listens at the door but everything is silent (WIS check). He silently picks the lock (DEX check) and they can enter the room.<br/><br/>The room is 20\u2019 by 10\u2019.  The remains of a recent fire scar the ground, blackened bones lie on the floor.  <br/>Haw-Thrig scouts ahead. The others wait at the door. Haw-Thrig needs to make a perception check (WIS) to see if he is surprised by the rising skeletons. Failure!<br/><br/>3 skeletons rise from the bones and attack the thief!  <br/>The Goblin Skeletons have AV 11 but with surprise they get combat advantage, so it\u2019s AV 13 this time. That would mean 3 and 5 damage as two of them hit.<br/>Haw-Thrig saves with a CON check to shrug off the damage and mitigates the 5 damage by 1 to 4. Still, the two attacks are enough to kill him. Ouch!<br/><br/>Characters go next, monsters last. Galahad charges with a battle cry and rips the first skeleton apart! (He needs to roll between 4 (skeletons have AC 3) and 14 (his AV of 12 + Charge bonus of 2. He rolls 4, so that\u2019s within the margin.)<br/><br/>Alahan joins the fray (margin 4-12 (AV of 10 + 2 for Charge), he rolls a 4). His club hammers the Goblin Skeleton down and shatters it.<br/><br/>The wizard attacks with his quarterstaff but is hindered by his friends (Wiz rolls an 18, far above his AV of 10).<br/><br/>The remaining skeleton is too slow to damage any of the characters and after a second round it is also reduced to shattered bones (it only had 1 HP).<br/><br/>There is nothing of value in the room. The skeletons are Goblin skeletons.<br/>End of Scene 2, CF goes up by 1 to CF 7<br/>Scene 3<br/><br/>Do the characters go on? (CF 7, 50/50) \u2013 Extreme No.<br/><br/>So, that means the three remaining adventurers double back. They take the corpse of their fallen thief and retreat.<br/><br/>Do they try to recruit another party member before continuing? (CF 7, very unlikely) \u2013 No.<br/><br/>Ok, that means they go back to the latest safe room they found to rest. That would mean the Common Room. The characters get some HP back and the adventure can continue.<br/><br/>End of Scene 3, CF goes down to CF 6<br/>Scene 4<br/><br/>The characters start again from the Common Room and come to the junction where they originally went straight ahead to the main miners area with the Grey Worm.<br/><br/>Do the adventurers choose to explore one of the other corridors they originally left behind (CF 6, likely) \u2013 Yes.<br/><br/>I\u2019m rolling to see which way they go: right.<br/><br/>The corridor branches off, the right passageway is slightly wider and more used.  <br/>Do they choose the left passageway? (CF 6, 50/50) \u2013 Yes.<br/><br/>In this tunnel there was a cave in and it is full of rubble.<br/>(1 in 6 chance for another cave in \u2013 nothing happens.)<br/><br/>Do the characters search the rubble? (CF 6, 50/50) \u2013 No.<br/><br/>There's nothing of interest here.   <br/>The adventurers now go back and choose the other way and find the<br/><br/>Miners Barracks<br/><br/>This room is 15\u2019 by 20\u2019.  The room has 6 small bunk beds, a large fireplace, food stuffs littered about, and a large table in the centre. 6 disgruntled looking miners live here.  <br/>(45% chance that the miners attack the PCs on sight \u2013 roll of 78, everything\u2019s ok.)<br/><br/>Upon seeing you, one of the miners sneers. "What a ragtag bunch. Bugger off!"  <br/>Ok, now let\u2019s try the Auction mechanic of Whitehack. The characters want to convince the miners to leave peacefully. The miners want to be left alone.<br/>This one is a bit difficult to emulate as I know all the stats. But we\u2019ll see. Every character bids for himself but the miners are one group, so the characters have a slight advantage.<br/><br/>Galahad: \u201cLook folks, it\u2019s dangerous here in the mines. We already lost a party member and there was a cave in in one of the tunnels. You better leave.\u201d (CHA 11 + \u201csecret\u201d roll of 4) The Wanderer bids 5.<br/><br/>Alhan: \u201cWe are only concerned with your safety. In the main main there was a big Grey Worm and many dead miners. You don\u2019t want to end like them, do you? I don\u2019t think the deities will approve of this foolishness.\u201d (CHA of 12 + \u201csecret\u201d roll of 3) The cleric bids 6.<br/><br/>The wizard chimes in with: \u201cWe know you are brave souls but you shouldn\u2019t waste your lives.\u201d (CHA of 4 + \u201csecret\u201d roll of 6) Wiz only goes for a one-bid as he doesn\u2019t want to go higher than Alhan\u2019s 6.<br/><br/>Miners: \u201cYou can talk all you want but this is our life. We need to make a living.\u201d (HD1+5=6 for CHA and a \u201csecret\u201d roll of 3) They go for a one-bid as well.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s dissolve the situation. Alhan bid highest so he has to make a skill check first: higher than 6 but lower or equal to 15. Alhan rolls a positive double roll for his CHA stat because he\u2019s a cleric. He rolls a 15 (crit!) and succeeds.<br/><br/>After some more talk the miners grudgingly agree to leave. They also give you a key to a barred tunnel entrance. They were attacked by a group of mosquito-like winged creatures. "Man, these things were creepy. And they killed some of our comrades. If you want to go down to the next area you'll need to pass this tunnel, sorry."<br/>End of Scene 4, CF goes down by 1 to CF 5                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs" title="sbrplaysrpgs"><img alt="sbrplaysrpgs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/050/n24UD1GW770MM.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs">sbrplaysrpgs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445185/#Comment_445185" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T10:12:05+00:00" title="May 11, 2015 10:12AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 5<br/><br/>Do the adventurers go back and explore the rest of level 1? (CF 5, very likely) \u2013 Extreme Yes.<br/><br/>Lead Head Quarters<br/><br/>So, Galahad the Wanderer, the Cleric Alhan and the Scholar Wiz decide to inspect one of the other tunnels and come to a locked door. Unfortunately, their rogue is already dead. The three still have his lockpicks, though. The Wanderer tries his luck.<br/><br/>(It\u2019s a trained roll so he gets a negative double roll which results in a 19.)<br/><br/>The lockpick breaks in this sturdy lock. No chance to open the door silently.  <br/>Frustrated, Galahad wants to bash it in. He tries to destroy the lock with the sword pommel. Success!<br/><br/>The room is 10\u2019 by 10\u2019. Inside the room is a small study, with a table, and a bookshelf.  On the table are a few volumes and a journal.  <br/>Wiz immediately goes to the books and deciphers them. There\u2019s an inventory of the mining operation and some notes about a locust of stirges and a purple worm.<br/><br/>Do the characters search the room for secret doors or traps? (CF 5, somewhat likely) \u2013 No.<br/><br/>The characters now go back to the room where they originally lost their comrade. The room leads to a tunnel which branches off into two directions. The first enter the left passageway and come to the<br/><br/>Sleeping Quarters<br/><br/>The door to this room is unlocked and hanging by two bolts. Nothing here.<br/><br/>They go next to the<br/><br/>Throne Room<br/><br/>Do they approach cautiously? (CF 5, likely) \u2013 Extreme Yes.<br/><br/>They try to sneak up the room. Wiz is the clumsiest characters so he will make a check (DEX 6). He rolls a 1, so that\u2019s a success.<br/><br/>This room is 20\u201d by 25\u201d.  It was previously the throne room of the goblin king who inhabited this section of the mines.  An undead goblin is strapped down to the throne. This room has also been firebombed, the ground is blackened and there are bones littered across the floor.  A fake wall to the southeast is partially open.  <br/>The goblin zombie hasn't detected you yet.  <br/>Do the characters choose to fight? (CF 5, 50/50) \u2013 Extreme Yes.<br/><br/>Combat Round 1<br/><br/>They stand back and Wiz will cast \u201cMagic Missile\u201d from a distance (-1 HP).<br/><br/>The undead shrieks, breaks free of his leather strapping and lurches towards his assailant. At the same time, 4 Goblin Skeletons rise from the bones on the floor.  <br/>The entrance to the room is a bottleneck so the characters take a defensive position and let them come. Two characters can stand besides each other.<br/><br/>Combat Round 2<br/><br/>Characters go first. The skeletons are faster to arrive than the Goblin king so Galahan attacks one of them (AC 3).<br/>(Galahan rolls 9, that\u2019s higher than the skeleton\u2019s AC but lower/equal to his AV of 12.)<br/><br/>He kills one skeleton and uses the momentum to attack another (a class trait, he is a Strong character). He only rolls a 2, that\u2019s not enough to meet the enemy\u2019s AC.<br/><br/>Now it\u2019s Alhan\u2019s turn. He pummels one of the skeletons with his club (roll of 4, success).<br/><br/>Wiz casts \u201cMagic Missile\u201d on the Goblin King (-1 HP) for 4 damage. The missile explodes the undead\u2019s head and brain matter splashes all around.<br/><br/>Now, the 2 last skeletons can attack. One of them strikes Galahan at a gap of his armor and makes 6 damage. It extracts his bloodied bony hand from Galahan\u2019s side with force.<br/>Alhan can evade the other skeleton\u2019s attack.<br/><br/>Combat Round 3<br/><br/>Galahan grabs the skeleton\u2019s arm, brings down his sword (rolls a 6) and crushes the undead. He uses the momentum to strike at the last undead but misses (roll of 13, that\u2019s over his AV). They now can flank the opponent.<br/><br/>Alhan uses the distraction and strikes the skeleton from behind (roll of 12, AV of 10 + combat advantage 2, crit!). He crushes the undead\u2019s bony frame.<br/><br/>Wiz searches the body of the zombie and the room. There\u2019s the exit to the not-so-secret room and the Goblin King also has a key on him.<br/><br/>End of Scene 5, CF goes up to CF 6<br/>Let\u2019s stop here. The adventure is a fairly generic dungeon crawl which is fun in itself but for the sake of trying it out I feel it\u2019s enough. I will post a review in the future. The Grey Worm was quite powerful, yet that could be due to my clumsy conversion. 1st level characters can be quite squishy.<br/><br/>At first, Whitehack\u2019s new system was unfamiliar and I needed to look up the rules. The first edition was very much Swords &amp; Wizardry WhiteBox with heavy houserules, different classes and an own magic system. But the basic mechanisms (task rolls/skill rolls, attack rolls, monster entries) were the same. The new system is different. I like it so far but there is a learning curve.<br/><br/>I was already a fan of the 1st version and I think the 2nd edition is even better but still maintains the good aspects of the 1st edition. Perhaps I\u2019ll write a detailed review in the future, we\u2019ll see.\n<p><em>Links:</em> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/134136/The-Overrun-Mines?affiliate_id=330920" rel="nofollow">The Overrun Mines</a> <em>(aff)</em> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/browse/pub/6654/3-Toadstools?affiliate_id=330920" rel="nofollow">3Toadstools Publishing @RPGnow</a> <em>(aff)</em> <br/><br/><a href="http://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Whitehack</a> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html" rel="nofollow">Mythic GME</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445251/#Comment_445251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-16T19:02:25+00:00" title="May 16, 2015  7:02PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At first, Whitehack\u2019s new system was unfamiliar and I needed to look up the rules.

I'd like to hear your thoughts on good or bad things that are different in second edition.<br/><br/>My problem is that I fell in love with first edition and still feel it's a complete and very good game. I'm attracted to minimalism in all sorts of areas (fiction, poetry, productivity systems, furniture, visual art, rules systems, and so on) and Whitehack first edition was more minimalistic than second edition. "Perfection is... when there is nothing left to take away", and all that.<br/><br/>Even though it was minimalistic, it didn't lack rules or setting information, and even though I've played around 30 sessions of first edition it feel like I haven't used a fraction of the material. Second edition expands on a lot of areas, and there are a lot of cool ideas there. I especially enjoy the new combat system and streamlined resolution systems for tasks, combat, and saves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
