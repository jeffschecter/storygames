Seeing someone's begining 4th edition campeign here someone joked/suggested relationship mapping the gods for extra story gamey goodness. Me being a bright boy and lazy, snagged this for my own to try some story goodness in my otherwise really traditional game (dnd 4e). So i asked my players (before the game started) which gods were sleeping with whom, and my lovely wife surprised me with this gem. (it helps that she's trained in the Classics [the time period]). This is kinda of what happens applying Greek Methology and Religion crossing it with DnD 4e content. <br/>\n<br/>\nOhhhh!  Melora and Vecna so had a tryst!! ... prob after a great fight over there respective domains (Melore - wilderness at sea, Vecna - undead).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this ended up with them having three kidz, but fearful they would be like there father Melore tried to rid them of there evil parts.  This led them to being aborted.  Hence some icky abberations and shadowy creatures!  Melore, not able to stand the sight of the children turned her back on them.  They now work at their fathers side creating death in their wake. <br/>\n<br/>\nNecromancy and Rituals often call upon one or all of them to assist in; killing as many bodies as possible, , calling down the energy needed to reanimate the bodies, learning and keeping secrets. The Children are <br/>\n<br/>\nMelna - a beautiful warrior women who strides to the battle field with no weapons, only to slaughter her prey with her many tenticals.  Leave little harm to the bodies.  Perfect for a necromancer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVelne - a shadow that can only be called with the light of a black onxi candle, but will enter the body and give necromantic power or as a way to set illusions and fake alignments on there creations so as not detected right away <br/>\n<br/>\nAecreva - A handsome male with a charming smile.  He befriends others, has them share there secrets and uses it to force the person to given him a part of their body or soul, which he then gives to the necromancer for the right price.  It is rumoured in the daemon realm that he has wrapped himself in the guise of a Eladrin to gain favor with his mother.  But underneath he is nothing but a swarm of snakes or worms.<br/>\n<br/>\nand here is some game mechanicy stuff from myself<br/>\n<br/>\nMelna's Presence<br/>\n<br/>\nYou invoke the dark demigod Melna, to perserve battlefields and bodies at the cost of more damage in general. <br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 12                          Component Cost 500gp<br/>\nCatagory Necromancy   Market Price        2600gp<br/>\nTime 1hr                         Key Skill: Arcana<br/>\n<br/>\nYou target an allied military or adventuring unit of up to 100 men.

This spell does not determine or show the content of these secrets, burdens or lies but anyone who has secrets, burdens, and lies appear to be encircled in dark rain at a strength porportional to the significance of their actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nBurdens for this effect are considered actions that a person would do that would weigh heavily on their conscience. Most average people will NOT have a burden, but a knight commander of the king's garrison or an executioner may for example.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCategory Necromancy<br/>\n<br/>\nThese rituals use the foul power of undeath, the deadworld and the undead in general to power themselves. Whenever a Necromancy ritual is cast a natural undead is born into the world (when and where is at the dm's discression) <br/>\n<br/>\nMost people consider Necromancy to be unholy and evil                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
