I'm wondering if any of you have advice, systems, thoughts on narrative wargaming.  When I read some cool background like Warhammer 40K, or Warmachine, I get all excited.  There's all this neat backstory and flavorful fiction that I want to be a part of. I want all these neat troops and to have these way over the top battles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I try to play one of those rulesets and hate it.  There's rulers, there's saving throws.  All this stuff that gets in the way of the narrative of the game.  It bogs down everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm wondering, does anyone have any thoughts on how to play something like WH40K in a narrative style.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I'd like to see:<br/>\n<br/>\n+ No measuring.  I don't even care if there's no battlemap or board, whatever, course I do want to use cool figures even if they are just on the table somewhere.<br/>\n+ Dice are fine, but rolling to hit, rolling to save, rolling to damage, rolling to see what part of the body is hit, just...isn't.<br/>\n+ Ability to drift to different periods, from fantasy to sci-fi, to Vietnam and WWII.<br/>\n+ 2 or more player competitive is great, solitaire would be cool as well.<br/>\n+ Has to build the story somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts on possible systems/subsystems:<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Burning Empires combat system.  I love some of the ideas here.  Wondering though if the mechanics would be interesting enough on their own as a battle.<br/>\n+ Something like competitive "3:16" would be really cool.  It's already WH40Kish in theme, but the interesting narrative from that game takes the side out of the battle, so I'm not sure if that would work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess when I try to summarize my thoughts, I'm looking for something tactical, yet not fiddly and story-driven, yet not freeform.  Does that make any sense?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218922/#Comment_218922" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T06:34:48+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  6:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Creating some sort of hybrid minis game with broadly S-Gish mechanics is a big interest of mine.<br><br>Here's a thread about a game I ran trying to create something like that:<br><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9426&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9426&amp;page=1#Item_26</a><br><br>The end result, IMO, is yo end up with a game that doesn't easily fit into any of the categories of wargame, RPG,, or S-G. Instead, you have something that is related to all of them, but different enough due to the constraints of the physical medium that it probably deserves a different name.<br><br>There are also some "fringe" wargames game designers who have experimented with similar stuff. The notable thing about their work is that a lot of it seems to hinge on the use of a fairly simple system and a neutral referee ( which is different from a GM in a way I can't quite describe well. I suspect the split comes in that the players of the game tend to be all at odds somehow, and the actions and conflicts are pursued by the players. This, I suspects, relieves the ref from the urge to meddle too greatly).<br><br>I have to run now, but I'd be more than happy to chat about this toipic.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218926/#Comment_218926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T06:47:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  6:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We hacked 40K to work with Meg Baker's 1001 Nights a while back.

Essentially, a piece can move as far as it wishes, provided it doesn't exit or enter more than two pieces of terrain and does it's movement in a straight line between only two points. If during the move, it passes through the LOS of an enemy unit, the enemy may fire on it.<br/><br/>Taking that concept and putting a broadly S-G sin on it, you can kinda do what you will until another player cares enough to contest that thing, whatever it is. That was essentially the basis mechanic behind the stuff I used in my game.<br/><br/>As for more anrrative, that's when you start digging down to the nitty gritty of character motivation. Even allies can be working at cross-purposes, even if only on points of pride. Similarly, enemies may find a common area of interest, even if it's "let's not kill one another today (altjough our men are fair game)" or "let's fight but not at the cost of X".                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218948/#Comment_218948" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T07:55:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  7:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Except for the measuring thing (you use Lego pieces to do it though),<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/results.php?term=mechaton&amp;in=Posts" rel="nofollow">Mechaton</a>fits your requirements IMO.</blockquote>\nI'll have to go back through my rules, but I don't remember any narrative in Mechaton (hope I'm not wrong about that).

What do you mean by "narrative?" Perhaps I just didn't read carefully enough.<br/><br/>Well, I can make up narrative when playing just about any game.  We played Agricola the other day and I annoyed all of the boardgamers by roleplaying out my little farming family and making choices which didn't appear to make sense from game perspective, but rather from how I viewed the family (didn't matter much as I won, and you can't argue with that as a strategy).  I guess though, I'm looking for something that emphasizes the narrative from the rules.  <br/><br/>Like say I wanted to have a Narrative Wargame about D-Day (to take 40K out of the picture for a sec).  I want something cinematic that people will remember after they play (not that I rolled a 20 that one time and he rolled a 1 on his save, or whatever, but rather what happened in the narrative of the game).  So, I take Saving Private Ryan as an example of how I want it to end up seeming like.<br/><br/>+ Storming the Beach<br/>    - Boats come up on beach.  Open the doors to deploy and troops start dying due to extreme German fire (long-range, heavy machine guns).<br/>    - Environment slows down the americans and works to the advantage of the germans at first.<br/>    - Americans have no heavy long range weapons to take out the machine guns, so they have to move up the beach to force a closer conflict.<br/>    - Confusion and fear.  Even though you have orders, your troops might still not be able to react effectively. <br/>    - Effectiveness of good leaders.  Inspire by doing.<br/><br/>So, one scene might be Americans trying to get halfway up the beach.  Germans have a big advantage as they can pick them off.  American's lose a ton of men, and those still alive are disorganized and scared.  They make it halfway up, but they have suffered losses and caused very little loss on the German side.<br/><br/>Next scene, American goal is to get to the bunkers themselves, the second half of the beach.  Germans still have some advantage, but not as much now as they are within range of the american rifles, though heavily defended.  Americans have a natural berm to protect them just a little.  <br/><br/>Then there's a zoom in scene where one small squad of American's take out a sniper nest.

And truly, only the minis you have or can acquire. Don't bother with "what-ifs" for stuff you don't have/can't easily substitute.<br/><br/>Then you come up with an idea for the situation based on the minis.<br/><br/>Then, and only then, start working on mechanics. And honestly, those mechanics can be extremely simplistic. They really only need to cover who has the talking stick when , how other folks can add stuff in, and what to do when people differ on what happens.<br/><br/>The only other thing I might recommend is that the players have some commonly held concepts about the characters/pieces and the situation.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>This thread is a bit of strabnge timing, as I'm currently over in a convo over at the Astounding Tales yahoo group, asking some of these same kinds of questions. One notable thing about those games, apparently, is that they tend to neither be terribly serious nor terribly competitive. it seems to be a more play-for-the-sake-of-play concept, if that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218982/#Comment_218982" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T09:29:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  9:29AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note, mostly relevant: I've had great fun running through ever-more-involved scenarios via BE's Firefight! system. Nobody's run an online arena combat using the system for a while, but I ran like three or four of them and I thought the resulting fiction was fanfuckingtastic. I think some of that is from conducting it online: There's less urgency to go back to the dice, more chance to think through what successes and failures look like. <br/><br/>Big battles IRL also typically generate a long papertrail in the form of emails, battle plans, correspondences, reports to/from HQ, requisition forms, secret spy messages, and so on. So there's that element to consider as well. That's no good for creating a you-are-there sense at the table, but it could be <i>very</i> good for creating a cool fictional experience at a more measured pace.<br/><br/>The thing that works so well in BE is the notion of zones: big amorphous blobs of space that are easily recognized for their strategic, rather than tactical, value. OTOH, Firefight!'s zone-based approach also leads to, IMO, a static battlefield. Two sides agree to clash over a set of assets. Mostly that's awesome, and in the Iron Empires setting it's pretty much mandated. But I think it's hard-ish to model a more dynamic agenda using it -- say, two sides both rushing toward a single objective, or one side trying to escape while the other side overtakes them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218988/#Comment_218988" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T09:52:10+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  9:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this sounds insane, but I actually did this with Solar System.

If a mountain range is interesting primarily because of a gap with a creaky bridge, you can create just that part of the mountain range. And you can ink things so that travel between locations or fire between locations is limited in some fashion.

It has a total commitment to character-based drama as a basic precept, which makes it an interesting challenge for war stories; you'd have to intentionally break the game to make it do traditional warcraft resolution, which is a good point here.<br/><br/>Still, it takes quite a bit of hacking to make SS do purely war-focused stories. Once that's dealt with, adding the miniatures and such is not that difficult. The end-result won't be entirely a war-game, though, in the sense that you'd just construct armies and fight it out. Rather, you'd still have a GM and many flashbacks to what happened before the battle and whatnot, whatever is needed to make the story go forward. Think of boy's battle anime like Naruto or Bleach; it works like that, except that instead of individual fighters you have generals who hate each other because of some imagined faux pas five years back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219050/#Comment_219050" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T11:51:54+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 11:51AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Creating the "world" in Archipelago reminds me a lot of creating a Firefight in Burning Empires, minus the tactical fiddlyness of the latter (which you may very well want for your wargaming). <br/><br/>Archipelago was designed to be a game about islands, but we've used it to play the Asteroid Belt and the colonial South Pole. You simply draw the Russian and English bases, and then note that they are a half day walk from each other and that's it.<br/><br/>Another game you might look at is Memoir 44. It's a very light WW2 wargame/mini hybrid that has a VERY simple resolution system using dice with different icons on each face. For example, you roll four dice and come up with two grenades, a flag and (something else). And so the opposing player loses two guys from the unit you attacked and has to move back one space. (I'm writing this from memory so I don't remember the dice exactly).<br/><br/>You could take that mentality, remove the concept of hexes and add in some nice story elements.

I know it is an obscure period but the concepts it shows work for lots of other settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game works like this: The players are all on the British side. It is billed to them as a role play game/wargame. They get a written description of the officer they command. Invariably the officers hate one another (and this is historical fact in Howard's games). There are also a couple of local scout characters - often one who is clueless but speaks English and a competent one who doesn't and my favorite character - the newspaper reporter.  Howard lays out a huge panoramic terrain board and gives the players 6mm figures so they disappear in the terrain (The Geronimo movie shows this effect). The players are asked "What are your intentions?" They say what they plan to do and then Howrd sets a turn length. If they decide to make camp then a turn could be 10 hours. If they are firing madly at on rushing Dervishes a turn might be a minute. The players have to scout out the enemy and along the way interact with one another (dysfunctionally usually). There are some pretty simple combat rules for when the battle actually occurs but the real fun of the game is the build up to the fight. The Mahdist defenders followed a basic battle plan of wait in ambush and attack when the enemy got close. If it was a WWII D-Day game the German defenders would have a similar preprogrammed responce. One cool thing about battle is you decide how many minutes of bullets you want to fire in a given turn. You only have 20 minutes of rounds so you have to be careful. You can resupply but as they found out at Isandlawana in 1879 if you can't do this fast enough you get a spear in the gut.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played SvP a number of times and found it hillariously fun. Once I was the reporter (who has to write a news article about the game) I worte my article at the start of the game and sent it off. "10,000 DEAD!" was the headline. I then told about our glorious victory. All made up of course. Another time I was an African scout who couldn't speak English. I found signs that the force we were trailing was much larger than expected. I was able to tell the commander that he needed to eat the heart of a lion to win this fight. He didn't get it so I went out hunting for the lion. After not finding one for several days I decided this mean the whitemen would lose so me and my hunters deserted. It was the right thing to do...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this game is over 20 years old but it is exactly what your wanting - a wargame RPG. It hits on cultural misunderstandings and petty rivalries and does not become trapped in the minutia of fighting. I urge you to read it. It's free so you can't beat the price.

I still have lots of material to digest, but what everyone's awesome ideas and suggestions have given me focus on is this:<br/><br/>1.  Overall campaign.  Ok, I wasn't even considering this aspect, just figured we'd throw down some troops based on the story so far.  However, after reading Joe Prince's Contender's hack, I'm most excited about that aspect.  I really like the idea and some of the actions/scenes are fantastic.  So, there will be some initial setting of the world and then maneuvering on the meta level while the tension builds and finally explodes into all out war.<br/><br/>2.   Map board.  Collaborative building up of the map.  I just read Archipelago, and love the general idea of building up the area. BE has something similar.  So, each player adds or describes a piece of terrain.  It's not "a stairway" but "The High Stair".  Not "a swampy area", it's "The Darkening Marsh".  Each piece of terrain might have modifiers, like if a stand is on the stairway, they get a defensive bonus.  If they stand on "Alistair's Holy Fount" in the city of the town, maybe it heals them up.  So, each descriptor has an effect on units.<br/><br/>3.  Forces.  These are going to be described in terms of stands I think.  If this is a one-off battle, each player has the same amount of points to spend on everything.  Otherwise it will be affected by the overall campaign (recruiting, training, etc).  So, each stand is like a squad, platoon, battalion (based on the scale you use).  I kind of struggled over how would you model a squad of highly elite soldiers versus a large rabble of unformed troops, but then decided one stand has a few models and the other stand has a bunch, but they are roughly equivalent.  A hero is a stand too, just maybe with 1 model on it.  Then, similar to terrain, you will tag units with one or two descriptors which affect how well it does in battle. <br/><br/>Obviously none of this is defined very well, so I'll walk through how I see it going down:<br/><br/>Players are doing a D-Day battle (to use my earlier example).  Each player has 10 points to spend on their army.  Haven't worked out points, but maybe 10 points is a light skirmish.<br/><br/>Both players set up the terrain.  This is based loosely on the historical battle, so there's the terrain zones are ocean, beach, dragon's teeth, sand dune, cliff, bunker.  I know, these aren't named, and making me rethink my earlier statement (which works better with Fantasy/Sci-fi).  <br/><br/>+ German player spends one of his ten army points to define the bunker advantage, which helps his defense. Or maybe he spends two points.<br/>+ American player spends one point to define the sand dune as a defensive advantage.<br/>+ German player spends one point to define the ocean as treacherous (troops could drown due to heavy gear).  <br/>+ American player spends a point to define the bunker as "close combat nightmare for the defenders".  Whichever side (probably the Germans) is on the bunker defending it will get a negative if the enemy is in close combat with them only in that zone.<br/>+ German player spends one point on the dragon's teeth zone to slow down the movement to the next zone.  When the americans try to move from the dragon's teeth to the sand dune zone, it will take them 2 turns instead of one.<br/>+ American player spends a point on stand of troops.  This is a squad.<br/>+ German player spends a point on a stand of troops.  This is also a squad.<br/>+ American player spends a point on another stand of troops.<br/>+ German player gives his first stand a heavy machine gun.  This shoots further or does more damage.  The German player can tag it with either, but each costs a point, so this turn he tags with shoots further.  Can shoot 3 zones (bunker -&gt; dragon's teeth).<br/>+ American spends a point on a leader for stand 1.  The leader gives the advantage of the guys not running away (or a less chance of that).<br/>+ German spends a point to modify his HMG to give more damage.  Now with both tags, he can shoot 3 zones and do double the damage.<br/>+ American spends a point to put a medic in stand 1...<br/><br/>Ok, you get the point.  Each player is kind of playing off each other in the first phase.  Trying to get the upper hand or deal with something their opponent does.  So, the German player has this one unit that's heavily entrenched (lots of terrain modifiers bought), with this tough weapon, while the American is going for more squads and some support of them (leaders, medics).<br/><br/>So, that's the setup and hopefully it's quicker in practice than even just typing it up.  Lots of paperwork, I guess, unless you can use tokens place on the terrain to say (+1 defense).<br/><br/>Now we play.  <br/><br/>Each player secretly determines an action for each stand they control.  <br/><br/>Actions:<br/>+ Movement is zone based (from ocean to beach, beach to dragon's teeth).  Not sure if it would always be that linear (although I really like that, reminds me of that "Up Front" cardgame), but maybe could be branching if not. <br/>+ Ranged combat, might normally be at 2 zones away.  In our case, the Germans spent more on extending this.<br/>+ Close combat is in the same zone.<br/>+ Defending formation (or hiding or something).  Drops attack value, increases defense value until unactivated by another action.<br/>+ Aiming.  Increases attack value while standing still.  Might be more suited for man-to-man skirmish.  Can't do anything that turn so you are a sitting duck until the next turn when you hopefully hit your target.<br/>+ Regrouping if demoralized or scared.<br/>+ ?<br/><br/>Actions are resolved one by one (initiative?).<br/>Combat is super simple, but not sure quite yet what to do with that.  Maybe something like M44, like was suggested.  Each attack modifier adds another die.  Each success not nullified by a defense causes a casualty.  Not sure what to do with casualties, since every stand represents a different number of troops, but equal of strength.<br/><br/>I know this is all kinds of disorganized and I'm still working on it, but any thoughts or concerns you have so far please feel free to comment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219636/#Comment_219636" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:20:15+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:20PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 1:29PM by komradebob.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds pretty good so far.

First, he uses zone/area movement*, and second because he does a sort of interesting campaign play, where the previous yera's battle results at the convention influences the battle he puts together for the following year's convention. That, and the fact that when i played, he was open to the suggestion of dumoping his own homebrew system, and going with Matrix Game arguments inytead ( sadly, we didn't get to re-play the game doing that exclusively).<br/><br/>* Specifically, check out the photos. That piece offelt with the blocked out areas drawn on randomly is something he ruses, not something specific to that game scenario. Among other things, he uses it o simplify things like LOS.

I like the board, though I'm quite enamored with only defining zones than mean something.  Gotta think about that though. <br/><br/>What gets me thinking though is the action cards.  I don't want cards, but "Sunstroke" is one of them.  Can a player during the setup stage spend a point to define "it's really hot" and units in this circumstance have a chance at Sunstroke?  Environmental effects, not just terrain and troops.  Then if he spends another point, he could define well stocked canteens for a stand of his own troops, which would null out that potential effect for his stand.  Opposing player can choose to risk a die roll and get the effects of heatstroke or spend the point to define his own stand to have more water.<br/><br/>How far to take that?  Can a player define an opponent's stand as "using inferior weapons" and thus have a worse chance to hit or might jam or break or something?  Thinking that could be nasty if tagging another players stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219656/#Comment_219656" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T14:17:22+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  2:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I would do if I was running a semi-freeform minis game again would be to start with some known inf or some suggested common occurences, then let the players themselves decide whether to bother pursuing it.<br/><br/>For example, if I were to use something like Matrix Game mechanics, I might start out by broadly defining some situational/environmental/political stuff that might have an impact, ut then let players hash out whether they wanted to expend one of their limited number of arguments to really bring it into play.

Maybe an infantry company just plain sits down after a hard fought melee to re-hydrate rather than pursue a retreating enemy. Maybe an out of water unit fights like devils to seize a well, or alternatively is slowed down on the march by their increasing number of heatstroke victims and starts moving much more slowly than their commanding officer had projected (possibly meeting a link up with another unit).<br/><br/>So, I don't know if you'd need to buy things specifically to hassle enemy units, if you've already got some general ideas handy.<br/><br/>For that matter, you could do something similar with combat effects of weapons. An HMG doesn't just kill peple, it also tends to make units hit the dirt or even withdraw to a safer area behind cover. depending on how you decide to work your mechanics, it might be just as viable to declare one or the other as the outcome you're looking for when you activate the HMG.<br/><br/>( Of course, early WW1 French might activate "Elan"  and charge the HMG instead...)<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Tangent:<br/>Regarding terrain, I know you used fantasy examples, but even in more historical based settings, bits of ground can take on a huge importance.

Problem is if you are sorta going cinematic historical and you don't know or want to research the actual names of things, you might not have interesting names for the zones.  I can't tell you what the beach is called.  If I made it up, might be Bloody Beach.  I think giving the terrain is important, just not sure how to do with if the game is historical, without some grognard flipping out due to historical inaccuracy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219661/#Comment_219661" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T14:42:25+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  2:42PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 4:59PM by komradebob.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going cinematic, I'd say ignore the Rivet-Counter type grognards altogether. Fictionalized versions of real world battles or even entirely made up kingdoms and provinces are a fine old tradition in minis gaming. I've been reading some old reprints of Don Featherstone* books from the 1960s, and they apparently regularly did that sort of thing when they gamed.<br/><br/>"Bloody Beach" or "Deadman's Hill" or bad faux-French names are perfectly fine, and I'd certainly encourage them.<br/><br/>Frankly, it's a whole lot easier anyway, and lets you as designer of a scenario concentrate of mashing together the stuff you find interesting.<br/>_______<br/>On a total tangent, one of the things I've been trying to figure out is how to make a minis wargame that is somehow competitive at the Scenario Designer level, rather than at (or, really, in addition to) the usual participant/faction level. <br/><br/>If anyone has any thoughts on that I'd love to hear them. I guess I'm thinking of something like a club or regular play group environment, whwere different players propose scenarios, then a winning scenario is created and played. After that someone else is challenged to put together an even betterer scenario (although not necessarily bigger).<br/>______<br/>Edited to add still more:<br/>Y'know, you might not have to use a point system at all if neither player knew ahead of time which side they'd play. You could easily do some thing like hand out 3 x 5 cards that say something like : "Side A: A positive tag for one specific one unit" ( and so on, with other side, terrain bits, environmental conditions, pre-set deployment areas, whatever) and then have the players fill them in.Then deal them randomly to both players.<br/><br/>Only after these were filled in and placed facedown in appropriate piles would players dice or otherwise decide who ewas going to play which side. Heck, for real-world type clusterf-s, you could even choose to make it wildly unbalanced. The goal isn't so much to "win" as to do well in your own personal Kobayashi Maru situation.<br/><br/><br/>* Donald Featherstone was one of the early guys to publish books about minis gaming, although not necessarily an early developer or player. His books more popularized something that was already occuring. You can do a search on Lulu to find the reprints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219690/#Comment_219690" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T17:11:18+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  5:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite><br/>What gets me thinking though is the action cards.

A unit leader might use its Tactics skill to manever an Aspect on the scene: "Too hot to march". Now everyone can tag it for advantage or use it to compel, though the placing player can free-tag it once. This is a very powerful generalization, enabling practically every skill to have a free-form capability that has simple and explicit mechanical effect.<br/><br/>There are other tweaks to FATE specific to Diaspora that fuel this (especially limited tagging by scope -- getting an Aspect on a scene or a zone is especially powerful because you can only tag one Aspect per scope -- character (unit), zone, scene, and so on.

How many at one time? Do they own minis themselves, and if so, what kind ( is everyone a 40K fan or several different things or...). What kind of space do you have available to you? What kind on non-people minis stuff ( terrain and so on) is available? Do you have any non-soldier minis you might use? Can you leave a table set up for more than a single days' play?<br/><br/>I'm asking because I'd like to compare what you're going after with some of this kind of stuff I'm thinking about, and I'm hoping similarities and differences might help some of it click into place for me with my own little projects.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>One other thing I've gotten wondering about too: I'm not sure that with miniatures games I'm as interested in competitive/gamist stuff, so much as an emulation/simulation bend. Like, I enjoy challenges and people challenging me, but there's something really important to me about winning by way of hitting the right notes on the source material, if that makes sense. I'm also getting a bit of that vibe from Codexier's description of the D-Day game he's positing.<br/><br/>Anyone care to comment on that?<br/><br/>Edited to add more:<br/>One of the things I've seen with dirty-hippy games ( in comparison to more trad designs) is that a player ( the real person) is not penalized for making characterful choices. In fact, it's pretty normal with dirty hippy games to build in character flaws, and let them out there for the players and the story developments to play on. Is there something of that general concept that migght be applied to a more narrative style of minis game, even a wargame? It strikes me that with war movies, the audience frequently knows or can see problems building, even if the characters can't, and that's engaging. In dirty-hippy games, there's frequently shared out of character knowledge that everyone plays towards. Can this be applied to minis wargames also, perhaps by changing what it means, not to win exactly, but to succeed in making an engaging story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220371/#Comment_220371" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T13:05:25+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  1:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, my aim for this game design is that it can be played between 2 people, with no GM or Referee.  I'm writing up what I have so far and have lots of examples and pictures.  I'm assuming that someone playing has miniatures, but one set of pictures uses post-its as the troops (with definitions and drawings right on them) on a whiteboard with drawn in terrain.  So, while I would love to always use great diorama quality miniatures and terrain, it's not necessary.  So, if you have a bunch of Heroclix figures, then you can make up a superhero skirmish.  If you don't have any figures at all, you can use index cards or whatever.  Pennies.  Dice even.<br/><br/>One thing I notice about a lot of there interesting comments in this thread is that they seem to pertain to all players on the same side.  Like it's an RPG with everyone on the same side and happens to have a battle element in it.  What I want is something a little different than that.  Competitive and gamist to a certain extent.  Creative and memorable even more so.<br/><br/>In the end, what I want is a game that can recreate playing WH40K or similar game, but only include the things that make the game cool.  If you want to play Space Marines, what is it that is cool about them?  Maybe one person thinks that their Power Armor is cool.  Or that they work in small squads.  Another person thinks that the weapons are what's cool.  What's neat about the design so far is that each person can define a troop however they want.  Even two different people playing Space Marines will have two very different troop types defined.  I just don't want to bog down into stat lines where I should be (but just can't bring myself to be) concerned with whether I have a 3 or 4 in toughness, etc, etc.<br/><br/>I almost envision what I am working towards as a game that creates a game as the output.  While everyone could collaborate and come up with Standards (ex. a Dwarf always has Iron Armor which gives a defensive bonus), I think the power is that if 10 groups played this game with a fantasy theme (even one that is highly canonized like LOTR or Warhammer), the end result after the setup phase would be VERY different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220474/#Comment_220474" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T18:08:17+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  6:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Universalis with a tenet like: "Scenes exist at different <i>scales</i>.

Universalis traits, the word matrix in older forms of Engle Matrix Games, the use of aspects in FATE/SotC inspired stuff... that all comes from a similar sort of thinking, and a pretty clever one at that, IMO.<br/><br/>One thing you may want to do for your test runs is to have a ready-made list of positive and negative qualities for the various stuff in your game ahead of time. Basically, like the stuff you were talking about regarding the various ways to view Space Marines. Don't have any of that stuff pre-assigned and make sure the other player is clear that those are example qualities, not a strict limit ( others can be created on the fly).<br/><br/>Please post about the experiment as well. I'm very much interested in how this turns out, especially the things that turn out very good or bad, and how the thing changes with a second game played especially if by the same two people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Narrative Wargaming - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9850/narrative-wargaming/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Narrative Wargaming - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9850/narrative-wargaming/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Ok, had a playtest scheduled with a friend, but he ended up not being able to come.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, had a playtest scheduled with a friend, but he ended up not being able to come.  My 7 year old son agreed to play.  That's ok, cause 1) I love to play games with him, and 2) I want younger people to be able to play this game and this was a good test if they could.  Hoping for another playtest with an adult this weekend or week coming up.<br/><br/>Playtest 1<br/><br/>Bearing Phase (Where the theme is decided and limits set):<br/><br/>+ We decided to play the Battle of Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings.  We agreed on a VERY loose interpretation of the battle.  Jacob wanted to play the evil side (with any evil character from LOTR) while I would defend the good city.<br/><br/>Battlefield Phase (Where the table is set up with terrain zones):<br/><br/>+ We had a big table-sized piece of paper that we used for the board.  We talked about the interesting places in the battle.  We drew the zones on the paper and then made a smaller map showing what zones connect to each other.  We created 4 zones in the Pelannor fields, and 3 tiers (of the 7) of Minas Tirith.<br/><br/>[Ruins of Osgiliath] -&gt; [Pelennor Fields (4 zones)] -&gt; [Minis Tirith ground level] -&gt; [Middle level] -&gt; [Top level]<br/><br/>Build Phase (Where the units are formed and terrain zones are further defined):<br/><br/>+ We used 15 points each.  We took turns and created the following:<br/><br/>Evil Side:<br/><br/>+ Warg Rider<br/>  - Bite weapons - Attack +1 <br/>+ War Mammoth<br/>  - Rider Archers - Ranged Attack<br/>  - Tusk Attack - Attack +1<br/>+ seige Tower<br/>  - Can render Gate effects null<br/>+ Sauron<br/>  - Strong Armor - Defense +1<br/>  - Shockwave - Attack +1<br/>+ Cave Troll<br/>  - Leather hat - Defense +1<br/>  - Big Axe - Attack +1<br/>+ Wyvern<br/>  - Nazgul Rider - Attack +1<br/><br/>Good Side:<br/><br/>+ Archers<br/>  - Strong Bows - Ranged attack<br/>+ Archers<br/>  - silver Arrows - Ranged Attack<br/>+ Gandalf<br/>  - Fire Bolt - Ranged Attack<br/>  - Booming Voice - Attack +1<br/>+ Faramir's Knights<br/>  - Cavalry - Move 2 zones per turn<br/>+ Hobbit Hero<br/>  - Short - Defense +1<br/>+ Trebuchet<br/>  - Experienced Crew - Ranged Attack<br/>  - Heavy stones - Ranged Attack (Normal ranged gives up to 2 zones attack.  Adding another Ranged gives 3 zones attack)<br/>+ Heavy Gate - Not a unit, but modification of Zone 6 which is the bottom level of Minas Tirith<br/><br/>Battle Phase (Where stuff dies horribly violent death):<br/><br/>+ Play was pretty unexceptional, except that for each action, the player had to narrate what happened.  <br/>+ In the end, the good side won, but just barely.<br/>+ We didn't set any victory conditions except "kill the other guy good".  Jacob moved his forces to the lower gate and after a turn of floundering, got his Siege Engine to the gate so that he could move his troops in easier.  All the while I shot arrows and dropped large stones on him.  When he finally got in, he took the lower level by destroying the 2 archer units, but it was costly.  At the middle tier Gandalf and the Trebuchet crew took out the last few units for the win.<br/> <br/>Playtest Critique:<br/><br/>+ The setup was the most fun.  It's really neat making these custom units that can do just about anything.  We had to come up with a reason to have the power.  So, you can pick +1 Attack, but had to say why, like "Sharpened Swords" or "Well Trained".<br/>+ Cool thing during Build phase:  I added a gate which slowed units down.  Jacob answered with a siege engine that would render the gate effects null if in the adjacent zone leading to that one.  I really like the play there with having to counter what someone else built.<br/>+ I don't like the dice mechanics I put in.  With the initial setup of units, the probability is not bad at all, but it doesn't scale up very well at all.  Wouldn't work well for very high powered units or campaign play where units get stronger.  <br/>+ The gameplay was fun, but seems like it can be more fun.  Decisions seem to center around getting units into position, which is what wargames are anyway.  I'm just not sure if the gameplay is deep enough. Will have to playtest more.<br/>+ Zones are great cause there's no measuring and they lead from one to the other.  However, I'm not sure what is the best method for creating, How many to do, how to arrange, etc.  <br/>+ We spent very few points (1 out of 30 total) on modifying terrain.  Considering phase before troop Build where you can only spend points on terrain modifications.  Again, have to playtest more, cause I'd rather not add more phases/complexity.<br/>+ It is pretty balanced.  Even playing my 8 year old, it came down to the wire.  He rolled terribly much of the game.  In the end, I think that this might be the root cause of the unexceptional game play.  Our game really boiled down to who was rolling better, but I wonder too if that's partly because Jacob just rushed in and didn't always use his units to the best of their ability.<br/>+ We played where each player took their whole turn, doing 1 action with each unit available.  Might work better with alternating units or some initiative system.  Perhaps secret assignment of unit actions and then reveal simultaneously.<br/>+ Jacob didn't buy any standard troops, like platoons of Orcs.  At first I kept trying to convince him that he needed to in order to make the battle seem real.  Then he reminded me that the orcs were there, just not defined.  In the narrative of the battle, there were thousands of orcs hurling themselves at the walls and hundreds of knights defending, but they didn't have any importance or mechanical effect.  That is very cool!<br/>+ Have to really emphasize that each point you spend on a unit makes it stronger and more wounds.  Sauron was quietly taken down by some normal archers off the lower walls of Minas Tirith.  <br/>+ The Build Phase took much longer than I thought it would.  Some of that was explaining.  Most of it was creativity.  It didn't seem like "too long" though, so I don't want to change.  15 points each took us about 20-30 minutes to define all units.<br/>+ Narration at each action went pretty well.  Sometimes it was just glossed over, but Jacob quite enjoyed narrating failure in the most silly way imaginable ("The Troll bends down to pick up a stone just as the archers fire at where his head was just a minute ago").  Jacob naturally gravitates to story, so curious how this will work with adults (both used to story-gaming and not).<br/>+ Interesting victory conditions might have made this even more fun.  Say if the evil side had just to take the lower level and hold for 3 turns.  I would have had to move more units and make a more desperate attempt to root him out from that spot instead of just lazily shoot at him as he tried to move up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220744/#Comment_220744" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T19:09:12+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  7:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of above:<br/><br/> Still working on Combat Mechanics.  I'm so terrible at probability and dice mechanics it's pitiful.  Definitely considering stealing someone else's design.<br/><br/>Combat mechanics for this playtest were:<br/>1. Close combat is in the same zone.<br/>    Attacker roll d10.  Hits on 4-10.<br/>    Defender roll d10.  Nulls hit on 8-10.<br/>2. Ranged combat 1 Zone Away<br/>    Attacker roll d10.  Hits on 6-10. <br/>    Defender roll d10.  Nulls hit on 8-10.<br/>3. Ranged combat 2 Zones Away<br/>    Attacker roll d10.  Hits on 8-10. <br/>    Defender roll d10.  Nulls hit on 8-10.<br/>Each "Attack +1" gives another pip on d10.  Ex. Close combat hit is on 3-10 (instead of 4-10).<br/>Each "Defend +1" gives another pip on d10.  Ex. Defense is now 7-10 (instead of 8-10).<br/><br/>Considering this change:<br/>1. Close combat is in the same zone.<br/>    Attacker roll d6.  Hits on 4-6.<br/>    Defender roll d6.  Nulls hit on 6.<br/>2. Ranged combat 1 Zone Away<br/>    Attacker roll d6.  Hits on 5-6. <br/>    Defender roll d6.  Nulls hit on 6.<br/>3. Ranged combat 2 Zones Away<br/>    Attacker roll d6.  Hits on 6.  <br/>    Defender roll d6.  Nulls hit on 6.<br/>Each "Attack +1" gives another d6 die roll.  Each success is counted.<br/>Each "Defend +1" gives another d6 die roll.  Each success nulls out a successful attack.<br/>This gives a more scaled combat where you can have pretty powerful units that would have little problems taking out lesser units and would have to fight against bigger ones.  This might lead to more unbalance though and players might only choose to Build heroic figures with many points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220746/#Comment_220746" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T19:16:18+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  7:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and my second favorite part of the playtest (other than the Build phase) was the realization to track damage by marking off the modifcations of the unit damaged and then finally the unit itself.  Very much like PDQ damage.  I like it cause there is no extra book keeping, and the units degrade as they get wounded.<br/><br/>Ex.  Cave Troll<br/><br/>+ Cave Troll<br/>- Leather hat - Defense +1<br/>- Big Axe - Attack +1<br/><br/>Gets hit for damage.  Player has to decide what to mark off.

The easy solution to preventing an army consisting entirely of heroic units would be to add certain limitations.  It could be something as simple as no one unit may cost more than 20% of your total point value, and at least 50% of your force must be comprised of "simple" 1-point or 2-point units.  Balance to your preference, of course, and if you create scenario rules, the limits can be forgone depending on the scenario (e.g. a 300-style scenario where a small group of heroic units face a vastly larger force comprised of significantly weaker foes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221083/#Comment_221083" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T06:22:39+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  6:22AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2009 6:24AM by komradebob.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite><br/>We had a big table-sized piece of paper that we used for the board.

Considering phase before troop Build where you can only spend points on terrain modifications.

At first I kept trying to convince him that he needed to in order to make the battle seem real. Then he reminded me that the orcs were there, just not defined. In the narrative of the battle, there were thousands of orcs hurling themselves at the walls and hundreds of knights defending, but they didn't have any importance or mechanical effect. That is very cool!</blockquote>\nExceedingly cool, I'd say. I suspect Jacob "gets it" better than a whole lot of experienced minis gamers would.\n<blockquote>+ The Build Phase took much longer than I thought it would. Some of that was explaining. Most of it was creativity. It didn't seem like "too long" though, so I don't want to change. 15 points each took us about 20-30 minutes to define all units.</blockquote>\nIf building is fun, don't change a thing.\n<blockquote>+ Interesting victory conditions might have made this even more fun.

As there are not a lot of zones, and these are defined narratively, there's not much you need to track other than your troops.  We've only gotten a couple of turns in, but the narrative is blooming (maybe because it is email).  I'm thinking this would work very well as a PBP game.  For this one, I'm visually tracking using Maptool (so I can take screenshots), but just playing out completely through email alone.  We used a random generator I created to pick a theme and came up with an Egyptian Mecha game.  You can see pictures I drew of the mechs so that we could play on a tabletop later as well at <a href="http://battlecreative.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">my art blog</a>.  <br/><br/>If anyone wants to do a playtest via PbP, let me know.

The gods tire of the battles of mortals.  So fragile are the tiny men, they offer little entertainment.  To their prophets, they give arcane knowlege.

Untold millions of faithful servants swarm behind the mechs pouring lifeblood into basins at the back of the mecha's feet.  These servants are often crushed mercilessly by falling debris, falling mechs and exploding shells.  Each turn roll d6 and on a roll of 6, the servants of Osiris have been unable to fill the vessel with blood.  The mechs cannot move and lose 1 Attack die.

My personal opinion is that "Nothing happens" is almost always boring, and it seems to be the result of a lot of these rolls. <br/><br/>I understand that sentiment.  I feel less like "Nothing happens", but rather "Nothing happens that you wanted".  In terms of the mechanics you might not hit the unit you were trying to harm, but in terms of narrative you can describe any effect.  Current rules have the other player describing the acting player failing.  It might be something silly like "right before delivering the killing blow, the Ringwraith trips over the hem of his darkly flowing gown" to more serious "all around the target, troops are struck down by the hail of arrows, one of which narrowly misses his head."  Failure can be interesting narrative as well and is usually more fun than success.\n<blockquote><br/>And another thing.

One thing to note is that I already stated I should have been clearer on how to define the troops.  Sauron was just another unit in our game.  That being said, you can narrate when Sauron fails to be:  Sauron gets pissed off and leaves the battle, Sauron feels that the ring is close to being destroyed and decides to forego the rest of this battle to get back to Mordor, or even that when the Archers fire at Sauron he is distracted enough that Aragorn (not a defined character, but can still be part of the narrative) sticks him with his reforged sword.\n<blockquote><br/>And a third thing. This:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite>Oh, and my second favorite part of the playtest (other than the Build phase) was the realization to track damage by marking off the modifcations of the unit damaged and then finally the unit itself.</blockquote>\nis very un-narrative-y and sounds unfun to me.

However, that's not due to units becoming stronger or weaker.  It's due to the losing player becoming more desparate and taking more risks.  From accounts I've read, people in battle do not become stronger, in fact quite the opposite. However, when you become weaker, you might take this last desperate gamble that if it pays off becomes the stuff of history or legend.  Have you ever boxed or sparred?  After about 30 seconds, your arms feel like lead, you are all kinds of dizzy and weak.  Yet, you are still looking for a hole in your opponents offense, that one point that you can exploit and if not win, at least even things up.  <br/><br/><br/>---\n<blockquote><br/>At this point, I'm very unconstructive and just pointing at problems, not possible solutions.

That being said, I very much appreciate your feedback and will consider the criticism offered.  If nothing else, I need to work on describing how to use the mechanics to make the kind of game that I am trying to make. <br/><br/>In the end, this is still just a wargame (and a rather simple one at that), and that is what I am shooting for.  A wargame that I actually want to play, with elements that increase narrative interaction, but still maintain some of the conventions of the original genre of game.<br/><br/>Thanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221403/#Comment_221403" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T08:19:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  8:19AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite>Oh, and my second favorite part of the playtest (other than the Build phase) was the realization to track damage by marking off the modifcations of the unit damaged and then finally the unit itself.</blockquote>\nis very un-narrative-y and sounds unfun to me. This way you'll have a battle that gets less and less awesome and less and less epic as play goes on. It's the curse of SO many RPG combat systems and it's probably all D&amp;D's fault. A thing they still haven't fixed in the otherwise brilliant fourth edition. An exciting combat should ESCALATE, not DEescalate.<br/><br/>What if: each "point of damage" they take accrues -- maybe call it desperation.  When desperation = unit weight (number of modifications or whatever), it is removed.  Prior to that point, desperation is a resource that can be called on for heroic actions, magical feats, etc, depending on the type of unit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221419/#Comment_221419" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T10:10:22+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 10:10AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>What if: each "point of damage" they take accrues -- maybe call it desperation.

I had noted early on to look into "catch-up" mechanics like some boardgmaes have.  Haven't gotten to that yet, but thanks for reminding me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221556/#Comment_221556" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T01:09:24+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  1:09AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2009 1:09AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite>From accounts I've read, people in battle do not become stronger, in fact quite the opposite. However, when you become weaker, you might take this last desperate gamble that if it pays off becomes the stuff of history or legend. Have you ever boxed or sparred? After about 30 seconds, your arms feel like lead, you are all kinds of dizzy and weak. Yet, you are still looking for a hole in your opponents offense, that one point that you can exploit and if not win, at least even things up.</blockquote>\nOh, that's definitely true. I'm a martial arts instructor and I totally know what you're talking about. But that's reality. I was taking a narrative point of view. If you want the loser to get more desperate, I think you need to design the mechanics to encourage that sort of play. The units simply getting weaker would not have that effect, I think.<br/><br/>For example, in an RPG conflict system I made recently, the effect of damage doesn't make the damaged person weaker. Instead, it makes anyone attacking her stronger. That means that the longer the combat goes on, the more dramatic and awesome the attacks are, instead of less dramatic and awesome.<br/><br/>That particular solution might not be right for your wargame, but something along those lines might be. The desperation points are a good idea. I'd keep them at a collective level, so the entire army gets desperate as units are getting killed. You can use the points for some desperate but dangerous acts, and if you don't use them, they build up. If they get high enough, your army will flee. That way, you get this feeling of desperation for both sides. The losing player can feel like she has a chance of turning the tide if she can use the points in just the right time and place, but she has to do it soon, or her army will flee. The winning side will get a bit fearful of those points and make sure not to make any mistakes that will lead her opponent to be able to use the points in a good fashion, but at the same time she might do some bold attacks herself in hope of suddenly spiking the opponent's desperation to a point where her army will flee. So it adds a tension and a tactical element, too. As well as a narrative one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221593/#Comment_221593" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T07:06:06+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  7:06AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's an interesting idea Simon.
