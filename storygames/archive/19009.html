Also, that whole "first session" thing. The procedural structures behind these rules have some petty utilitarian functions, and I'm not talking about "let's all make up a thing together, guys!" But let's start somewhere that might seem a bit odd.<br/><br/><b>Here's the question:</b> When your PC is in a familiar location (setting, society, their own daily life, etc), <i>how do you role-play your character?</i><br/><br/>You have a bunch of different ways to do this:<br/><br/>1. Set your game in the real world. This sounds pretty easy at first, but then you have the issue of whether you are setting the game in actual real locations that everyone at the table is familiar with. If not, somebody still has to make up these fictional locations that everybody is more-or-less familiar with in general. So, who does that? who draws the layout of your PC's local corner store? If the GM decides the ambush goes down there, somebody has to do it. And then how does the player, whose PC <i>knows this place</i>, role-play that familiarity?<br/><br/>2. The GM makes up the setting and the players start unfamiliar and become familiar through play. This is the basic setup of D&amp;D, actually: You go into an unfamiliar place and explore it and then you know what it's like. It's also beside the point, because we're not going to play through 35 years of my character's life. So this is not a real solution.<br/><br/>3. The GM makes up the setting and explains it to the players, who then try to role-play it accurately. Also similar is when everybody buys a published setting, reads it, and attempts to portray it accurately. This can also be pretty tedious, and is often what happens when you use the real world, because (as Ken Hite likes to say) the real world is the most complete published setting there is. This way also brings with it a lot of anxiety about whether or not you're "getting it right." It kind of sucks when you present something only to have somebody with expert knowledge tear it down (and then you have the problem of someone using expert knowledge to stifle and limit the game, instead of support it). Unless everybody has agreed to the challenge of trying to accumulate expert knowledge and live up to a certain standard or whatever, this tends to get you mixed results and also takes a lot of time away from actually playing.<br/><br/>4. Get players to detail the lives of their PCs. The whole thing pretty much, not just what they look like and how they act. This can be done within guidelines provided by the GM and/or the game, of course. <b>This one is really what I wrote this post to talk about.</b><br/><br/>Vincent doesn't explicitly say this is why you ask questions in AW, but... it seems pretty obvious to me. You (as the MC) get the players to give you details about their characters' lives and then you portray it and find ways to shake it up and threaten it. That's why all your prep is making threats and the first session is all about establishing how the PCs live.<br/><br/>This has several advantages: Because the player make it up, they already know how the character's life works, where they live, things they usually do, places they go. They're also already bought into it and invested in seeing what happens, because most people make PCs they personally find interesting.<br/><br/>The downside is that you can only do a certain amount of planning beforehand, because you don't know who the PCs are and what their lives are like. You need to find out who they are from the players and then start playing right away. So you're improvising the whole first session, and you don't get to actually prep something and give it any amount of consideration until after (and then you only have the time between two sessions to do it).<br/><br/>You can still do prep, in the form of optional stuff, but there is no guarantee you'll get to use any of it. This can include: pictures, characters, locations, items, and situations. Like it says in AW, the best way to do this prep is come up with some stuff that you like, and then if you get a chance to throw it in, go for it. If not, then not.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424532/#Comment_424532" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T22:07:35+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 10:07PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2013 10:16AM by Johnstone.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Now contrast this with dungeon crawling.</b> Typically, it's the GM's job to prep the map and then the players explore it. Sure, maybe they don't get to every place on the map, but you're still using the prep you did. And yet, still there's the directive to "ask questions" and "leave blanks." Personally, I don't like following rules just for the sake of there being rules, I follow the rules because of the results. So here are my thoughts on actually implementing these principles.<br/><br/><b>Prepping a Dungeon is Fine</b><br/>If the PCs are somewhere unfamiliar, I feel like it's the GM's job to make it up (in pretty much any game with a GM, actually). When I play a character, I prefer feeling like the unknown is an actual, real thing I am exploring, and not something the GM is improvising. So I like prepared dungeon maps, run by an impartial GM.<br/><br/>As a GM, I like having a thing that I already know is cool (I mean, I like it, obviously, or I wouldn't run it) to present to the players. It lets me concentrate on making up other things that make the game interesting.<br/><br/>As long as that dungeon represents things that are unfamiliar to the PCs, no problem. Since the game puts a lot of emphasis on who the PCs are and how that should matter, there's bound to be some intersection there.<br/><br/><b>Put the Dungeon in the World</b><br/>If you use a prepared dungeon, make sure to communicate to the players the things that you absolutely cannot change. Like, if you're set on running Lair of the Unknown, tell them it's set in a forest beforehand, so you don't have to figure out what to do when your players decide they want to be in a desert setting. Or if you spent a whole month dreaming up a million possible ways to use orcs, tell the players before they decide they want a humans-only game.<br/><br/>But also, when you're playing and asking them questions about the world outside the dungeon, make adjustments based on what that world is like. So you may ask stuff like where did the wizard learn her spells, what is so special about the fighter's signature weapon? And then you can decide that the liche overlord is a wizard college dropout, and that the orcs are refugees from the Glass Deathlands, driven out by the last bearer of a certain weapon...<br/><br/>Or even simpler stuff. One PC comes from a neighbouring kingdom and travelled her by caravan? So you decide the humans that are supplying the goblin terrorists with weapons are those same caravans. Another player says the kingdom outlaws vast underground structures like this, you decide the dungeon as built during the time when the Mad King Boulkhruf repealed that law.<br/><br/><b>Motivations</b><br/>The reasons why the PCs are adventuring in the dungeon are important too. Ask them why they are there, and then use that information. You don't have to be slavishly devoted to what they say, of course. Just because the thief thinks there is a mountain of gold at the bottom of the Caves of the Charnel Gods doesn't mean you have to put one in. But if one PC is braving the dungeon so he can find the magic sword Stonecutter in order to use it to defeat the Rocktopus which is threatening to destroy his hometown, he might be a bit disappointed to find some other magic item instead, even if you've written your own goddam Silmarillion about it. On the other hand, if the altar room in your dungeon map just says "powerful magic item" on it, you can decide that's Stonecutter, and bam! you know exactly what to prep for next session: the grim portents of the Rocktopus danger. The player is already invested, more so for actually finding the thing they cared about, and you know that prep will get used.<br/><br/>Alternately, if you feel uncomfortable with just "powerful magic item" on your map, learn to be okay with putting your Silmarillion back on the shelf and swapping it for Stonecutter when the player gives you a motivation like that.<br/><br/>Also, if you need to add rooms to the dungeon to accommodate a motivation (or details added by it being set in the world the players are describing), it helps to have blank space there ahead of time. So, leave some blank spaces on the map where you can draw new rooms. Maybe the owlbear has kidnapped one PCs dad? So now you need a room where the owlbear keeps him prisoner and feeds him cakes to fatten him up, but you already filled up the whole sheet of paper! Fuck!<br/><br/><b>Back in Town</b><br/>Once the PCs get out of the dungeon and go back to someplace familiar to them, you can rely on them for all sorts of setting details, but you will still have to bring situations to them. This is almost a reversal of the normal D&amp;D setup:<br/><br/>- In a dungeon crawl, the GM is responsible for the totality of the environment, and (in a way) the players are dictating what the situation is by choosing where the PCs go. They might not know what awaits them beforehand, but often they do, because they can hear monsters, or look into rooms ahead of time.<br/><br/>- In a familiar setting, in civilization, where there is a community and social organization, you can ask the players what the setting is like. If the PCs go places they've been before (according to their backstory), get the players to say what these places were like back then, and you an either use that verbatim or show the passage of time by altering things slightly (or drastically!). But most dangerous, adventurous situations are ones you impose on them through NPCs.<br/><br/>Also, time in dungeons is usually experienced continuously. You talk about most of the things PCs do from when they enter to when they leave. In familiar settings, you're either going to go with scene framing, in order to cut out the stuff that isn't very exciting, or you're committing to playing for a really long time.<br/><br/>So that's how I interpret the structures of play in AW, and how I implement the principles of DW. These aren't the only reasons to play like this, and there are good reasons to play in a different style. I like to play a bunch of different styles of rpgs myself, and that's what gives me the perspective to see which tools create which types of play, as well as why and how I would want to use them.<br/><br/>What about you?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424566/#Comment_424566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T12:03:05+00:00" title="November 21, 2013 12:03PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loaded questions are a useful tool because you can do more prep based on the assumptions of the questions you plan to ask.

Now, prepping that extended family of goblin loggers that you've been dying to use is much more productive because you don't have to worry that they'll be out of place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424639/#Comment_424639" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T20:22:20+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  8:22PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a fantastic overview of one function of "asking questions", Johnstone. I don't have much to add; you've covered it pretty thoroughly.<br/><br/>My favourite use of MC questions, though, is better captured by the AW wording: "[...] <i>provocative</i> questions". I want to feel out what the players consider important, what they care about, what they fear, and what kind of content they wish to include in the game.<br/><br/>In terms of building the familiar environment, you might say:<br/><br/>"So, the owner of the caravan - what's he like? What are his duties? Who are his lieutenants? How often does he contact you? How many guards does he have under his command?"<br/><br/>But in terms of looking for provocative content, you might instead (or as well, once you've got the answer to the above), say:<br/><br/>"The owner of the caravan's got a squad of underlings with a twisted tattoo on the back of their hands. How do you feel about him and his cronies? Has he done something terrible to someone you know? What's the scariest thing you've heard about him? What's the most surprising thing you discovered about him, and why did it change your feelings about him? When you wake up in the middle of the night, and your brain is still busy thinking up nightmares, what's the thing you're most scared he might do?"<br/><br/>Now the players are developing content for the direction of play. A game where your players answer, "He's the strongest guy around, so we have to obey him for now, but some day we'll be able to challenge him!" is a very different game from the one where they answer, "He's the one who stole my sister from my family when she was a baby and sacrificed her to the Blood Gods."<br/><br/>That's what I'm usually after with my questions: what do they fear? Whom do they love? Why? Who do they hate, what do they wish they could overthrow? What's the worst thing we're dealing with here? Etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424642/#Comment_424642" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T23:05:52+00:00" title="November 22, 2013 11:05PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a cool distinction.

Long before AW, Kult made me think that a good way to run things was to get the players to invent all the mundane details, so the GM can invent all the supernatural details. Unless maybe the PCs were already used to certain "supernatural" stuff, like they could already use magic. Since reality in Kult is all a lie anyway, there's no harm in letting the players make up that stuff too, if their PCs are familiar with it. So you could do the same thing in a fantasy game, where it's the unfamiliar things, not necessarily the "supernatural" things that are the GM's responsibility. It's only in straight horror those are the same.<br/><br/>This is a thing I wrote for Kult a few years ago as an example of this:<br/><br/>Two players show up at the GM's house to begin a Kult campaign. They both want something different than the normal setting, they've already been playing a bunch of cyberpunk games. They decide they want to play in some sort of fantasy world, where djinni-summoning Arabs developed what became the world's most dominant technology. They propose that there are two competing sides\u2014wizards of smoke and shadow who extract the blood of the earth, and the storm conjurers who build machines that run on lightning. They settle on playing a rebellious smoke wizard and a failed lightning-caller who defected to the other side.<br/><br/>So, what kind of magical abilities do they need? Really, they just need skills and they can describe what happens when they succeed. These really have nothing to do with Metropolis, Inferno, dreams, or their place in True Reality. It has something to do with the Illusion, because they are manipulating it, but in a way similar to science and technology. They are not really bending time and space. And so the game proceeds, with the GM asking many questions about what the world is like, and the players answering them. And then the GM introduces anomalies, some things that don't work the way they should. The players decide what countries exist, and who their leaders are. They decide what organizations their characters work for, and who their bosses are. The GM decides which ones are lictors. And of course, he can jump in with mundane details too, describing what the bustling market is normally like, and then describing how the player characters see one stall that is manned by otherworldly creatures the likes of which they have never seen before, nor even imagined.<br/><br/>A few sessions later, a third player shows up. But he has no idea what this fantasy world is like. The other three all try to explain it to him, but he doesn't really get it. It's too weird, and the other players have developed a great deal of short hand and jargon to go with their world. You know how role-playing is, it's just not the same for people who weren't there.<br/><br/>However, the GM realizes the game has arrived at something of a turning point. These two wizard-characters have discovered some kind of tear in reality, a gate perhaps. So the GM tells the new player to make a normal person from our world. He says there are two mental patients at a local psyche ward who have been having remarkably similar hallucinations, and asks the player how he discovered it. He decides he will play a reporter who was investigating possible malpractice at the psyche ward, and was told about these two mental patients.<br/><br/>And then this new player gets to describe the world, which is pretty easy, because it is the real world. He says what his job is like, who his boss is, what his colleagues are like. The GM decides which ones are lictors. This player can say what wars he covered, if he wants to, and what prizes he has won. The GM decides which ones the lictors can see through. Meanwhile, the other two players are now nutjobs turned loose in the modern world. They now role-play being totally out of their element, and being inept at navigating through society and the world.<br/><br/>At some point, they then return to the magical world, bringing the reporter with them. Now the wizard players go back to describing the world, which may actually be greatly changed since they left, and the reporter is totally gobsmacked to discover that the mad ravings of these two lunatics now seem to be entirely true. Have they become lost in Dreams, or are there really multiple dimensions, even parallel Illusions of separate origin? That's up to the GM to decide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424878/#Comment_424878" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T16:56:21+00:00" title="November 27, 2013  4:56PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add that as part of my 'facilitator's toolbox', I like to encourage the players to ask <i>each other </i>provacative questions. Or, if they ask me - as the GM - some aspect of situation / setting, then palm it off onto the player whose character is the 'expert'. Got a question leading to a <b></b><i>spout lore </i>about dwarven construction in the mines beneath Phoenix Mountain? Better ask the Dwarf's player then...<br/>Combine this with a 'Yes and...' imrov state of mind can lead you to a wonderfully tilited Status Quo (moves snowball), whose creation is at the behest of ALL the players at the table.<br/><br/>Some good rolemodelling I've discovered through this sort of play about the <i>sorts </i>of questions for the players to ask of one another's characters:<br/><br/><i>What emotion best describes how you feel about this situation?<br/>Tell us one pivotal moment in your relationship with [important NPC / Monster]<br/>How would you react if this happened [threatening change to the situation / setting]?</i><br/><br/>Go narrow first then broad and open. If you're struggling to get a player to open up with broad provacative questions, try narrowing the questions first and then make them broader after getting them into the roleplay.<br/><i>'How did you feel after you betrayed the guild?'</i> [your open-ended question]<br/><i>'Nothing really' </i>[player's response]<br/><br/>Follow-up with something like;<br/><i>'But you sold out your boss and mentor; Filch... You were in the front row of the market square at his hanging... Did his neck crack on the gallow's fall? Or did he dance the jig of death? What was his last words to you before the trapdoor opened?' </i> <br/>I tend to always follow-up with <i>'Why?</i>' or <i>'How?</i>' this qualifier can help you get specific information and a lengthier answer after you've asked a narrow or specific question. <br/><br/>Make sure to Listen to the player's answers! Asking provactive questions is pointless if you don't listen and reincorporate what the player has authored . Sometimes I can be guilty of formulating the next question or setting the scene without paying attention to the player's answer to the first. I find I miss great opportunities for follow-up questions if I do this, so I make the effort to listen to the answer and try and always follow up with 'Yes and...'<br/>More than likely, this technique will spark a conversation, which hopefully will lead to a <i></i><b>move</b>. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424891/#Comment_424891" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T01:38:16+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  1:38AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2013 1:38AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What about <i>answering</i> those questions? Is there a way that good players answer these questions that helps to build good setting material and relationships between the PCs?</blockquote>\nI don't know about DW, but in AW I think one of the best things a player can do is take these questions as an opportunity to answer <i>from their PC's point of view</i> as much as possible. Now obviously the question is directed at the PC, and the answers come from their perspective just as a matter of course -- but there are ways to play that up and to answer so that everyone else learns things about both the setting (the answer to the question) <i>and</i> the PC (how it is answered.) <br/><br/>Sometimes the MC asks the PC something and it is obvious to everyone that the PC's opinion on the matter is very specific/biased/limited -- this is easiest to do when the MC asks you what you think of an NPC, of course, or when the questions are specifically meant to provoke that sort of response; but there's always that opportunity, even when the question is about some larger setting detail, etc. The more subjective you can make your responses, the more room there is for other PCs (and therefore other players) to play off what you have created.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iain" title="Iain"><img alt="Iain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iain">Iain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424899/#Comment_424899" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T07:45:09+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  7:45AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this. You've covered pretty much everything I'd like to say, but I really think the principles of leaving blanks and asking questions adds so much to game content creation as a group. I'd even go as far to say as I think it should be extended to all games; though Dungeon World/ PBtA games lend themselves very well to an open world creation, there's nothing to say that you can't create game worlds with blanks and asking questions consistently, while using another system for the mechanics of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
