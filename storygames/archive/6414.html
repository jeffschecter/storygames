View my work here: www.kylemckenzie.net/images.  My paintings are of a fairly quiet, traditional style - contemporary mundane scenes (usually domestic).  I try to use slightly unconventional viewpoints to create an ambiguous viewer/viewed relationship.  My goal is to imbue common scenes with a sense of something uncommonly transcendent.  <br/>\nI realize that there are not many games set in middle-class living rooms, or that focus on ordinary people sitting at desks or eating dinner, but I would like to explore ways to incorporate my style of subtle, realistic imagery into the context of story-game illustrations.  I have read opinions stating that subtlety has no place in game design or production.  I would agree that this is mostly true of rules text, but I feel like there must be game designs that would benefit from the use of nuanced illustrations with a subtle and somewhat ambiguous narrative.  <br/>\nStorn\u2019s work on Houses of the Blooded seems to be one way of proving it:  By showing the game world indirectly through artifacts, he is allowing the viewer to invent the visual reality of the setting, but supporting them in doing so.  The artifact does not simply show you some awesome thing that could happen in your game, but it elegantly creates a connection to the world of the fiction which creative viewers will mine and interpret, producing a broader visual world than a snapshot of action, or a character portrait might supply.  The viewer does for their game world what an archaeologist does for the past.<br/>\nTo be honest, I am not sure where I am going with all of this\u2026 just some things I have been thinking about.   I am a graduate student, and have been eagerly awaiting summer, when I would have time to pursue my interest in story-game illustration.  Now that I finally have the time, I don\u2019t really know where to begin.  Ultimately I want to work collaboratively with designers, illustrating games that I will love.  But I feel like my own personal body of work is miles away from a typical illustration portfolio.  <br/>\nDamn, this is a long post (my first \u2013 I hope I don\u2019t inspire a character limit).  Summing up: I would love to hear any thoughts about my work, the role of illustration in story-games, or suggestions on how I should go about marrying my gallery work with the needs of game design.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKyle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141919/#Comment_141919" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T18:23:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  6:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, hombre,<br/><br/>Well, you have a style all your own, no doubt about it. And it's pretty cool. As a designer, I dig it, but I'm not sure if it's going to work for any of the games that I'm working on. <br/><br/>For starters, I can't afford color interior artwork, and I don't know many indie publishers who use it. Do you work with greyscale?<br/><br/>Second, I'm looking for art that illustrates concepts. Dudes and chicks with swords, things with tentacles, spaceships, and such. There are other game designers who feel the same way, and there are other game designers who have different criteria in mind. This just means that you must hustle a little harder to find work.<br/><br/>Third, presentation goes a long way. Right now, you don't have a site, you've got a directory with a bunch of huge images that I had to scale down in order to view on my screen. You could probably benefit from a site with an easy-to-access gallery of images that have been shrunk down for browser-based viewing. If you got any greyscale, separate it from the color images.<br/><br/>Fourth, there's no reason you can't apply your style to a different genre. That RetirementParty6.jpg image could work for a horror game if you decapitated one of the dudes on the ground, stuck a knife in one of the women, and splashed a little blood around. I don't know, toss in a six-foot tapeworm with a chainsaw and I'm sold. But that's just me. You could also have one of these middle-class living rooms, only it's full of dark elves sharpening their swords over the weekend. Or dwarves drinking beer (or quaffing ale or mead or whatever the hell). You get the idea.<br/><br/>Anyhow, don't know if this will help, but figured I'd give it a try. Good luck!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141924/#Comment_141924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T19:24:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  7:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2008 7:25PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kparasol</cite>Ultimately I want to work collaboratively with designers, illustrating games that I will love.</blockquote>\nOkay, so what kinds of games do you like now?

I was driving home today and thought to myself, "That guy is going to think I am crazy.  My samples don't have anything to do with his game!"  I find myself in a position of trying to tell designers that "No.  I haven't done anything like what you are looking for, but I can," which, I realize now, isn't very helpful to designers or likely to lead to rewarding work.  Sorry about that.<br/>\nI've decided that rather than rushing into this, I need to figure out how my artistic interests can relate to game design.  I was too eager to jump at the first project I saw (which was yours) even though your game and my art probably aren't a very good fit.  I really appreciate you giving me feedback instead of blowing me off as an over-eager newbie.  So, to address your points:<br/>\n1. Color.  All of my work starts as value studies, which could just as easily result in greyscale work as color.  I need to create samples which show this.<br/>\n2. Concepts.  This is where my work and most illustration differ the most.  Ideallly, I want to find projects in which I illustrate concepts subtly.  Dudes and chicks with swords, and other genre-specific concepts could find there way into my work, but I probably won't be satisfied unless these concepts are married with the quietness that is so central to my style.  I am mainly interested in creating scenes in which the characters feel real, placing them in a space, showing them living their lives.  That doesn't mean that everyone will be doing their taxes or watering plants, but that the images are integrated into a fictional reality, rather than as isolated examples.  I would rather show a space that a dude with a sword occupies, than an example which says "Here is what a dude with a sword looks like."  <br/>\n3. Presentation.  Yes!  I have been sitting on my domain for months, without the time to build a proper site.  I stuck those images up for you to reference, but I am going to put together a better presentation soon.  Lame, I know.  <br/>\n4. Style - Genre.   It's true that Contemporary Mundane is not a common genre for gaming.  Finding ways to incorporate some of my core elements into a variety of genre's is an important task.  Ultimately, there are formal/compositional concerns in my work that I am interested in applying to a wide range of imagery.  One thing I would like to explore in game illustration is creating images that show the artist's hand, playing on the ironic tension between one-of-a-kind originals and infinitely reproducible images.  <br/>\nThanks again for your feedback and suggestions, it has been very helpful in framing my thoughts.<br/>\nKyle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kparasol" title="kparasol"><img alt="kparasol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kparasol">kparasol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141934/#Comment_141934" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T21:24:16+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  9:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            johnstone,<br/>\nGood advice.  Making illustrations for games I like to play would be a good way to build a portfolio.

I can't quite put my finger on why that isn't what I am going for.  It is too easy in a way (how is that for self-defeatism), I want the work to address the game world world in my visual language, rather than overlaying the genre onto my imagery.  That's probably too vague... I will think of how to better explain this for a future post.  Thanks for the thought-provoking feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had entered Game Chef.

However, it has a veeery specific mood, and may well be too... hm... artsy? individual? different? to work as a book cover - at least for a mainstream role-playing game. Speaking commercially, the main function of an RPG book cover is to be an ad for the book itself, and people browsing will usually give the cover only a quick glance to see if it's something for them; the first impression is, for the most part, all you can expect potential customers to form. So if they go "huh - that looks weird", or even worse "huh - that's not a role-playing game", no sale. <br/><br/>However, I can definitely see it working for a more artistic game.

Illustrate a game. Most designers would jump at the chance (partly to have free art, of course).<br/><br/>Admittedly, your everyday style won't fit most games. But there are many it will fit.

But there are definitely games out there you could illustrate.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141972/#Comment_141972" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T07:46:12+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  7:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kparasol</cite>I agree that some minor tweaks could make some paintings relate to modern rpgs, but ...

You have to feel right about the work you do, and if you feel uncomfortable just adding tweaks in order to make sales, then don't. Just make sure you can articulate where your boundaries fall, so people will ask you for stuff you want to do.<br/><br/>As Graham says, you don't really need a portfolio. Hell, you don't need Game Chef either - just issue a challenge on the forums here for people to make a game from your art. But if you want to work in a variety of genres, I'd suggest doing a couple genre pictures. All you need is one picture of a dude with a sword - just one - and you can always point to it and say "See? I can do fantasy. I just do it my way." And maybe a sci-fi pic too, if that's at all interesting to you. That will how people which elements are integral to your style - introspection, quiet moments, and strong characters, it sounds like - and which aren't. It will also give prospective employers/partners the confidence to trust you with a genre substantially different from your current work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Who is it that's working on<b>Cheap</b>?

Do four or five black &amp; white illustrations for a game you'd want to play (except it doesn't exist), pick a deadline, and issue a challenge. "Design a game inspired by the art." Any designer who submits an entry by the deadline is granted rights to use the artwork for their game. But for the designer who "wins", in your wholly subjective determinination, by creating the game you most want to play, do full color cover artwork to their specifications, and maybe a couple of additional interior illustrations to their specifications as well.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141984/#Comment_141984" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T09:17:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  9:17AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me weigh in. <br/><br/>I've talked to many art directors over the years.  Here is a brief list of things that any aspiring illustrator HAS to show GOOD art directors they can do.<br/><br/>1)  draw hands.<br/>2)  draw feet (if you cut off feet at the ankle, sure sign you are not putting the work in to learn how to draw feet.  If you can't learn to draw feet, how can you learn to draw a locomotive... or a horse?  It is a litmus test.<br/>3)  people sitting and standing interacting in an environment in one illo.<br/>4)  Tell a story.<br/>5)  Be able to reference research... that isn't just a car... that is a honda accord.  That isn't just a facsimile of a rifle, that is a WWII infantryman carrying a Garand.<br/><br/>If you can show art directors you can do those things... you will get work.  <br/><br/>Now, you specifically... I think you do have the beginnings of something marketable.  But you need more examples of the range you can do.  Absolutely, having the card players in some Unknown Armies supplement would rock.  But can you also handle Dictionary of Mu?  Could you work something that would be good for Spirit of the Century?  Or Mortal Coil?<br/><br/>Right now, I see a very Hopper-esque sensibility.  Which is very, very cool.  But it needs to push into illustration.  Illustration comes from the word illuminate.  As in illuminated letters.  In other words, what we illustrators do, is support the written word.  We tell stories.  We SELL Stories.  It is commercial, pure and simple.  Your pieces *could* be considered illustration in the right context, but right now, are sitting fine by themselves as fine art. They have a fine art dialogue.   They are not really geared to being illustrative.  And that is okay... when you can drift this style with a bit of what i'm talking about... I believe  you will be in some really, interesting, fertile territory.  <br/><br/>practice, practice, practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kparasol" title="kparasol"><img alt="kparasol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kparasol">kparasol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142079/#Comment_142079" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T14:53:36+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  2:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2008 2:54PM by kparasol.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you everyone for the feedback.<br/>Putting forth images from my gaming perspective into a design challenge sounds like a great idea - that is where I'll start.<br/><br/>Storn - thanks for the advice, and the Hopper observation made my day - there are few things that please me as much as when people recognize that influence without prodding.  I see what you mean about needing to push that more towards illustration, but man I would TOTALLY play a game with <a href="http://www.ima-art.org/cHopper.html" rel="nofollow">"Hotel Lobby"</a> (as is) on the cover!   That painting suggests so many rich narrative possibilities, without really pinning any of them down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
