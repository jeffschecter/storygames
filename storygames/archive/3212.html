A random high school class is kidnapped to an island.  There, they fight until only one student remains.  It's a big circus in the future fascist Japan.)<br/><br/>The game would be something where you could choose/roll student alignments / races / genders and then have some kinda interaction mechanics that would govern how easy it is for students to trust or fight each other.  By alignments, I mean the Breakfast Club kinda stuff--jocks, delinquents, nerds, druggies, goths, etc.<br/><br/>It could use a Riddle of Steelish mechanic where when two characters encounter each other, they simultaneously throw a die -- red die = conflict, white die = diplomacy.  So there's tension to encounters.<br/><br/>It could have a MLWMish endgame where if enough trust is built up among enough students, they can take down the system.  Or, if you like, you can play for the solo win.<br/><br/>It'd have quick NPC-generation rules, and with rules for jumping back in if your character gets wasted.<br/><br/>Maybe it could have an American Idol frame, with running commentary from the game master, popularity awards, interviews, side battles between uninvolved family members.  That might be lasersharking it though.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73195/#Comment_73195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T12:02:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 12:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, with spotlights for characters like in InSpectres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73196/#Comment_73196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T12:04:11+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 12:04PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2007 12:50PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen <a href="http://atarashigames.wordpress.com/about-classroom-deathmatch/" rel="nofollow">Classroom Deathmatch</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73209/#Comment_73209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T12:48:57+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 12:48PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Have you seen Classroom Deathmatch?</blockquote>\nNo, I haven't -- thanks for the pointer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73264/#Comment_73264" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T15:03:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  3:03PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Maybe it could have an American Idol frame, with running commentary from the game master, popularity awards, interviews, side battles between uninvolved family members.

Working together slowed down progress, but made things easier, whereas going it alone increased the speed the ending approached, but also made things more dangerous.

All players, dead or alive, have the ability to frame scenes and introduce conflicts. Each player also has the responsibility of describing the Successful or failed actions of at least one other player. so even if your character is dead or currently out of the scene there is still plenty of stuff for you to do.<br/><br/>Of course, character death is only a minor stumbling block. When your character does die (and he or she will almost certainly die at some point during the Classroom Deathmatch) you'll simply draw a new characterfrom the character pile and jump right in.<br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
