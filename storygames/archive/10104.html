For all its lack of any real scientific rigor, I think it makes a sort of intuitive sense--I can see the same correlation for me (though I also add "social engagements" to the "challenges" list).<br/><br/>So, as a combination of poll and sound board:<br/>* Do you find that you gravitate towards simpler games when busy at other activities, and more challenging or complex games when generally bored with the day-to-day?<br/>* Presuming we find a strong correlation, what can we do to introduce, market, and promote games to take advantage of this tendency?<br/><br/>Could THIS be the crux of the whole "mundanes don't like crunchy games" notion: they are too challenged by daily life (work, kids, social) to have the patience and "head space" to learn a high-crunch game? Is this why "the new wave" of games (both RPG and PC) seem to do MUCH better in the market when "casual" or "rules light" or "tightly focused"?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224251/#Comment_224251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T10:24:33+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 10:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking strictly from the armchair, there seems some sense in this.

It is like scheduling\u2014your friends who work 50 hours a week always manage to have time, while your couch-surfing friends can't ever seem to make it. There is a general trend towards simpler activities across the board. A hundred years ago, people would read long novels just to keep busy. When you have work, kids, the internet, tv, movies, baseball, and a zillion other things to distract you, taking time to master something is less appealing. This is partly related to the fact that rural people are used to being jacks-of-all-trades, while city folk are used to being hyper-specialized.<br/><br/>Then, there is the (probably exaggerated) notion that Americans are more extroverted and stupid, while other cultures are more introverted and intelligent.<br/><br/>But what do I know? I've lived my whole life at 11, and I have studied games since I was old enough to hold a crayon in hand. Work is irrelevant to my engagement with games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224269/#Comment_224269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T12:09:58+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 12:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would guess that stressful lifestyle = simple preference but that complex challenges = complex preference. Generally, folks who choose to engage in complex challenges do so because they enjoy mastering complex systems, and this would carry over to entertainment.<br/><br/>But thinking about it, this is nuanced because many of the most system-centric people enjoy elegant systems but don't enjoy unnecessary complexity for its own sake. Usually, the simple, elegant solution requires a much more complex understanding than the complicated solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224287/#Comment_224287" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T12:44:40+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 12:44PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to distinguish between crunchy and deep games. Go is an obvious example; not many rules (ergo, not crunchy), but still deep.<br/><br/>My tolerance for "crunchy" games is tied directly to the amount of time I have to establish rules mastery over the game. This has been the biggest barrier for me to get Mouse Guard or Burning Empires to the table. I need to learn the game before I can teach the game, and both of those games have a high crunch factor. So, yeah, life and kids and such interfere with my ability to engage with a crunchy game.<br/><br/>However, for my analog gaming, I will invariably prefer a deep game to a shallow game. In fact, the more stressed I am, the more I want to play a deep game. I think that this is because a deep game is generally rational. Stress often comes from facing a lack of control in one's life, and a deep game (especially a deep board game) can be a ritual of order, a haven from an insane world, a place where the rules are knowable and controllable.<br/><br/>So, that's my nuanced answer.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224417/#Comment_224417" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T00:04:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:04AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 5:40PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crunch vs. Deep is a good distinction. <br/><br/>The rules of Go:<br/>   1.

Yes, there seems to me to be a good bit of nuance to this question. In general, I tend to agree with Julian in this, and also this the crunch vs. depth thing folks are mentioning fits here as well ( especially after Caesar_X introduced me to several German-style board and card games).<br/><br/>I think there may be a couple of other things to consider, (especially when this concept is applied to rpgs/sgs).<br/><br/>How often do people play a given game?<br/><br/>My guess, based entirely on personal experience, is that people who are engaging with a game regularly, are going to add depth and/or crunch, no matter how the game as written starts out. However, the style of crunch/depth they add in on their own is going to in some way reflect what they see in the original game mechanics or what they ae utilizing of those mechanics.<br/><br/>For example, in a relatively lite'n'tight rule-set that is engaged with regularly, I would expect players to add depth in terms of characterization and world-builing and developing plot/storyline. I would expect a similar trend from players who were technically using a crunchier system, but one they themselves weren't engaging fully ( the classic mainstream sort of RPG, for example, on the character players' end of things).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
