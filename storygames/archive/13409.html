Has the issue of "I seize his life by force" been settled?<br/><br/>In other words, does "seizing someone's life" completely bypass the harm rules, or not? How so?<br/><br/>2. When two player characters get into a fight, what does it look like? Do we have to go to battle rules (i.e. enforce the two players taking turns to make a move)?<br/><br/>If you use a move on me, can I interfere with it? <br/><br/>If you attack me and roll a miss, does the MC inflict harm on my behalf, or what? What happens?<br/><br/>3. We're in a room together. You say, "I grab the door handle and run for it like crazy!" I say, "I shoot you as you run away!"<br/><br/>How does that work? Going aggro would always give the fleeing character the option of getting away without getting shot, it seems. Acting under fire for the fleeing character seems a little more likely, perhaps. But then it's totally out of the hands of the aggressor, which is odd given that he's really the active character in the scene, in a way. And does the shooter get to roll to interfere with the fleeing person's move, if that's what's going on?<br/><br/>I find this confusing.

PC vs PC combat isn't better defined than any other combat: someone who wants to take the initiative says what they're doing, and you roll for it. Opposing someone's move with an Interfere roll can be done, as described on p. 207.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 3: Going aggro doesn't always allow for run away, if you do the "I want you to get shot, or I'll shoot you" thing that's described in the book somewhere. If you roll 10+, they'll have to choose between getting shot or sucking it up, meaning getting shot. On 7-9 they can get the hell out of your way, so, you'll have to roll good to shoot someone who's all about running away. If anyone of them makes a roll, the other can interfere (though to do it they must do it, so if one player rolls act under fire to escape the shooter, the shooter might have to raise to actually following out the door in order to get an intereference roll). If the fleeing character is a PC and the shooter an NPC, then the latter can't roll so acting under fire it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't know about 1. My personal call would be to bypass the harm rules for NPCs (since I'm looking at them through crosshairs anyway), but not for PCs. Taking definite hold of a PCs life would pretty much be to make them still be at your mercy after the first shot - say laying at your feet or still in your stranglehold, so you can pretty much roll again without doing much more. If the victim PC is still conscious however, they could get another chance at interfering. Not taking definite hold would open for the victim to roll, say, acting under fire or fuck this shit right after surviving the first seize roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302311/#Comment_302311" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T00:54:05+00:00" title="November 26, 2010 12:54AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I don't think this is an issue. I guess it depends on your group's preferences, but the book tells you to look through crosshairs and don't try to protect your NPCs, so if it's a NPC who had his life seized by force, and taken definite hold of it, yeah, they're dead. If it's a PC you might jockey it a bit, but both parties will probably take a lot of harm. One option, instead of just killing them would be to bring them to 12:00 and leave them at the other character's mercy. "Do you really, really kill them?"<br><br>But in general, the answer is yes, if a life is seized by force, then it's seized. You might also want to look at <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/11/aw-seize-by-force-is-peripheral-move.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> by John Harper, about how Seizing by Force is/should be a peripheral move.<br><br>The book also gives you examples like this for Going Aggro. If I sneak up behind you and slit your throat with a knife, I'm going aggro and what I want is for you to kneel over and die bleeding. You can either do as I say (and die) or suck it up and take damage from the knife and then we fight it out.<br/><br/>2. I wouldn't say you should go to the battle rules. Just make sure everyone's got their chance to react and respond. After each move say "what do you do?" etc.<br/><br/>If you can describe how you're interfering with them, sure you can. But frankly, do you just want a -1 on their roll or do you want to break out a move of your own? So a) make sure you have fictional support for your interfering and b) is it worth it?<br/><br/>If he misses his attack, then the MC makes a hard move. One of which would be to turn over to you and say "what do you do?". They just blew their roll, and now it's "your turn". That's pretty hard in itself. I wouldn't inflict harm as a MC, unless it was specified by the move that there is harm involved.<br/><br/>3. Whoa whoa whoa. Why are you running away? Did this actually happen in a game? What's the reason you bolted? That tells us whether you're acting under fire or whatever. Was he aiming a gun at you? What was happening?<br/>If not, you're doing it. You grab the door handle and are running. Then the other person shoots after you. What is he doing? Is the trying to kill you? Stop you from running? Just scaring you with the bullets. Either way, it's Go Aggro or Manipulate. If it's Go Aggro, he says what he wants you to do and rolls and you do it, suck it up or do something else, depending on the roll. If it's manipulation and he rolls a hit, you can stop and mark XP or <br/> you don't and it's his loss.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302312/#Comment_302312" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T01:17:56+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  1:17AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I don't really see an issue there either. If you are seizing someone's life by force, what are you actually doing?<br/><br/>a.) If you are grabbing his body and chopping it up with a machete, and he's fighting back with his knife, then no, you don't bypass the harm rules. You take harm. I mean, he's fighting you with his knife!<br/><br/>b.) If you are shooting him with your assault rifle from behind a bunker 30 yards away, then you're not really seizing his life by force, are you? You're Going Aggro.<br/><br/>c.) Are you seizing his actual life, like his soul, and imprisoning it in a psychic prison or something? If the established harm for that is no harm, then you don't need to worry about taking harm when you do that. But can you do that? (This happened in one of my games.)<br/><br/>2. If I say "I shoot Paul's dude in the back" then I roll to Go Aggro. If I miss the roll, the MC makes a hard move. That could be "a mortar goes off next to you, you can't see him anymore" or it could be "your gun jams, Paul's dude hears it" or it could be "just as Paul's dude whips his machete around, you step forward and catch it full in the face, take 2-harm (ap). Hey, Paul, you notice Johnstone's dude was about to shoot you as you turned around and bumped into him."<br/><br/>If you can interfere in my Go Aggro, you can interfere. How are you interfering?<br/><br/>If my dude pulls out his machete and charges your dude, who does the same, we both roll to Seize by Force. We can both interfere, if we can both interfere. If I flub both rolls and you Seize me by Force, I'm really, really fucked, though, so I might not want to interfere and just take my chances. Probably you take harm too, though, since we are both fighting each other with machetes.<br/><br/>If it's a battle, sure, take turns. If it's not a battle, hey you could take turns anyway. Whoever speaks first rolls first. So if I charge you first, I roll first. Then you can try to seize me afterward, if you're still able, and I'm still on my feet. Or roll them at the same time, whatever. Your call.<br/><br/>3. When I run for the door, am I just running for the door, or am I Acting Under Fire? If I'm Acting Under Fire, why?<br/><br/>If you shoot me after I run for the door, then I'm not Acting Under Fire because I already ran for the door. You're Going Aggro when you shoot me, and I can interfere with your roll by running for the door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302314/#Comment_302314" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T02:18:47+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  2:18AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone: the issue with "bypassing the harm rules" isn't about you not taking harm when you seize someone else's life.

But in this case, you still have to go by the fiction. You can't literally seize someone's "life." If you want to kill someone, you have to seize their body, then dispose of it. When you hurt somebody in the fiction, you deal out harm mechanically. If you have somebody helpless and you say "I cut off his head," that's when you bypass the harm rules. If he's resisting, you can't just cut off his head by taking definite hold of him. You can take definite hold of his head, and then if he doesn't manage to get free, you can just cut it off.<br/><br/>I mean, there's leeway for seizing control of the situation and stuff, but mostly, it's actual physical things you're seizing control of. The "trade harm for harm" part of it is part of the struggle over the thing you're seizing, and once you have control over the thing you're seizing, whether it's a person or an object, you can dispose of it as you want.

Mechanically, speaking I mean.<br/><br/>What does it look like?<br/><br/>a) and b) and c) Let's say the Hardholder and the Chopper meet for a duel. They've got their gangs around them and they're gonna fight until one of them is unconscious. The winner takes the newly discovered unexploded bomb home with them. This is a great situation for simultaneous Seize by Force rolls. I'm having trouble thinking of a situation where you'd have a simultaneous roll and not be able to interfere. Based on your Hx, you might not want to risk it, but when the fiction would prevent it? I dunno.<br/><br/>d) and e) Take you're example of me running for the door and you shooting at me. I run for the door first, especially if you shoot at me because I run for the door. That's obvious. I could say I shoot back, but if I'm not trying to Seize by Force, I would say shooting back is interfering with your roll. Especially if I'm just trying to escape. So, first I go: I run for the door. Second, you go: You Go Aggro, and probably I want to interfere with that. If I don't get shot to shit, then I go again. Probably I just run out the door, since you already made your move. But if I decide to turn around and gun you down for serious now, then I'd roll to Seize by Force. Probably you can interfere with that, but since you just made a move, I'd say it's only fair I get to make my move now, instead of us rolling for Seize by Force simultaneously if you're not backing down when I start shooting back.

Simultaneous moves, what?  Follow the fiction!  There aren't simultaneous moves in Apocalypse World, at least not in most situations I can think of.  Instead, one person does something (which could be a move or not) and the somebody else does something (which could be a move or not).  If somebody's making a move you don't like, you can try to interfere.

The interesting part is *why* people are shooting at each other or trying to kill each other, and the *why* of the situation, as well as the details, is how you choose what moves are going on.  <br/><br/>For issue 1: can you seize a life by force?  I'd say, with NPCs, of course you can.  If you take definite hold of an NPC's life, that means you get in a position to kill him, then and there -- you have their life in your hands, but they're not dead yet, and I-the-MC get to make a move now.  Most of the time, I'm looking through crosshairs and being a fan of the characters, so the move I make is going to be informed by that: is it going to be cooler if the NPC just dies, or do I want to raise the stakes by offering an opportunity with a cost?  For PCs, I'd probably say much the same thing, only the other PC also has the option to interfere.  "Okay, so you're not quite sure where you lost control, but there was a scuffle, and Balls wound up on top of you.  There's blood running from his nose and he's got a nasty cut on his arm [you inflicted 2-harm on him], but you're feeling pretty beat up too, and one of your eyes is swelling shut [he inflicted 2-harm on you].  He's got both hands on your throat, and you're having a hard time breathing.  It's obvious he wants to kill you.  What do you do?"<br/><br/>As far as the simultaneous thing:  follow the fiction.  Someone is acting, and someone reacting.  The person acting is making a move; the person reacting is either doing nothing, helping or hindering, or making a move once the first move is resolved.  It's not really whoever speaks first, although it's likely to coincide with that a great deal.  It's also not going to happen right out of the blue that one character says "I seize his life by force!" -- there's going to be a setting and a backstory, possibly some interaction (opportunities to read the situation and the other character).  <br/><br/>For issue 2: I think it's implicit in the rules (but unfortunately not explicit) that anyone gets to respond to a move with another move, once the first move is resolved.  If Player A tries to seize Player B's life by force and fails, the MC gets to make a move in response to that, and Player B gets to make a move in response to that as well.  <br/><br/>Now, of course Player B can also interfere with Player A, but remember: if you do it, you do it; to do it, you have to do it.  *How* is Player B interfering with Player A? Again, if you play with just the mechanics, it gets boring fast, because the mechanics are meant to support and enhance the fiction, not to replace it.  "I seize his life by force." "I interfere."  No - what you want is, "Before he knows it, I have my machete out, and I'm tackling him with it.  I want to have him on the ground under me, at my mercy.  He's armed, so that's seizing his life by force."  "I have warning?  I'm going to try to get my arm up near my neck, so that if he succeeds he won't be able to cut my throat, and try to punch him in the face.  That's interference."<br/>And for example 3, there are two ways to model it.<br/><br/>Player A opens the door and flees.  Player B opens fire to prevent him from running away.<br/><br/>Model 1: Player B goes aggro on Player A.  The desired behavior is to stay there.  If Player B rolls a hard success (possibly with Player A's interference), then Player A gets the choice to get shot and run away, or to stay there and not get shot.  If Player B rolls a soft success, Player A gets an expanded list of options, which can be interpreted as getting away without getting shot.  Them's the breaks: Player A was not as intimidating as he thought, or not hard enough to pull the trigger fast enough.<br/> <br/>Model 2: Player A tries to escape, and so is acting under fire, with the fire being, well, gunfire.  Player B can interfere with that, of course. If Player A rolls a hard success, the character gets away.  If Player A rolls a soft success, the GM gets to offer a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice -- "You get away, but you take 2-harm from bullets." Or, "You can get away, but *only if* you take 2-harm from bullets." <br/><br/>But the question I'd ask is, fundamentally, why are two PCs trying to kill each other in the first place?  And the question there is not meant to imply that they shouldn't be.  But if they are, there's probably some context that's developed for it, and that would really inform a lot of the decisions I'd make if presented with this.  And part of the reason the questions are so tough is that they're so abstract: when you get to the point where PCs are trying to kill each other, you should have a lot of history and context to work with.  <br/><br/>(If I had two characters who wanted to kill each other from the opening moments of the first session, I'd point them at page 101: "Your characters don\u2019t have to be friends, but they do have to know each other, and they should be basically allies. They might become enemies in play, but they shouldn\u2019t start out enemies."  And part of that is that you need the context and the backstory to have developed by the time they actually become enemies.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302364/#Comment_302364" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T14:37:45+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  2:37PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answers, everybody.<br/><br/>I feel like I have a good handle on it now.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302368/#Comment_302368" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T15:28:21+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  3:28PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2010 3:28PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I do sometimes:<br/><br/>One PC goes to murder the other.

PCs take Harm differently than NPCs. And this could rob the target PC from ever responding. But I would rule that if you take definitive hold of another PC, you can Go Aggro on them while restraining them instead of rolling Seize by Force again. <br/><br/>I have not seen a situation where it wasn't clear who acted first. If PC 1 says I run, and then PC 2 says I shoot him as he runs, PC 1 goes first. The only reason PC 2 is shooting PC 1 is because PC 1 is running, so obviously running happened first. The opposite is true. If 1 PC says they shoot and the other says they run to avoid being shot, the person shooting goes first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302445/#Comment_302445" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T16:11:13+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  4:11PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2010 4:12PM by cwilbur.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>You mentioned that the specifics of the story, and the history between the characters, would inform your decision.<br/><br/>So, as MC, given this situation, and the two players shouting out pretty much simultaneously:<br/>- "I run for it!"<br/>- "I shoot him!"<br/><br/>...what factors would you want to know?

What exactly Character B is doing is dependent on context. You know what is going on because you made the example up (or saw it at your table), but when we have "Character A runs for the door, Character B shoots at him," that can generate a whole bunch of different scenarios depending on what sort of context those two actions are given.<br/><br/>In general: whoever talks first should go first. If it's NOT a move, it just happens, let other players react to it, or let the same player continue talking. If it IS a move, maybe be a bit more strict about letting other players react, but don't be super-strict about the round-robin turn-taking. If you're in a battle, make sure everybody gets a turn each tick.<br/><br/>Shooting a guy, for a PC, is nearly always a move in the final text. I think the examples make it pretty clear that only if somebody is completely helpless do you just dish out the harm with no roll. If it's an NPC shooting at the PC, do the Acting Under Fire roll for sure, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302498/#Comment_302498" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-28T13:50:44+00:00" title="November 28, 2010  1:50PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing to potentially consider: which character is the scene currently "about."  If this is something that Character A started, that they got the group into, that they've been building towards for a while, then you sure as hell better let Player A roll for Character A, right?<br/><br/>That said, I agree with Mike, trying to resolve hypothetical problems before they happen seems ridiculous.  If it happens in play, then you can start worrying about it.

But even then. As one of my players has said, AW offers advantage to preemptive striking. It's better to go aggro NOW than wait for the other guy to do it. So when the game does go PvP, it's always clear who goes first. The only situation where that might not be true is some kinda formal duel. In which case I would just say simultaneous Seizing and they both go through the meat grinder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
