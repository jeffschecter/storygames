I could explain why, but I'll save it for another time.  <br/><br/>Here's my question.  In the two games that I've played, and in many of the APs I've read by others, I've notice that the stories created using PDP have drifted from pulp into camp.  I like pulp stories; campy stories and humor, not so much.  <br/><br/>I'm wondering this: is there anything that you can see inherent in the game system that predisposes play towards this campy tone?  Or is it something to do with the "elevator pitch", the players' expectations about the game, session, or genre being emulated; or is it the color text, or something else entirely?  Is my play experience different from others?  Are other people's games more dramatic and less campy?<br/><br/>Could an epic high fantasy playset for PDP, like Middle-Earth, work?<br/>Could a playset emulating the setting of the Matrix work with PDP?<br/>Is every King Arthur playset going to get turn towards Monty Python and the Holy Grail?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448180/#Comment_448180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-23T08:04:00+00:00" title="August 23, 2015  8:04AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who were you playing with? I ask because there is a marked tendency along folks new to games with great narrative freedom to take it "too far"(i.e. into camp), which is (I think) a response to feeling liberated in terms of authorial input/control. I ask because PDP is one common game used to introduce people to gaming, so can be prone to this. <br/><br/>(Also, many people aren't actually familiar with the tropes of golden age pulp, so might draw on camp themes inadvertently...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448264/#Comment_448264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-28T15:39:37+00:00" title="August 28, 2015  3:39PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost all the players were new to RPG/story-games.
