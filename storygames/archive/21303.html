I have infinite more respect for the time and effort designers put into balancing and tweaking rules to make games fun.  Here's a post-mortem of the first playtest of a game I'm working on as an object lesson to other inexperienced designers out there.<br/><br/>For some context, a game is about people on a journey. I'd imagined it to be a quiet, introspective, perhaps intensely personal, tone-poem of a game, where people talk about insecurities, traumas, and how travel brings them new perspective to view their past and make decisions about their future.<br/><br/>What I got was a madcap romp with kidnappings, wagon chases, and betrayals - I was aiming for Penny for My Thoughts and got something closer to Fiasco instead.<br/><br/>Without getting into too much detail about the mechanics, here are some takeaways I had from the session. I know most of this is old hat for veterens, but maybe they'll help novices like my past self:\n<ul> <li>Set the tone from the beginning - Instead of setting the players' expectations about the types of story they'd be telling, I left the rules too flexible, hoping that they could apply to any sort of journey. We very quickly ran into problems due to lack of the appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts.  This wasn't GURPS by any means.</li>\n<li>Sometimes a mechanic sounds great in theory and is terrible in execution -there were two examples of this, one a 'mood' mechanic that basically always caused a downward spiral into bad moods and antagonism and didn't have any way of fixing it.  If you build something to hamper your characters, you need some mechanism to ameliorate it.  The other was the Wild Card, which gets its own bullet below </li>\n<li>Chaos is not always a good thing - I wanted to introduce the possibility of narrative uncertainty into my game, so I allowed for a literal Wild Card.  Whenever a player drew a joker, they could do some rule-breaking stuff, both mechanically and narratively.  This allowed for a pretty big latitude for the story to shift but I forgot two things: 1) New players have a habit of going gonzo when they don't know what to do and 2) Reshuffling a limited deck means that the Wild Card will appear again. Quickly.  Things spiraled into chaos and madness very soon and without good conflict resolution mechanics, things got confusing fast.</li>\n<li>Sometimes it's okay to play Calvinball to have fun, but don't expect to be playing a coherent game at the end - When we ran into flawed mechanics, the group would suggest workarounds that would make the game more fun. These were great for the playtest, but most ended up on the cutting room floor at the end of the day.  They were great workarounds, and may one day be worked into another game idea, but were bad for the original concept.  A patch is never going to be as strong as something that was woven in from the start.</li>\n<li> Whenever you estimate the max number of players, always try it first with something far lower if you want to have a proof-of-concept. Go for the max if you want to see the problems immediately -  I had three players and myself. Since it was a GM-less game, I thought this would be okay, but it quickly became apparent that the mechanics weren't ready to support more than 2 players.  Scene framing, scene ending, conflict resolution, and even the reduced number of cards available in the 'draw' stack rapidly showed themselves to be problems.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466588/#Comment_466588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T20:30:01+00:00" title="September 26, 2017  8:30PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great self-reflection: I wish you all the best with future playtests of this design and everything you come up with in the future. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466593/#Comment_466593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T22:16:00+00:00" title="September 26, 2017 10:16PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that building rule-breaking into the rules isn't a good idea, been there too. Despite all the problems I'd recommend you to not ditch your design yet. I made a post-mortem of a design of mine too a few years ago, and find out years later that the system actually worked for the players, but what ruined it for them was the setting implications. There are probably more things then you'd believe there to save and recycle. Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466596/#Comment_466596" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T05:45:27+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  5:45AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for putting this up here for everyone!  <br/>I hope you will stay with it and continue to develop your ideas!<br/>Davey                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466597/#Comment_466597" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T06:28:42+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  6:28AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting is always educational even if it goes off the rails.
