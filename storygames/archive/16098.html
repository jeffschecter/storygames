No, I don't want to go back to counting bullets. But stats like "Willing" and "Positive condition: Supported" are so abstract they hardly evoke any imagery. Here are some questions that came into my mind:<br/><br/>-In the games you play, can you trace the fiction back to mechanics ("Jo shooting Jim clearly means that Jo's player used her Condition: armed")?<br/>-If not, does it imply you're creating the fiction without much help from the system, mechanics and fiction each staying in their own realm? <br/>-Do easily reskinnable mechanics mean there was not that much flavor in them in the first place? <br/>-In the games you play, do you ever have things happening in fiction that you absolutely didn't want or couldn't foresee happening, as in, you can't just always interpret the mechanics so that you get something you wanted in the first place?  <br/>-If some mechanical element doesn't come up in the game fiction at all, can it still be relevant in some way? <br/><br/>I guess they could be split to different threads, but I think they all revolve around the same theme.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366830/#Comment_366830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:14:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read about Clouds and Boxes?

I don't find conditions like that very "abstract." Something like "condition: armed" is very specific. The fact that it could mean a gun, a sword, or a chair just makes it flexible to the fiction.<br/><br/>When random results come up that are too specific, sometimes it works and sometimes it feels random and forced.<br/><br/><b>Do easily reskinnable mechanics mean there was not that much flavor in them in the first place?</b><br/><br/>Depends on what is being reskinned and what is left untouched. I've only heard of one instance of people playing Smallville in the written setting, and yet it's going to drive relationship drama regardless of the reskinning. You can play anything you want with Primetime Adventures, as long as its a TV Show. FATE on the other hand does handle action genres well, but it also does hard sci-fi and I imagine could work with a somber parlor setting (not very well, in my opinion, though). Easily reskinned mechanics can be a sign of lighter theme or genre controls in the mechanics, but I'd say more often it's a sign of the player(s) not having an attachment to whatever sort of flavor they're changing.  Like, I don't get why so many people enjoy HERO games for superheroes, but they're after a much different flavor of superheroes than I am in the first place.<br/><br/><b>In the games you play, do you ever have things happening in fiction that you absolutely didn't want or couldn't foresee happening, as in, you can't just always interpret the mechanics so that you get something you wanted in the first place?</b><br/><br/>Oh, sure. If I'm reading you correctly, that's the entire point of game mechanics for me (instead of just playing an improve game or storytelling with friends). The results are often surprising and unexpected. This can be simply die rolls, but the more memorable moments go beyond the mechanics.<br/><br/>There are always times where someone says or does something (usually dialog though) that wows everyone and changes the course of events. I was in a Dogs in the Vineyard game, where we were in the middle of a heated conflict, and every raise so far has been promising a no-holds-barred bloody fight. Then someone said something unexpected, but emotionally true to what was going on, and the other person immediately gave in. The conflict ended without bloodshed because allowing that moment to happen was better than trying to win by any other means.<br/><br/><b>If some mechanical element doesn't come up in the game fiction at all, can it still be relevant in some way?</b><br/><br/>If it comes up mechanically it's ALWAYS relevant.  I'm not sure what would come up mechanically that's ignored fictionally?  The only type of example that comes to mind are hit points (or stress in FATE) which has no real fiction impact. There's no penalties, no necessary injuries. It's more of an expression of how much "fight" a character has left. You can choose to describe sword blows, scratches, or near misses and wearing down, but you can also skip past it to make things move faster.  It's still relevant in the most important way (the game mechanics) even if not expressed in the fiction. Is that along the lines of what you were thinking?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366929/#Comment_366929" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T14:37:46+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  2:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>- In the games you play, can you trace the fiction back to mechanics ("Jo shooting Jim clearly means that Jo's player used her Condition: armed")?<br/>- If not, does it imply you're creating the fiction without much help from the system, mechanics and fiction each staying in their own realm?<br/>- Do easily reskinnable mechanics mean there was not that much flavor in them in the first place?<br/></blockquote>\nThese first two are things that clearly vary depending on what game I'm playing.  For example, almost all of the character traits in 1001 Nights actually have zero mechanical effect, while the fictional effects for the stories told are all just in the hands of the current storyteller.  On the other hand, in my Call of Cthulhu game, there is a pretty clear connection between the stats for the 12 gauge shotgun and the fictional effect of firing it.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>In the games you play, do you ever have things happening in fiction that you absolutely didn't want or couldn't foresee happening, as in, you can't just always interpret the mechanics so that you get something you wanted in the first place?</blockquote>\nSomething happening that I couldn't foresee is pretty rare.  The only cases I can think of are where I didn't know the rules for something and was surprised when I looked them up.  In most cases, though, I know what the options are that could come up as a result of the mechanics, so I can foresee any of those.  For the most part, I enjoy whatever comes up.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>If some mechanical element doesn't come up in the game fiction at all, can it still be relevant in some way?</blockquote>\nI think this is definitely the case, as long as the players know that they are there.  An example I typically use is this: <br/><br/>In a LARP (live-action role-playing) game, I place a prop gun on the table.  In explaining the rules, I say that in this game, anyone can pick up the gun - and if they fire it at someone, that player character is automatically dead.  Now we can go through playing the game and it may be that no one actually picks up the gun.  However, it could definitely make a difference to the experience of the players to know that the option of firing that gun is there.  For example, two characters might have a heated argument in the room, and one of them glances at the table but ultimately makes no move towards it.  The experience of the player is undoubtedly affected knowing that they could instantly kill the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366949/#Comment_366949" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T15:53:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>In the games you play, can you trace the fiction back to mechanics ("Jo shooting Jim clearly means that Jo's player used her Condition: armed")?</b><br/>\n"Her <i>excellent</i> strike easily evades your <i>poor</i> attempt at blocking.

Easily reskinnable mechanics can have orifices for putting flavour in and they can also not. Easily reskinnable mechanics often have a meta-flavour. This is evident, for example, in the resolution mechanic from Apocalypse World.<br/>\n<b>In the games you play, do you ever have things happening in fiction that you absolutely didn't want or couldn't foresee happening, as in, you can't just always interpret the mechanics so that you get something you wanted in the first place?</b><br/>\nAll the time. Getting shot sucks. Having to shoot players sucks too because usually they're at high risk of death.<br/>\n<b>If some mechanical element doesn't come up in the game fiction at all, can it still be relevant in some way?</b><br/>\nAll mechanics reflect in the fiction somewhere because they're part of the conditions of play. Whether the mechanic-fiction meshes well with the non-mechanic fiction is another question. Ideally, both can be dealt with in one motion. Is a piece of mechanic-fiction that is not relevant to the non-mechanic fiction relevant to the overall fiction? It really depends on the goals of the game in question. If a game consists of two distinct and unconnected subgames then it certainly will feel dissonant. I won't say that that's bad by definition though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366962/#Comment_366962" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T17:02:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  5:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 5:03PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upstart, your post rings to me of <i>activation conditions</i>.

If there is much leeway in translating fiction to rules and much leeway in translating rules to fiction, I think the rules don't really have a lot of connection with what happens.

In visual media, if somebody's intent is relevant, it's good storytelling to <i>show it</i>. I don't want a clumsy VO explaining what this guy's motivation really was. I want it to be evident from the actual events, even if it's someone just crying in silence or staring at an empty chair. Now, in many games, the motivations, goals and intents are represented in the rules in a quite exact manner, while there's a lot of room for interpreting what happens in the fiction. But for me it'd be compelling if the fiction was quite exact but there was a lot of room for interpreting the meaning of actions. Maybe it'd feel forced and unnatural, I don't know. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>This definitely can be an issue in some indie games (and other games), without a doubt.

Some people feel that certain types of mechanics are very "immersive" or tightly wound to the fiction, and others disagree completely.<br/><br/>For instance, some people would consider d20-style task resolution to be very "tight" in this sense:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>nowhere<i>near</i>as tight as, for example, skills in d20</blockquote>\nAnd some others criticize d20 for precisely this problem: some guy rolls his Diplomacy skill and now the NPC is supposed to be Friendly, but we don't really know why.<br/><br/>Especially interesting studies, I think, are rules-light resolution games, like The Pool and Ghost/Echo. Are those mechanics "tighter" in terms of rules-fiction connection, or looser?<br/><br/>Edit: Joe McDaldno's "Gun Thief" is also a good example, as is JWalt's <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2010/05/01/ghost-opera-mechanics-in-brief/" rel="nofollow">Ghost Opera/Nine Suns</a>. Neither involves any dice at all, but both are pretty heavily fixated on the fiction that's happening at any given moment.<br/><br/>A lot of people tote Apocalypse World as one of the best "tight" designs in this sense, but many disagree with that too.<br/><br/>I think it depends a lot on the techniques you and your group use to play in a certain style, and how the mechanics of a particular game interface (or fail to interface) with your preferred techniques. (It also depends a great deal on what's "familiar" and comfortable and what isn't to a certain gamer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367656/#Comment_367656" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T15:10:40+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  3:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>I want the mechanics to produce a certain kind of story even if the players are going to hate it.</blockquote>I think combining that with tight fiction-mechanics translation is a genuinely difficult spec!<br/><br/>I like it, though.  I'll see if I can come up with anything...<br/><br/>The most "produce a certain kind of story" games I can think of don't even <i>have</i> mechanics that enter the flow of roleplay.  Grey Ranks, Fiasco, and Montsegur 1244 all basically take turns between "now we're establishing some key content or criteria for the fiction" and "now we're doing stuff in character".<br/><br/>Perhaps the solution is just to build the right situations: the right combo of starting scenarios, character objectives, and rules for what happens when the PCs aren't making stuff happen.  This is a large part of how Dogs produces the kinds of stories it does.  Within such a structure, you <i>could</i> introduce just about any type of fictional causality-modeling mechanics.  A problem with "any old mechanic" is that it might not <i>contribute</i> to the story.  But hey, maybe just an agreed-upon way to move forward is sufficient in the right fictional situation.<br/><br/>It's worth noting, though, how Dogs' mechanics do contribute to the story, basically by saying, "You can't get the <i>ends</i> you want (set things right) without resorting to <i>means</i> that might sully that (violence)."  Of course, other modeling systems could produce that too.  But one that didn't would produce very different stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367657/#Comment_367657" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T15:12:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  3:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 3:19PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>some guy rolls his Diplomacy skill and now the NPC is supposed to be Friendly, but we don't really know why.</blockquote>I think that particular skill is the worst culprit of the bunch, but yeah, good point.

Most skill names give you some sense of what might have happened in the fiction during the roll (in this case, presumably some kind of climbing action).<br/><br/>Still, it's a matter of taste and application.<br/><br/>For instance, it's very easy to play out a character searching for and disarming traps, negotiating to buy something, doing some research, etc, without having much sense at all of what actually happened and how. ("Ok, you find a trap in the room. Roll to disarm it. Good, it's safe to go through now.")<br/><br/>Repeated skill tests are probably the worst offender (like d20 combat). We're potentially rolling and rolling, and subtracting hit points (or not, maybe it's all whiffs) or just asking for a reroll because we're waiting for a failure so we can bring in the next planned scene, and there's really NO sense at all of what's happening in the fiction in any concrete sense. We know that there's a dragon and a warrior and they're both fighting each other (and the term "attack" suggest they're trying to stab each other or something similar), but beyond that it can be hard to say. (The usual D&amp;D conundrum, for instance, is when you roll to hit, based on the opponent's armour class, and roll a hit--does that mean you avoided the armour, or what? But then you subtract some hit points, which could stand for "luck" or "fighter's reflexes, and ability to get out of the way"... so now, did you actually hit your opponent or not?)<br/><br/>Is it arguable, perhaps, that the character who uses "I've got a voice like a nightingale, 2d8" to seduce the village Steward is operating at a similar level of abstraction?

In the former, we can fail to know how you got there; in the latter, we can't.<br/><br/>If you resolve the task, and then figure out where that resolution gets you in the fiction, that's different from simply resolving where you get in the fiction.  <i>Technically</i>, we could say it's just a difference in scale -- climbing doesn't tell us whether you're primairly using your fingers or your toes, for instance -- but <i>practically</i>, I think that scale difference maps to important differences at the table:<br/><br/>1) Details we care about ("how did the steward go from hostile to seduced?") vs details we don't care about ("fingers or toes?").<br/><br/>2) Details we can assume, intuit, or otherwise easily imagine ("fingers!") vs those we can't ("uh, the steward was hostile... and then... you sang like a nightingale... and he heard it... and... uh... then what?").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367778/#Comment_367778" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T00:38:28+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 12:38AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>I want the mechanics to produce a certain kind of story even if the players are going to hate it.</blockquote>I think combining that with tight fiction-mechanics translation is a genuinely difficult spec!<br/><br/>I never thought them as separate things.

The characters go on missions, shoot aliens with actual guns with stats, roll for exactly how many aliens they killed. The rules simply won't let you make it a game about anything else than soldiers competing for gear and promotions. You can't just twist the rules until you get the fictional result you want. If you want to kill anything, there are clear rules for what to roll.<br/><br/>Now, let's look at Shock's Praxis, or whatever its name was. IIRC, you can choose very broad stats and choose about any intent you want in a conflict and roll about any stat you want. The core of the conflict mechanic is almost meaningless, you could practically replace it with both players rolling a d6 and the winner telling what happens and the fiction wouldn't change. <br/><br/>I don't want to <i>decide</i> what happens, even collaboratively. I want to <i>find out</i> what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367918/#Comment_367918" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T14:02:26+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  2:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2012 2:03PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha, cool.

It's true that 3:16 has sharp focus, and I appreciate that. But my point was that it has outcomes that are "non-negotiable". You can't use a stat creatively to make your weapon better: there are very rigid conditions for that. It may be that sharp focus makes tight connection easier, but you can certainly have a very focused game that nevertheless has rules that don't really guide the fiction.<br/><br/>I prefer a stat like "killing stuff" to a stat like "aim". The Fighting Ability/Non-fighting Ability -split in 3:16 was quite serviceable. The important thing is that the limits are clear, so you can't use FA for constructing a tent or convincing a superior. "Killing stuff" is about what happens, not just about the motivation, so I like it. <br/><br/>As for climbing, it really depends on what kind of game it is. But if climbing is supposed to be some sort of big deal, I want the system to make sure that the player can't just decide his guy will succeed in climbing and then tap all sorts of tangential motivations and intents to ensure that this happens, without any of those motivations really impacting fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
