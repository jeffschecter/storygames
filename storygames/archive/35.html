                    Imagine a game based on the 1972 Munich Olympic village hostage-taking.  <br/><br/>This game is structured so you play it three consecutive times - as the PFLP hostage-takers, as the hostages themselves, and as the Germans and Israelis trying to free the hostages.  <br/><br/>You know how the game begins, how it progresses, and how it ends in great detail.  You know who dies, and when.  What you don't know is how these groups interacted among themselves and with each other.  <br/><br/>First of all, given a *single* constrained, linear narrative, I'm absolutely convinced that you can craft a compelling RPG experience.  But what about intersecting narratives?  How would you address events morphing from one "version" to the next?  Would this lead to unsatisfying play?  Any thoughts on how to structure overlapping play like this?                </div>

                            Well, one option is to accept changing events in each timeline as the default - not to toot my own horn, but thats what I was going for with Timestream. So, like, assuming time travel/multiple universes as the backdrop, I don't think it would be a problem at all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still thinking about flashback narratives, so thats the other place my mind is going - each telling of events is structured as a history, with the understanding that each is subjective to whatever group is telling the story.<br/>
<br/>
Or, there's some kind of stakes to having "your" story be the "real" one, so there's competition between each group to have theirs make the most sense/be the most coherent/be the most accepted. Something like someone is going to go down over the event - will it be the criminals that were caught, the police that allowed it to happen, or the DAs office that failed to prosecute? Things like "Who's at fault" and "who will be punished" would be the story stakes, and each group involved is trying to craft the most advantageous story.                        </div>

                            What interests me is the idea of exploring the same even from three wildly different viewpoints, so I guess Roshomon would be a more accurate touchstone.  <br/><br/>I also really like the idea of having, in essence, a script:  "In act II, some PFLP guy shoots this hostage in the head."  Maybe there is room for ambiguity, but maybe it is completely spelled out and the game is a psychodrama with all the meaningful action taking place internally, with the external world on rails.  <br/><br/>My main question is about retelling the same story from three points of view, and how to make that both interesting and workable.                        </div>

                            I'd implement it by setting up first the scope of time covered and a few benchmarks of what will happen in that time.  Something like "The events take up a week of game-time.  On Day One, the PFLP guys plan and the athletes attend the Opening Ceremony.  On Day Two, the kidnapping occurs.  On Day Three, Joe shoots Jim in the head.  On Day Four, the negotiator is allowed inside.  On Day Five, there's a shoot-out.  Blah blah blah, I display more ignorance about what actually happened."<br/><br/>Hell, you can even have the scene framing mechanics work off of those benchmarks.  There's a little game out there, you might have heard of it, called the Roach, which just dictates to the players which scenes they're going to play.  You should check it out sometime!<br/><br/>In any case, if the players know such things like who dies when and who survives to the end, and accept those as unalterable events, they can then play around them through the course of the game.  Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Thanks, it really does.  I'll have to check out that Roach thing, I hear it is utterly fantastic.  <br/><br/>Here's the deal - imagine playing the Roach three times in a row, from three POVs, with each session having equal weight in terms of causality.  Besides it being a spectacular goat-screw, you'd need to constrain events and actions pretty harshly to make it work, and that's what I want to explore.  I'm also interested in what experiences emerge when you just take away *situation* as a variable, period.  <br/><br/>Maybe I just need to write the game to explain what I'm trying to do!                        </div>

                            Or how.  Or what it means to the characters.  Plotting free-form is like that. It may sound like you take away the surprise, but the path to getting where you think you're going is always not what you expect.                        </div>

                            What Josh and Emily said.<br/><br/>I learned that this totally works with the Roach and I'm hooked, and I want to push this until the idea breaks.  Grey Ranks takes it farther (twelve scenes that take place on exact dates in 1944) but it can totally go farther.                        </div>

                            Also, I have an older game concept on the Forge called "Humble Mythologies" which I co-brainstormed with Eero Tuovinen.  The idea was for you to symbolically "through-frame" every scene before you played it, so you had a vision or guideline of what was going to happen, but the pleasure was in seeing how the little details unfolded or which previously unspecified characters would become real people ("Hostage #13" is much more interesting as "Jason Morningstar").  Same general idea, though not from the multiple angles perspective you mean here.                        </div>

                            Sounds good, Jonathan!  <br/><br/>In a didactic way I can see a game like this as being useful as an empathy exercise - find a conflict that is polarized and play it out from several perspectives.  Play the Dogs, then play the town, then play the cult, all bound to the same narrative.  Actually, that might be interesting - maybe the first play-through defines the boundaries of the conflict and its resolution, and the other two riff off that internally.  After playing as Dogs, you know Brother Levi gets hung and the cult is disbanded, but when you play as the town, you get to see what that <em>means</em> to the town.  "Three times" is also sorta arbitrary - it'd work doing it twice.                        </div>

                            So, if you imagine two facts on each day serving as boundaries and definitions, you could start playing from a point of view, and frame say two more scenes each day. The beginning and ending of these scenes would be defined by what Fact they touch. Run through it again and squeeze into the middle. Run through it again and follow the same pattern. If a | is a fact, and numbers correspond to scenes as their played out, you would have (for a three day version of the game):<br/>
<br/>
Day  One:<br/>
| 1 7 13 14 8 2 | <br/>
Day Two:<br/>
| 3 9 15 16 10 4 |<br/>
Day Three:<br/>
| 5 11 17 18 12 6 |                        </div>

                            Scene 7 would be limited by whatever was established at the end of Scene 1, and would define the start of Scene 13.<br/>
<br/>
Is this what you're looking for? Even plausible?                        </div>

                            Jason, I'd hazard that "three times" is the least number of times to really develop something organic.  Doing it twice just gets you he said/she said.  Three times gets you perspective <em>on</em> the he said/she said.  Four times gives you perspective that qualifies the original, et cetera.                        </div>

                            You could go through each scene from the different points of view before moving on. Then you only have to worry about "fitting" into one scene at a time. Rotate which faction gets the first pass-through in order to equalize out who gets to set the initial restrictions, and there ya go.                        </div>

                            You may be right about three being a charm - that's what called out to me, so on some level I must have realized that.  It limits the possible situations in which this sort of game would kick, but in a good way.<br/><br/>And doing it scene by scene makes much more sense, actually - lots of details and cues could get lost over a long game.  <br/><br/>Mark, I'm not sure I follow you.                        </div>

                            Greg Stolze had this neat idea in response to someone's concept for a UA Planetary game where the game took place with the core investigative characters and the GM prepared a one-shot with pre-made characters so the players played out a one-shot about what they were investigating.<br/>
<br/>
Sounded kinda neat, playing through the secret history just under the world.                        </div>

                            Hmm, okay. What I was trying to say is that if you have a defining fact at the beginning and end of each chunk of time, you have a definition for what follows before and what follows after. So, on Day 1, we start with a scene at the beginning of the drama. The game itself has defined the beginning fact, the | symbol:<br/>
<br/>
| 1<br/>
<br/>
Thus, as we play through a couple of scenes, we're only bound by what preceeded 1. Then we play scene 2:<br/>
<br/>
| 1 ?? ?? ?? ?? 2 |<br/>
<br/>
We have a rough idea of what preceeded 2 because we know how we ended 1 and that there's something that will end 2, the |, because it is predefined by the game. Using my original map of gameplay, we'd come back to day one when we started playing scene 7:<br/>
<br/>
| 1 7 ?? ?? ?? 2 |<br/>
<br/>
We'd know what defines the beginning of scene 7 because of what ended scene 1. We'd know that we couldn't override what happened at the beginning of scene 2. Otherwise, those would be our only barriers. I was trying to suggest a way of playing through a couple of scenes at a time for each day, and then starting over to run through someone else's perspective, without overriding anything done and allowing for new facts to come to light. You could do it inversely as well:<br/>
<br/>
| { 13 [ 7 &lt; 1 2 &gt; 8 ] 14 } |<br/>
<br/>
That is, you could do two scenes that butt up against each other &lt; &gt;, then on the second try at that day, do scenes that wrap around that [ ], and then again on the third time through { }.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug* Just a thought I had while reading. It may not work logistically or practically.                        </div>
