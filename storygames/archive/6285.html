(I generally don't appreciate gns-gamist games)<br/>\nHowever, what I really like is participating in the fiction elaboration, be it centered on characters, stories or setting. I learned to accept the other frustrations, but I am still growing weary of the traditional GM/player divide. When I GM (as I'll do this Sunday), I regret that I am the only one that really adds things to the fiction. The players mostly did their active parts with character creations (fascinating backgrounds and all), but in game they are mostly reacting. And when I am a player, I am frustrated by the (traditional, unthought) GM's protectionism, I am restricted to playing my character. My gaming group games drifted to allow for more story-oriented games, but we are still very far from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I see hope. I see that I can participate more as a player. And I also see hope for many other frustrations that I learned to swallow, the most blatant being stories not happening because of "realism", over-commitment to actor-stance \u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, this is what I see now, from my still very foggy point of view. I have no ideas what I still have to discover that might please me mightily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and, yes, please, if you recommend a game, do tell why. What are these games strength and weaknesses? Please speak of your own game(s), but then tell who you are relative to the game (author, trusted playtester, editor\u2026), it\u2019s only fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, many thanks in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139241/#Comment_139241" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T08:10:33+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  8:10AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Primetime Adventures is a great game for retaining a GM yet spurring the participation thing.

The choice should be driven by enthusiasm, not frustration.<br/><br/>Talking about GM-less games, I think people here, used to years of games where they give adversity to each other, sell very short the learning curve needed to master (as in "learn", not "GM") them.  Both Polaris and Shock could fall very "flat" if the people at the table don't understand (or are not used and forgot to do it during the game) to "hit" each other in the right way. Before trying games like these, where the players have to do all the work of giving adversity to each other, I would advice some kind of game where there is both GM-given adversity and inter-character conflict, like for example In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>As an aside, Ajax, not as "the" next game you will play with your usual group (it depends of the answer to Paul's question, and on what you and your friends like), but as a very, very good text that explain a lot of this "dirty hippy way of playing" in a language understandable by long-time gamers, my advice is to read Dogs in the Vineyard.   Read it, lend your copy to other people to read, then play it with the people who did get excited reading it. Play it as an aside, in a different day, to avoid forcing it to people who would be not so excited (if you are not so lucky that all the group is excited by the book, I mean. In that case go play it, you have found the game to play) and avoid making the rest of the group "menaced" by this new game. Play it like a experiment with like-minded people.  It doesn't teach all the techniques used in these games, but it's the best teaching text for many of them, and, most of all, for a "way of playing" very different from the one most gamers are used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh" title="Gorsh"><img alt="Gorsh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh">Gorsh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139271/#Comment_139271" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T09:27:13+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  9:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 9:29AM by Gorsh.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite><br/>I think I learned to live with the frustrations generated by the weakness of gns-simulation-oriented play.

A few subtypes of "S" games fall apart when players don\xb4t push their agendas forward, for one thing ( John Kim has an article on this ); and for the other, Stances are just techniques that can, at least theoretically, work for any agenda... <br/>I say this because nothing in your post talks specifically about a change in creative-agenda-focus-of-games: the problems you had MAY be signs of your need to change CA... or just signs of the CA you like, but done wrong ( again, "wrong" meaning "wrong for you" ).<br/><br/>Or maybe you DO want the N side of life.

If you want to get involved in playing these games but aren't in proximitiy to hepcat gamers, we have a small enclave that has formed at fouruglymonsters.com. We use VTs (virtual tabletops) and either Ventrilo or Skype. I'm currently in a game of My Life with Master which kicks ass.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought that living in a small college town in Alabama would mean I was doomed to learn how to play M:tG. In fact, it turns out that an old-timer in this very community lives in the very same small college town. I'm now hanging with him and his group.<br/><br/>I had a very good first experience with PtA, but it was with an experienced GM. Likewise with InSpectres.<br/><br/>I'd suggest starting to encorporate narrative techniques into your gamist games. First of all, if you're in a d20 group, think about porting to True20.<br/><br/>A technique I use is to have each player roll a d12, the winner being awarded the right to frame the next scene. The narrating player then has to roll a d10 the next time...and so on.<br/><br/>Also, think about bringing Fan Mail (from Primetime Adventures) and Keys (from The Shadow of Yesterday) into your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139503/#Comment_139503" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T10:43:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2008 10:43AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ehm...  people, maybe it's better to wait for Ajax's answer to the first post? <br/><br/>I mean... we don't want to play a variant of "waiting for Ben Lehman" here, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139524/#Comment_139524" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T14:27:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  2:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>What should I go, where should I do?</blockquote>\nGo to the web sites of all those games you mentioned.

You have the GM even though I and someothers here had good experience of playing it GMless. Still the play is driven by the players as in his/her turn the player requests a scene defining its place, overall goal and focus. Other PCs can still participate in other PCs scenes. The party stops being a clump of numbers with tach PC gaining individuality and believability through exploration of the "issues". The resolution system is conflict based, very intuitive as well as effective. It is based on TV shows but in reality it works with whatever setting you can imagine, including D&amp;D-like Fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139555/#Comment_139555" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T02:27:17+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  2:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2008 2:27AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Y\u2019all</b>, thanks for your answers and excuse me for my silence. Family duties kept me away from the internet more than I anticipated.<br/><br/><b>Paul C.</b>, it\u2019s difficult to focus on only one memorable play experience\u2026 There are so many to choose from. That\u2019s a good new in itself. [I fear my last post has made me seem too bitter.] It\u2019s difficult to choose one that would be relevant to choosing a story game. And it\u2019s very difficult to summarize one. Summarized, they get really lame [or maybe it is I that can\u2019t condense them correctly], and they\u2019re really too long in their full length.  [Also, I know how boring and uninteresting other players\u2019 memories can be.] However, I\u2019ll try.<br/><br/>First, a bit of context. There is this <i>really</i> powerful mage (gm\u2019s character), that had tried to reduce my character in a kind of magical slavery, and failed. Since, they\u2019ve been enemies. PowerfulMage isn\u2019t evil, isn\u2019t a villain, but neither is he good. He has is own goals.  PowerfulMage is too strong for my character to defeat and they both know it. They have some common enemies. PowerfulMage is also very attached to being discreet and staying incognito (he really like magical disguises and amnesia spells) and has enough hold over my character to ensure he doesn\u2019t \u201cbetray\u201d him. This goes on for a long time. New players join the gaming group, their characters integrate the setting.<br/><br/>Now, it happened to pass that another player got her character in a situation that neutralized her for a long time, so she started creating a new one to play meanwhile. She chooses a name, and a description, and a profession that matched my character\u2019s sister\u2019s, so we decide her new character is indeed my character\u2019s sister. Soon after, my character is caught in a side plot that also makes him go his own way for a time. In the intervening time, Sister meets PowerfulMage (neither the player nor the character know who this is) at a party, and she falls for him (player decision), and him for her. Some months go by. My character came back. He is very happy for his sister but does not meet her suitor immediately. <br/><br/>(Here start the session that contains the singular enjoyable memory.) Sister throws a biig birthday party in their new magnificent house, with many friends. It is very merry. My character is late, he has so many duties, but finally manages to come mid-party. He is so glad to have an evening to relax. There are so many friends here. What a magnificent celebration! And then, his beloved sister introduces him to her fianc\xe9\u2026 Surprised, incredulous, they recognize each other. A glacial conversation ensues. Nobody understands what is happening. The ambiance is crashing. Sister flees in tears, PowerfulMage and my character both try to pursue and appease her, in vain. That was a hell of a session. Good roleplay all around. Climax of a looong tension. The relationships between Sister, PowerfulMage and my character were forever changed in ways nobody had predicted.<br/><br/>I hope you can do something with this memory. Please do tell if you need more details or another kind of experience.<br/><br/><br/><b>Robert</b>, PTA and Polaris did catch my eye, as they keep recurring in conversation. What would you say are the main differences between Shock and Polaris?<br/><br/><b>Paul C.</b> (again), I understand your concerns. Not choosing from frustrations, yes. I have the hope that SG can give me play experiences I\u2019ll enjoy more. It is unavoidably grounded in frustrations generated by my current play styles. And I am indeed conscious about the peril of trusting other players\u2019 enthusiasm or seductive theories. I\u2019ll try not to fall into theses traps. But I have choices to make and it seemed to me the best thing to do was to ask more experienced player. I didn\u2019t know that single-memorable-play-experience thing; I am curious as how it will unfold.<br/><br/><b>Graham</b>: of course I\u2019ll pester you for more information.

On the whole I am interested in experiencing new (for me) ways to play. But I have to start somewhere. So maybe totally GMless games are a too long step now. I think you maybe right. I talked to my gaming group yesterday about story games and I did not make a good job of it. They did not seem interested and I had some defensive reactions <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> coming from the players I would have thought the most open. I\u2019ll try anyway. Maybe with some other friends.<br/><br/>Dogs is on the top of my list, as it is very often listed. The mechanics in themselves very much drew my attention, but the setting concept repulses me. And I believe it is too soon to apply the toolbox approach I always favored with trad games. I came to think I have to enjoy a whole, true story-game experience before.<br/><br/>A problem I\u2019ll have is teaching the game. Yes, teaching. It is the play tradition with my friends that only the GM reads the game. (Blackbox simulationism, yeah!) So trying to make them read the book would be a deterrent. In any way, only one of my regular gaming friends reads English with enough proficiency to read rules, enjoy it, and play from it in a reasonable time.<br/><br/><b>Gorsh</b>, I indeed plan to import the techniques and attitude I find interesting into my regular, more trad, gamind session. But I want to experience pure story-games first, to know exactly what this is about. Then I\u2019ll decide if I want to play story-games or trad-games and what I\u2019ll import from into the other.

There are other interesting bits, but it is the system that really grabs me.<br/><br/>Shock is fantastic because it draws you into compelling and emotive situation so easily, and can tackle issues which I would shy away from in most games, and which you really care about. Playing Shock I was catapulted so quickly into dilemmas and moral confrontations that I hardly had time to breathe, and the game created a very high level of passion and engagement. It doesn't push all my buttons, because I would struggle with long-term play, but it is very good at what it does.<br/><br/>Burning Empires did the opposite, and really did not push my buttons. There seemed to be so many rules and sub systems, all with their own complexities and nuances, that I was at sea trying to play without a detailed reading of the rules.  Worse the rules that did get applied seemed horribly abstract and limiting in a way that the rules of Shock, which do not pretend realism, did not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139565/#Comment_139565" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T06:06:44+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  6:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite><b>Robert</b>, PTA and Polaris did catch my eye, as they keep recurring in conversation.

I wish I could recommend a game that has mechanics for other players spontaneously creating and playing NPCs as foils and antagonists for each other. Because I get the sense that you really liked the way the other player created your character's sister as a foil to your character. Theatrix does has rules for this, and so does Universalis. But I think those games are wrong for you for other reasons. So my recommendation is Nine Worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's designed for campaign play. The situation is morally grey. Relationships are its "fruitful void" (that is, the attribute locking and trait mechanics create relationship drama as a byproduct of players and the GM using them on each other in play). And inter-player relationship drama is as much a part of the game as player-to-NPC relationship drama.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139612/#Comment_139612" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T11:17:36+00:00" title="April 14, 2008 11:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a podcast out there somewhere that has a recording of Shock: being played.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>for its mechanics and its reputation.

(This isn\u2019t easy.) My English is probably good enough, given that I can stop and rewind whenever I need to (that is not the case when speaking with somebody, repeating oneself gets quickly tiresome and troubles the flow of conversation). Thank you none the less.<br><br><b>Paul C.</b> Wow. I am very impressed by your accurate analysis. Really. I must learn to do that. (At least to know and explain myself clearly.) I\u2019ll make some comments :\n<blockquote><ul><li>The opportunity to inhabit your character over multiple sessions</li></ul></blockquote>This is very important for me. I like to experience the setting in itself, the setting through the character and the character himself. The first thing I thought about when searching for a play experience to share was when characters take a life of their own. But it was too difficult to reduce to a singular event or session and I felt it was too specific.<br><br>Multiple sessions are important because they allow for a great depth and richness. And you need room to play plots/stories as complex as I like them.<br>\n<blockquote><ul><li>Morally grey, rather than morally black and white situations</li></ul></blockquote>Undoublty. Black and white is only good to be mixed into unrecognizable grey goo.\n<blockquote><ul><li>Other players creating and playing characters as foils to your own character</li></ul></blockquote>Not exactly. I like characters to have relationships that generate play. Sometimes (in their played life) they\u2019ll have opposing interests, but are more generally cooperating. Whether they enjoy cooperating is another question. They can have wildly different perceptions or appreciations of the same situations. Outright opposition isn\u2019t necessary. Now, these are my tastes in a trad, GM as opposition, game.\n<blockquote><ul><li>Relationship drama</li></ul></blockquote>Right. But not only. (<i>Babylon 5</i> (the series, I never tried the game) is an example of a good mix between relationships and \u201cthe rest\u201d. <i>The Accursed Kings</i> is also excellent.) But I do not <i>need</i> this. I played many other games without this aspect and quite enjoyed them.<br><br>Now, to your recommendation. I knew <i>Nine Worlds</i> existed, and I had read the <i>Indie Press Revolution</i>\u2019s blurb, but almost nothing else. I just read <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9632.phtml" rel="nofollow">Demetrius Morgan's review on rpg.net</a>. I am truly impressed by the match. More: <i>Nine worlds</i> seems to have quite a number of real similarities with my best homebrew (theme, cards, \u2026), if you abstract that mine was the blackest blackbox sim. I am left speechless. How do you do that?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">One more question, maybe a too abstract one: how broad a panorama of story-games possibilities would [will] <i>Nine Worlds</i> give me?</span>Edit: I rephrased this question two posts later.<br><br>Also, I <i>am</i> interested in changing my style of play, in trying other things or of going back to old ones. Morally grey is probably the only thing I would not like to change for any significant length of time. Short one-game session seem interesting to me.<br><br><b>Robert</b>, I just believe I would not enjoy playing this role.

However, it would be very difficult to do for me (not enough time, can't translate everything for my gaming group, it's difficult to pitch new games, \u2026). Also, I really enjoy reading games in itself. Sometimes I play alone. And, finally, the question stands on its merits alone.

From what I gather, Dogs behave in the worst religious-fanatic manner and rule the live and morality of other peoples. I would prefer to play people resisting these tyrants.</blockquote>Heh, I've been there, myself.<br/><br/>When I first read Dogs, I had a really bad reaction to it. I'm an agnostic with Atheist leanings and the first reading pushed my buttons in a bad way. But after that, I realized that I had completely missed the point of the game!<br/><br/>Dogs is not about playing fundamentalist Dogs "faithfully" (As in "True to the setting".) the way you're often pushed into playing Paladins in other games. In Dogs, the setting is just there as a setup for the PLAYERS to judge and make hard decisions. The biggest thing in Dogs are that the characters (and thus by extension the players) are the ones defining scripture. It's their power to say stuff like "That rule there? In the Book? Fuck it, it's a bad rule and it's changed as of now. So speaks the King of Life.". And chances are the people around the would disagree and then you have awesome conflict and the players making statements about how far they are willing to go to stand in for their convictions and making statements left and right. So play an atheist Dog, play a fundamentalist Dog, whatever, 's all cool. But the game is not <i>forcing</i> you to do that or even rewarding you for it. The setting in Dogs only matters insofar as that your characters are in position of power but also responsibility that puts them in hard places and makes them make hard decisions.<br/><br/>Now, you're not me, so maybe you have different reasons for not enjoying the setup. Put, personally, I'd still recommend Dogs. It's a great game and IMO a great introduction into many ideas you see in dirty hippy games. It's also a great text in itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140613/#Comment_140613" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T05:03:29+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  5:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2008 5:09AM by oliof.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ajax,<br/>\nit seems you're in the same time zone as Lord Minx and I.
