"EXCITING DISCOVERY!  BRING FRIENDS!"  The professor, Mystic Daredevil Jack Shadow and Robot Explorer Darius X-32 arrive by zeppelin.  Finding the surface site abandoned, the three make their way to the quartz cavern beneath where they find\u2026 DANGER!  The gigantic Time Excavator, powered from above by a series of solar collectors, is threatening to blow up making The Cavern Their Tomb!  A beam of strange energy from the Excavator has opened a circular portal on the cavern wall and a series of four-armed gargoyle-like "Scaled Ones" with electro-spears have poured out and are menacing Professor Petrova!  Ancient enemies of the Atlanteans, it is only a matter of time before one of the anachronistic Scaled Ones harms Sofia grievously.<br/><br/>The three Danger Patrol comrades leap into action and save the day.  Highlights include X-32's head convincing the remaining three Scaled Ones that he is their robot overlord.  Misinterpreting him somewhat, they are apparently convinced that Darius represents a prophesied "John the Baptist figure" (Roma Roma-ma)  that precedes their "silver messiah war god figure" that will help them vanquish the spired city of Rockets.  Through the portal, Dr. Spectre glimpses a possible alternate timeline where a vast army the Scaled Ones march on Rocket City.  In disarming the Time Excavator the members of Danger Patrol narrowly escape being sucked into the portal and thus into this alternate timeline, by the mystic powers of Jack Shadow's ancient ring.<br/><br/>Prof. Petrova, scaled underlings and X-32's missing robot monkey Tweeky in tow, the members of Danger Patrol return to Rocket city intent on investigating further into the mysteries that surround the day's bizarre events.<br/><br/>Jack Shadow goes to confront Simeon Silver, CEO of Titania Mining Corp., and current romantic interest of Jack's ex, Alexander Crane (seen previously in the "Previously On\u2026"scene; "From now on my only lover is DANGER!")  Simeon stonewalls at Jack's accusations of Titania Corps' bore-holes all over the ancient Martian sites, but Jack gets some clues in Simeon's reaction and discovers, at least, that Alexander still has feelings for him.  Jack leaves the two in a quarrel that will later prove to be even uglier than it appeared.<br/><br/>Dr. Spectre convinces Sofia to send him hurtling through time and space to the Library of Athena on earth in ancient Atlantis where he will research the ancient war prophecies of Atlantis.  He arrives at a time before his natural death and is fully corporeal.  He spends decades in the library researching the nature of the silver messiah and the prophecies and discovers that if the Scaled Ones vanquish the city of spires that Atlantis will rise again on its home world of Mars!  On his deathbed in ancient earth, Dr. Spectre conveys his essence into the mystical Ring of Gaia.<br/><br/>Arriving at the quartz cavern, Darius X-32 uses his precision sensors to investigate which of Petrova's assistants have sabotaged the Time Excavator to bend it to the will of a remote malefactor.  Sofia also needs help with the machine, whether from sabotage or Dr. Spectre's willful resistance, she's not been able to retrieve the ghost professor from the timestream.  <br/><br/>The final melee takes place with a returned Dr. Spectre and a teleported Jack Shadow aboard Simeon Silver's magna-zeppelin over the Feros Basin dig site with X-32 fighting off Crimson Republic agents Victor and Ivan below.  Simeon's zeppelin is influencing the Time Extractor below, once again threatening the future of Rocket City.  As Dr. Specter and Jack Shadow confront the mining CEO Simeon, he is forcing Alexander Crane to walk the plank and trying to tempt Dr. Spectre with the possibility of a reborn Atlantis that would follow naturally from the Scaled Ones' victory over Rocket City.   Jack Shadow swoops in to rescue Crane, straps his rocket pack onto him and then kicks him off the zeppelin, trusting to Alexander's instincts.  Simeon's presence seems to have mentally paralyzed Crane and it takes some last second derring-do from Jack to keep a grateful Crane in one piece.<br/><br/>Below, X-32 interposes his body into the malevolent energy beam between the Time Extractor and Simeon's zeppelin.  The violent reaction almost causes a chain reaction that threatens to kill Sofia and her remaining trustworthy assistants, but X-32 manages to keep things under control.  In so doing, the previously docile Scaled Ones finally determine that X-32 is *not* their agent in Rocket City's destruction and turn on him, dragging him away from the Time Extractor.  Dr. Spectre and X-32 ultimately prevent the alternate timeline and Jack takes out Simeon with a quip and a nasty right cross! <br/><br/>Danger Patrol wins again!  <br/><br/>Beta playtest comments and queries to follow as time allows.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265607/#Comment_265607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:58:46+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:58AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The awesomeness of Danger Patrol is that I got this far:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Ghost Professor Dr. Spectre</blockquote>\n... and I was already excited about the story.

(Point of order:  it's technically "Jack Shadow," as in "Hey ugly--have a taste of Jack Shadow! *POW*")<br/><br/>Matthew was very kind to give me a chance to actually PLAY Danger Patrol for the first time.  The pace was slightly more deliberate than I'm used to, but he also had a much firmer grasp of the rules (reducing reduced hits, framing countdown threats, etc) and did some really excellent tie-ins from our Previously On scenes.  As always with the stuff I play at his place, there was real attention paid to the presentational quality of the game:  nice thick paper stock for the character cards, the aforementioned soundtrack, and lots of big colorful pulp-cover printouts from which to draw inspiration for our episode title and theme.  That's the kind of thing that's hard to work into an AP, but it makes a real difference in the moment of play.<br/><br/>I felt almost guilty grabbing Mystic and Daredevil--I mean, they're the two coolest sheets, <i>come on</i>--but having Jack's lover and nemesis woven into the game gave him a nice anchor to the game world that made him feel like more than just a munchkin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265666/#Comment_265666" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T14:44:03+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  2:44PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 2:46PM by nemomeme.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beta stuff for JH:<br/><br/>Rules questions:<br/><br/>Does Helping create Danger?  If so, is the Danger assigned to the helper or the helped?  (GM's on-the-fly prerogative?)  If it creates Danger and it's applied to the helper then it's accurate to say that Helping is simply going simultaneously with the action/narration of the current player, yes?  If Helping does not create Danger, why not?<br/><br/>Power Tokens ability to "add +1 hit to a roll you just made"  I interpreted this as:<br/><br/>Brendan: "Let's see, that's three Successes and two Danger here against "Alexander's On The Plank!" (awesome narration)<br/>Me: "Hmmm\u2026  That's three total hits against that Threat, you\u2019re the last player to act, and that countdown is going to zero.  Not quite enough! (I've already established it as a major Threat)  "Alexander's so panicked he's not hitting the ignition switch on the rocket pack.  Looks like he's going to stain the landscape below with a nasty red splotch!  Unless you can do one more hit\u2026" (eyes Jack Shadow's power token hungrily). <br/>Brendan: "Yes!"  (spends Power token, more heroic narration)<br/><br/>If that's kosher then a little supporting explanation that it is kosher might be warranted.<br/><br/>Robot and Mystic both have split actions.  Do you generally combine the Danger between those two actions or keep those separate as well?  I tended to keep them separate.  Future examples might clarify this if you have a intentional design preference.<br/><br/>Other:<br/><br/>I really like the variable hits of the beta Threats relative to the 3/6/9/12 of alpha.  Very strong.  I stuck with my normal/major/elite/master mental categorization of my threats but it was nice to be able to have a 4 hit major threat or a 8 hit elite threat, for example.  The 4 hit major is a particular sweet spot because you can have a Threat which, if ignored, can spawn fun normal Threats, but is not itself particularly difficult to take out.<br/><br/>I also think the shift of Injured from being like a permanent Stunned to only being a Trait die reduction is a strong choice.  Less death spiral-ish, and while it didn't happen in our game, I could even see a player whose Danger meter is in the K.O.'d section making the intentional choice of marking an Injured box for a reduced hit over a Stunned box, depending on circumstances (how late in the scene, availability of bonus dice, countdowns that *must* be stopped).<br/><br/>I think the choice of Raygun, Electro-Blaster, or Turbo-Rifle is an artifact left over from when these choices carried mechanical support.  Since they don't any longer, you may wish to eliminate the choice or explicitly call the choice out as color and include a blank on the role card for a player-created weapon (a John Carter type might want a cavalry saber, for example).  Players might otherwise be rifling through the rules looking for the distinction.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's possible to munchkin Danger Patrol, but I'd like to see an Atomic Warrior in play; I suspect that's the 1337 if anything is.<br/><br/>David is still not enthralled with the "rigid" scene structure.  I don't mind it, but I might play with the scene framing a bit on subsequent plays where all the players have played the game before.  Following action scenes just free play along and identify questions and threats as they come along.  If you find other groups with a similar criticism, maybe that's offered in an "advanced" example or under "Other Stuff."  I think the focus of the game is one-shots and so probably the rigid scene structure is totally fine.  I do find myself wanting to play an "extended" 3-5 session game of Danger Patrol but suspect that most of this community is not up for the pace and genre of Danger Patrol except as the occasional awesome break from the norm of having their face stabbed in the hope and/or rolling to overcome their despair.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I don't know how far from the current scope you want to take Danger Patrol, but whatever your original intent I find myself wanting a final version that synthesizes the awesome Pulp plotting GM advice from Spirit of the Century with all the GM guidelines from Apocalypse World filtered through the Harper school of GM'ing and made available via the vehicle of Danger Patrol.  Rigid DP scene structures diminish the possibilities of that selfish hope for such a treatise somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
