It's like I'm playing a human in the Farscape 'verse.  Every race other than human gets a total of +2 to two different ability scores, humans only get +2 to one ability score.  Sure they get an extra trained skill from their class list (Eldarin get a choice of one trained skill as a racial characteristic).  It was even more egrarious in earlier editions of D&amp;D where humans might only get a bonus feat to start and no restriction on preferred class (D&amp;D 3.5), in AD&amp;D they simply had Dual-classing and no level cap.  So exactly why would I want to play a human?  An Eldarin gets +2 bonus to two skills, a bonus trained skill of my choice, bonuses to Will saves, bonus to saves vs Charm effects, a free weapon proficiency, and Teleport as an encounter power.  Humans get an extra feat, an extra class skill, +1 to their saves, and a once per encounter +4 to attack or save on a missed roll.<br/><br/>This phenomena isn't just limited to D&amp;D.  Farscape, Star Trek and Babylon 5 also do this to varying degrees.  Babylon 5 is probably the least egrarious in this respect.  In Farscape every alien race is superior to humans in one way or another.  Star Trek: Klingons are stronger and tougher, Vulcans are stronger, toughers, smarter, Andorians: stronger, tougher, Romulans same as Vulcans, Jem'Hadar etc etc etc.   About the only thing humans usually have going for them in any of these settings is diversity (and that's only in the fluff in D&amp;D).  The Essentials book Heroes of the Fallen Lands actually seems to neuter humans further from what they were in the PHB (to my recollection humans used to get a bonus at-will power from their class list).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301343/#Comment_301343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T19:31:20+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  7:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Historically in most editions of D&amp;D humans are assumed to be the dominant race of the setting. Consequently the designers have gone to some pains to ensure that this is reflected in the player character parties, too. It's not always been successful, of course, and the more recent editions have gone their own ways stylistically anyway.<br/><br/>That being said, I understand that the current edition has been pretty successful in balancing humans against other critters in that opinions are divided on whether humans are worthwhile or not. On the one hand that extra at-will attack is pretty impressive due to how it's not just a quantitive bonus to some dice rolls, but on the other hand it is true that humans come slightly behind in the numbers game against any single race that is optimal for a given character class. I wouldn't think that this is due to any intentional nerfing of humans, though; 4th edition is just made in a manner that makes a game too difficult to balance and maintain, so it's inevitable that a difficult design concept such as the "flexibility" that humans have will become questionable as the crunch landscape twists and evolves. Luckily it's easy to change this stuff for you own game if it bothers you.<br/><br/>In speculative fiction in general humans might seem "underpowered" compared to the cool aliens simply because the viewpoint is usually human, and thus the focus is on the alien. The television series you mention don't really say that humans are somehow worse, but they don't go out of their way to emphasize the positive qualities humanity as a race has, either. When you're building up Klingons or whatever as a dangerous threat as a scriptwriter, it'd be counter-productive to also spend time on building up humans similarly; we already know what humans are, and to a degree that actual plot of what happens will illustrate the scriptwriter's understanding of how and why humanity triumphs, without ever having to explify that humans are "braver than anybody else" or anything like that.<br/><br/>Despite all that, I think it's interesting to build different settings where humans are contrasted in different ways against other beings. I've seen settings where humans are the only intelligent species around (caveman genre, frex), ones where they're the only warlike species (favourite in military scifi), ones where they're the only ones who know love (three guesses where that comes from) and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>P.S: I like more descriptive thread titles, not much chance of me remembering what this one was about afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301344/#Comment_301344" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T19:42:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  7:42PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is, I think, the nature of the beast, particularly when the games are geared more towards Level-based advancement. Most of the reason to play humans over other races or species is, for the most part, fluff and background, rather than mechanical advantages. I can speak only up through D&amp;D 3.5 and the latest Star Wars (after which I pretty much swore off WOTC), but I think the advantages of the extra skill and feat just don't seem to "feel" equal to the modifiers and abilities of the other races. And, for the most part, I would say that is true. I always thought it would be more appropriate to give a few more skills, better saves, or advantages with cross-class skills.<br/>When it comes to balancing the advantages of the races, I think Warhammer Fantasy 2nd Ed. did a really good job. Of course, it was grittier, and the disadvantages to being non-human was being non-human. Nothing like the threat of being killed for having pointy ears to decide on being plain old human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301351/#Comment_301351" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T20:38:14+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  8:38PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2010 4:53AM by MikeRiverso.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For standard 4E, I think you're downplaying the bonuses that humans get. That extra at-will can be invaluable to some classes. For example, it can allow the wizard to have at-wills that target each of the non-AC defenses, allowing him to always find a weak point. The trained skill can be any skill, and is not limited like most other races. The extra feat is also invaluable, as most feats are equivalent to any one particular racial feature. Not to mention that humans get access to some awesome feats that other races don't (namely Action Surge). <br/><br/>For Essentials, I'll have to admit that I don't know much about the details. Taking away the extra at-will sucks, but was probably necessary because not all the classes work on the same power paradigm anymore. But that encounter power that you mention seems amazingly versatile and useful, whereas many other racial encounter powers tend to be more flavorful but only situationally useful. Note that +4 on a missed roll can allow you to hit with a daily power or save against a debilitating effect when it's desperately needed. There would be no reason not to use this power every encounter. <br/><br/>The name of the game with humans is flexibility and general utility. No other race gets as many options as humans do, nor do they get powers that are as generally useful.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm just speaking mechanically here.

D&amp;D has a long and complicated history with attempts to "emulate fiction". I mean, it's the whole reason why spellcasters were so overpowered in older editions in the first place. "Game balance" was not a concern in modern terms.<br/><br/>Humans are the baseline. Whether it's Star Trek, Farscape, Tolkien, Warcraft or whatever, humans are what the reader/viewer knows. They're generic, flexible, "normal". All the other races are deviations, stereotypes, archetypes, focusing on one (or few) specific aspects (elves are lithe, dwarves are sturdy, orcs are strong, halflings are sneaky...).<br/><br/>So, yeah, the other races get "big bonuses" but those bonuses are often rather specific and predetermined, demihumans are shoehorned. The stuff humans get might appear "weaker" but it's the flexibility that's the strength. I'm not that familiar with 4E, but in 3E that extra feat meant winning the game. Seriously. When you're building to optimize, that one extra feat meant A LOT, especially at early levels.<br/><br/>In my experience almost everyone played a human in 3E, if they didn't it was more for fluff reasons than for the bonuses.<br/><br/>In the old B/X games (not that familiar with AD&amp;D), demihumans needed two prime requisite scores, plus they had level limits. Playing a human was the only way to be a cleric or a palading or a thief. Sure the Dwarf was kinda a fighter-thief and the Elf was kinda a wizard-fighter, and the Halfling was a...pseudo thief, but only humans got to choose their class and they usually gained their XP faster, and could level further. Class/Race "balance" wasn't even on the table as an issue, imo.<br/><br/>In 3E, as I said, that flexibility humans had, plus the extra feat meant a lot. You picked another race either because you "wanted to be an elf" for fluff reasons or because you already had a very specific concept in mind, wanted to play a specific class. Frex if you wanted to be a wizard and your highest roll was 16 you picked Elf to get +2 INT so you could be a 18 INT wizard. But for almost everything else, human was best.<br/><br/>4E, again, not as familiar, but I never perceived them as being shafted, mechanically. Otherwise I think it's much the same as before: If you want to be "anyone" you play a human and be heroic, or cunning, or strong, or smart, or whatever, but basically a human. In a very Tolkien way, even. A light in the dark, a hope for the future, a small weak thing in a big dark world, fighting to the light. But also very corruptible. If you want to be a dragonborn you're the tough dude and that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301378/#Comment_301378" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T02:45:51+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  2:45AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason humans sucked in AD&amp;D is because people didn't play by the rules.

Sure, elves may have +2 to perception (for example) but +2 to what average score? The human's average score, that's what, because humans are one thing everyone is bound to know something account since they are one. This means that humans in general are often not better than all the other races at any one specific thing. Instead they get labelled 'generalists', and given more points in other areas to allow them the liberty of being more diverse. In a way they have a flexible racial bonus you can choose to aim at any ability you like. For some reason this may be seen as an unfair advantage to the humans; you don't get what you're given, you pick what you get. Therefore, you get less of it. Of course this is only really true if the skills the other races are getting boosts in are less than average in their usefulness compared to the other skills available. And then there's the exotic allure of playing something that you don't *have* to be every day of your life, that can be a big draw.<br/><br/>That's my guess at how the current state of affairs evolved anyway.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301402/#Comment_301402" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T05:13:33+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  5:13AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thought <br/><br/>If humans as a group are balanced because humans are generality, it is quite likely that individual humans are not balanced against members of other groups.

A good, though probably outdated, answer might be to compare a vanilla dwarf and a human. Dwarf says 'I am a dwarf, therefore I can see in the dark and I'm quite good at stonecutting.' Human might then say 'I'm a human. I can't see in the dark, but I spent all of my bonus stuff on Stonecutting-related stuff, so now I am in fact better than you at that one particular thing.'<br/><br/>That's a pretty extreme example mind, and I'll happily admit that my knowledge of modern Fantasy (D&amp;D in particular) is outdated since I've not played in a game since 3.0 edition.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301553/#Comment_301553" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T11:49:12+00:00" title="November 20, 2010 11:49AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played in a Star Trek Mortal Coil game (great mechanical fit between system and setting, by the way!), we decided that humans' deal was that they were specifically better at being both explorers and diplomats than other races.  This may seem generic in the context of most Star Trek fiction, since so much of it is about exploration and diplomacy, but it's really not trivial and makes a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301599/#Comment_301599" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T00:27:28+00:00" title="November 21, 2010 12:27AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Humans were the optimal racial choice in 3 and 3.5 once you reached mid-level. All of the other standard race's abilities became pretty meaningless, but the skill points kept adding up, which made human fighters in particular a much more appealing option. As far as 4e goes, Humans are... good enough. They fit well when nothing else will. In earlier edition (2e and before) if you played by the rules not every one qualified to be a demihuman (ability score wise) and level limits were serious business and most of the racial abilities could be ignored outside of a dungeon setting (halfling and elf stealth being the exception, but that had a whole lot of limitations as well).<br/><br/>And I've watched a lot of Star Trek and it seems to me the show is constantly focused on how humans are better than the other races because their humans. Kirk is just more able than Spock, despite all of Spock's super powers. The same goes for Pacard and Data or Janeway and Tuvok. The problem with gaming this is the human advantage as portrayed in Star Trek and a lot of other sci-fi is far less tangible than the advantages of other races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301616/#Comment_301616" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T05:39:49+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  5:39AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Humans are probably the best race in 4th edition. You may only get one stat bonus, but you can put it anywhere you like. The bonus skill is useful, especially in conjunction with the background rules from PHB2 that give you easy access to non-class skills. The bonus feat is huge now that we are in the era of maths-fixing feats such as weapon expertise and the new 'defence expertise' things from the Essentials line. Humans are also the only race that can take Action Surge, which is itself one of the best feats in the game. Finally, humans either get an extra at-will (great for some classes, mediocre for others) or the new heroic effort thing that gives you a substantial bonus to an important dice roll once per encounter, which is amazing. If this latter ability existed as a feat, almost everyone would buy it for their characters as a matter of course. It's that good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301763/#Comment_301763" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T13:50:30+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  1:50PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>The reason humans sucked in AD&amp;D is because people didn't play by the rules.</blockquote>\nSay more about this?<br/><br/>Well, for one, ignoring the level limits imposed on demi-humans was common.  Either that or the group simply quit a campaign and started over when the restrictions actually started to matter.  The bonus of playing a non-restricted human thus was negated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
