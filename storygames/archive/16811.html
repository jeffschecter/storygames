The classic throwback is the bonus/subtraction to a damage or toughness stat, usually requiring an additional roll but sometimes applied to the attack roll (D&amp;D/Shadowrun/M&amp;M). Some others give a flat bonus for using any weapon, regardless of what it is (HK-TK/Technoir). Then come the games, like SotC, that use weapons as a tool to be able to make use of a skill, giving no additional benefit. While games like Wushu don't use any weapon mechanics at all, calling them "flavor" instead.<br/><br/>I see the benefit of each type. Sometimes you want a little crunch in your dessert, sometimes you don't. But most of these are pretty standard for games of different focuses - story or meta. And the impact on other systems within the game become more or less complicated depending on the weapon style you use (you have to tread more carefully in the creation of spell mechanics when weapons give a bonus, creating an equalizing factor in the spells).<br/><br/>What are some unique weapons systems you've seen in the games you play? How did they impact the other systems of the game (spells, powers, unarmed combat, etc.)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383649/#Comment_383649" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T17:58:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  5:58PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guns in <i>DitV</i>: they escalate conflict to a different arena.

Do more and it takes off the armor's HP. Once the HPs are depleted the armor no longer protects. I've toyed with adding more nuance to armor but found it just makes things unmanageable.

Instead of 1d20 you roll to hit with 3d6, ok? Now, the funny part is, all weapons do 1d6 damage, always. But you don't roll for damage separately, you just pick one of the d6s you just rolled to hit! Which one? <i>It depends.</i> If you have an advantage (fictional positioning, bitches!) you take the high d6, if you're fighting at a disadvantage you take the low d6, otherwise you take the middle d6. Yes, it's a DM's judgment call, in the end!<br/>The way I make weapons different from each other is that what kind of weapon(s) you're using definitely factors into whether you're fighting with an advantage or disadvantage. Your opponent's weapon, also. But which weapon's "better", it depends on the battlefield and circumstances. An open field and blocks of troops engaging is not the same as a handful of men defending a doorway against a thousand zombies which is not the same as rolling in the mud wrestling a rabid wererat in pitch-black darkness.<br/>If you're into renaissance technology porn as much as I am, then kinds of weapons vs. armor types factor when adjudicating advantage and disadvantage <i>besides</i> armor also granting AC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383662/#Comment_383662" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T19:22:46+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  7:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Riddle of Steel takes an interesting and funky approach.

Quick summary: we do martial arts based on surviving 13th-16th century fechtbuchen (folios describing the martial arts of the time). The real fun: we do full contact martial arts with real weapons using real techniques.<br/><br/>So, the geek out cometh!<br/><br/>Riddle of Steel is a great place to look, because the author is another HEMA practitioner (he's actually a lot more famous in the HEMA crowd than he is in the RPG crowd). Personally, I find RoS a bit too close to Swords Path Glory - it doesn't suit my play style.<br/><br/>One of the things I really get worked up about is that no historical weapon is "strictly better" than any other. Each has a purpose and a place. I think Pendragon had a good go at providing a reason for a knight to use an axe in some situations, a mace in other, etc.<br/><br/>When I first bought AW, I immediately looked for how weapons were handled (as I do with all games). I was very pleased. Not with the exact rules as written, but with the "tag" system. It's the same approach I've been using in my house games for years! As a result, my current house game is now an AW hack, set in the Hundred Years War (ok, I lie, that's one of many reasons I decided on an AW hack, and not the most important). It includes weapon rules which I find evocative, representative, and easy to use (but then, I *would* say that). If anybody would like to see the current rules draft, whisper to me (it's not quite ready for full public sharing yet).<br/><br/>A key element, for me, is that weapon rules have to be integrated into fighting rules so that there isn't the "I go, he goes, who takes how much damage?" thing. The fighting rules don't have to be complicated, but (for me) they have to result in fights that feel like fights I've been in (whether real ones, competitive ones, training ones, whatever). That puts me squarely *outside* the usual audience! As far as I can tell, most RPGers prefer fights resemble either wargames or comic books. I think both of those are totally valid, by the way, and I have enjoyed many games with rules that give that feel - but it's not my current taste.<br/><br/>So sing the Monty Python song with me: "Every sword... is different... every sword is great... if any sword... gets +1... God gets quite irate..."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383713/#Comment_383713" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T07:36:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  7:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pallidum use to come out with an updated Compendium of Modern Firearms.

I will say this though, being a hunter, I know what a shotgun does to a man sized target (deer). The reason I bring it up is damage to a living thing does not follow the HP paradigm. It almost entirely follows how much blood loss there is and if the heart is stopped. Doe are far easier to take down in a single shot than a buck is. Just this year I shot a buck, I missed his heart by an inch and he ran for over a half mile before he finally collapsed.<br/><br/>The key is if the target goes into shock. That said a knife can cause shock. A broadsword can cause shock. They may not, based on how "tough" the person is.<br/><br/>Where I live, there was a an Iraq vet that came back to the states and got shot five times in the chest (small caliber like a .22 I think). He plugged the holes with the fingers on one hand and chased down his attacker.

I don't mean to be rude, but I'm afraid this is utterly wrong. It's a myth that ignores archeological evidence, forensic evidence, documentary evidence, and basic metallurgy.<br/><br/>Next up: the idea that you "bash" at an opponent in armour. This is also way off base. There are very different techniques used in blossfechten ("naked" fighting) and harnischfechten (armoured fighting), of course. But there's no "bashing". Nor does real sword-fighting look much like most movies! It's perfectly possible to kill a man in full harness (what we RPGers often call "plate armour") with a longsword, but it isn't done by swinging the thing like a baseball bat.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jurgen">@Jurgen</a>: there are definitely differences of degree with weapons. It's easier to notice when comparing, say, how hard a pollaxe hits with how hard a hatchet or carpenter's hammer hits. But the difference between a longsword used two-handed and an arming sword used one-handed is mostly speed. The longsword is MUCH faster. That speed and leverage means a simple false edge cut without any real "swing" to it can be delivered with enough force to kill, whereas with an arming sword, that type of flick motion won't be as deadly. Given time for a full cut, or a draw cut, or a full extension thrust, yeah, the arming sword hits just as hard, penetrates just as far, etc, as a longsword.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Onix">@Onix</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>: I agree completely that "damage" is a very difficult thing to quantify. I used to get very concerned about trying to "model" that, until I spent a bunch of time doing vehicular damage modelling for my work. At that point, I decided that (for me), a simple, fast playing system that provided fiction guidelines was better (again, for me).<br/><br/>Getting back to the OP... Personally, weapons and fighting are big part of the fun of RPGs, because they're something I can't do (and don't want to do!) in real life. Sure, I practice and train with them, but I don't ever want to be in a position of trying to hurt real people. So, for me, it's a thrill to have fights in RPGs. But, at the same time, if those fights seem artificial to me, it can take the fun out of it. That's a personal thing, not a game design thing. So I would rather see weapons handled entirely abstractly than poorly. For the intersection of "most game designers" and "my personal taste", that means I tend to prefer games with abstracted (or non-existent) weapons. Dogs in the Vineyard, Pendragon, and 3:16 are examples of games that handle weapons well (again, for my personal taste). Palladium, D&amp;D, Shadowrun, and Leading Edge are examples of games I find hard to take. Riddle of Steel is one of the few "high detail" games that kind of works for me (although, as I mentioned, it doesn't suit my current play style).<br/><br/>And, of course, the rules for fighting are tied into this. My personal bent is that trying for a lot of precise detail results mostly in artificial limits. If it plays like a tactical wargame, it's probably completely unlike being in a fight (don't get me wrong, I enjoy tactical wargames).<br/><br/>tl;dr: weapons are fun, complex, and not the key to a good game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383856/#Comment_383856" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T04:25:38+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  4:25AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What are some unique weapons systems you've seen in the games you play?

Armor also comes in three classes (street, clink, and tactical) which have their own profiles of effectiveness against each damage class (for instance, clink armor, which is basically medieval armor, performs best against edged weapons and not so great against  piercing weapons and guns), and come in heavy versions as well that add a flat bonus across the profile. Damage is rolled on tables (one for each damage class), with armor penalizing the roll according to its profile. All deadly weapons have a base 1 in 20 chance of inflicting an immediately fatal wound, but otherwise the outcomes are weighted differently for each table (blunt weapons are more likely to cause broken bones, piercing weapons are weighted mostly toward incidental wounds and life-threatening wounds (e.g. organ puncture) without much in the middle). There's no difference between small weapons and huge weapons in damage terms (there is in reach terms) unless you're physically huge too.<br/><br/>There's a lot of abstraction that I had to accept (the biggest deal: swords, knives, and axes are all classed as "edged"and therefore interact with armor and cause wounds identically, which isn't accurate at all, but was the closest I could come without adding even more damage classes), but overall it works quite well and I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>Edit: here's a thread from the Forge where I go in-depth on these rules and the thought behind them: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32346.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32346.0</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383937/#Comment_383937" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T18:56:28+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  6:56PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I joyfully anticipate an rpg that allows me to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordstreich" rel="nofollow">murder-strike</a> my favourite of all documented historical attacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clebsch" title="Clebsch"><img alt="Clebsch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nP8QY8XH7847T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clebsch">Clebsch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383941/#Comment_383941" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T19:24:25+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  7:24PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a>: The Morrow Project and Swords Path Glory had the same approach.

And forensic archeologists (particularly at Towton and Wisby, although other places as well) have shown that armoured fighters were killed on the battlefield by a variety of weapons, not just daggers and swords (the most likely grappling weapons - swords at half-sword, obviously), but pollaxes, warhammers, maces, axes, spears, etc.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean armour was ineffective! The low percentage of dead in battles tells us the opposite. But it does tell us a man in harness was not invulnerable.<br/><br/>I agree totally that massed combat descriptions aren't common. And where they exist, they are (as far as I know) personal: describing someone's experience either in a battle or watching a battle. We know a bit more about foot against armoured horse than we know about armoured foot fighting each other. We do know that heavy horse and heavy foot both fought in extremely close formation: heavy horse would interlock their knees *while charging*, which kind of blows my mind. But then, a disciplined charge was made at the trot, which also blows my mind. We also know that armoured foot was very resilient to charges, and that disciplined unarmoured foot with pole weapons or pikes were resilient to charges as well.<br/><br/>We don't even really know how the "push of pike" occurs! We know what it is, and that is happened, but if you watch reenactors, they'll reach a point where both sides raise their pikes in order to get to the push. Which is definitely cheating...<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just babbling now, sorry. What I really mean to say is: I agree, as far I know (but I'm not an expert), there's a lot of missing detail about battles.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383964/#Comment_383964" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T06:24:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  6:24AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kind of love how little information there is about historical fighting techniques and practices, especially in comparison to the amount of hot air blown about them on the internet.<br/><br/>In games I think it's far more important to focus on giving players interesting choices than on making things seem "realistic", especially since for the people I play with, we have very little idea what "real" is like when it comes to fighting.<br/><br/>My current favourite thing is to focus more on initiative than on striking and damage. We have a simple roll to hit/roll damage system, but then a complex (and mostly ad hoc) system of initiative which considers range, weapon reach, weapon weight, fighting technique, and so on. With very deadly combat (from low HP), it means there's a lot of attention paid to details of fighting. It's a standard technique now for the players to carry a spear for facing a charge, but have a short sword handy for the melee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clebsch" title="Clebsch"><img alt="Clebsch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nP8QY8XH7847T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clebsch">Clebsch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383967/#Comment_383967" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T07:16:42+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  7:16AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>: that sounds fun!

There are so many games though, I think it would be pretty cool if someone was to put together a realistic combat simulation. Even if it played like axis and allies and each turn took forever, it would be fun to play at least once.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383970/#Comment_383970" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T09:01:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  9:01AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Hollowpoint</i> weapons do whatever the fiction dictates.

But even without these present, a weapon might have an aspect which can be tagged for a bonus provided relevant narrative is provided. For example, a Desert Eagle pistol might have the aspect "enormous handgun" in which case it could logically be tagged to increase damage, but also to intimidate, or it might be compelled to expose it when it ought to be concealed.
