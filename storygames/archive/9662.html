It's important that everyone around the table is pushing for the same kind of thing, but if they're not, it doesn't necessarily mean your game will explode. It doesn't matter that much WHAT you're all pushing for, really, or if there's a goddamned name for it, as long as you are pushing for something all in roughly the same ballpark.<br/><br/>As far as I can remember from my lurking days way back in Forge history, Creative Agenda came about because of clashes in play styles. Some people were pushing for X and other people were pushing for Y, and it wasn't a difference they knew how to fix. Some groups seem to mix X and Y and Z in their games and no one gets frustrated, bored, or mad. But other groups do implode when these "agenda clashes" occur, and the theory sprang up to explain what the fuck was going on.<br/><br/>In the end, the GNS categories might turn out to be incomplete or totally fucking arbitrary. Me, I think they're descriptive. Whatever. It doesn't matter. They're just some labels people slapped on different kinds of play they were seeing. They tried to use these labels to predict different things about these kinds of play, and use those predictions to make different kinds of games. To that end, GNS theory has been pretty successful.<br/><br/>What happens if we can't identify GNS in actual play? Nothing. Nothing at all. Is your game fun? Yeah? Awesome. No? What are you pushing for in the game? What makes you happy in the game? What about all your friends? Are you all on the same page? No? That's likely the problem right there. You're on the same page, but the game still explodes? Do the rules support what you and your friends want out of the game? No? Maybe that's the problem. There: that's all you need to know about Creative Agenda theory.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214562/#Comment_214562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T11:31:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 11:31AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we didn't have GNS, what other opportunities would we have to pedantically correct people and win Internet Points?

I'm not saying that people haven't found GNS useful. In fact, I said, "They tried to use these labels to predict different things about these kinds of play, and use those predictions to make different kinds of games. To that end, GNS theory has been pretty successful." So I'm complete agreement there.<br/><br/>GNS and Big Model theory get people thinking about stuff. That's awesome. Designers consider different things when they create games. That, too, rocks. However, what you think G, N, and S are, and what rules you think "support" those things may differ in some important ways from what other designers (and players) think. That doesn't matter so much. What matters is that the theory got you thinking about how rules guide play. Sweetness.<br/><br/><br/>To no one in particular: I don't want this thread to be a bashdown of people. Let's talk about GNS and theory as things and try to keep it on the positive side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214571/#Comment_214571" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T11:47:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 11:47AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me also go on record that I have been, in the past, one of those annoying GNS wankers who throws GNS shit in people's faces.

Even when (usually when?) the original thrust of the theory wasn't about that at all. <br/><br/>I think it was McLuhan who said "People these days want roles (things to be) instead of goals (things to do)." And I think a lot of GNS talk falls into that kind of category. Rather than talking about games, and the games we play, as ongoing processes -- things that we're doing that are in motion and fluid -- we find it easier to talk about them in terms of set categories and roles. Thus we focus less on the ongoing decisions and overall arcs of games that influence agenda, and want to label the game as THIS THING and then make every moment of the game fit into the role of THIS THING THAT THIS GAME IS. <br/><br/>If you let GNS be genres that talk about the overarching goals and trended patterns of play, they're perfectly useful. But the "what role is this game/this player/this one moment" game is often much less useful. At that point it isn't about analyzing and understanding, its about finding a box that the game can be put safely into so that it can be contained and quantified. <br/><br/>Which is something we've been on about for years, really. From the "There is no "narrativist gamer" damnit" discussion to the "Narrativism is a way of playing, not a text without players" and on and on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214576/#Comment_214576" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:04:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My perspective as a player and aspiring designer is to play games that support the kind of play I enjoy. I know I like fairly deep exploration of character, especially when I'm reacting to some kind of morally charged scenario.<br/><br/>As a kid, I loved playing my demon-summoner in rounds of <i>Everway</i>; that gave us our first crack at in-character vs. out of character information, and we grew because of it. My goal was to try and portray someone good who used highly suspect means to do those good things, and it created some nice tension and distance among the PCs. But that was me being a Prima Donna - it was all about *me* contributing this to the story, and the other players more or less playing X-Men with their cool powers.<br/><br/>In college, I played a campaign of <i>Exalted</i> from start to finish as an Abyssal, one who grew disillusioned by the infighting between Deathknights and decided, in the last scene of the last session, to turn and join the Solars on the other side of the battle so that at least my guy would be fighting for something that someone *else* believed in, too. I had an audience of one - another player who was running an Abyssal, and had to settle for getting my jollies that way. That game, honestly, was mostly mind-numbing combats and railroaded "plot developments", and it was only us Abyssals that seemed to have any emotional investment whatsoever in the game, so it was only when the action was on us did it seem like any kind of story was going on.<br/><br/>That's what I was looking for, and I rely, in part, on GNS now to help me find the kinds of games that might support such play. Crunch gets in my way, but arguably there are different kinds of it: there's mechanical crunch, yeah, but I'd say there's such a thing as setting-crunch, too: a measure of how much intricate detail is provided in the rulebook to explain the setting the developers envision. <br/><br/>These are the issues that I have with game design, what I'm looking for, and what I'm trying to avoid. GNS has helped me a lot with that, as have various "hippie" techniques like player authority and conflict resolution, which aren't part of GNS per se, despite their proximity to that community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214578/#Comment_214578" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:06:39+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played enough times without a common creative agenda, and with one, to (1) know the difference, and (2) know that it's fucking really important: it's the difference between "ehw... yeah...  not bad... had it moments..." and "AWESOME!".<br/><br/>Seeing that I play to enjoy the game, that difference is the most important.

If a game work, you have only to follow the rules and enjoy the game, without ever worrying about CA in your life (and please, do so, instead of entering these two circles above...).

I care about these things in the order of N, S, G, with the latter two running a distant second. A little flavor or a well-written motif that makes something feel very [whatever the genre or setting is] can be a lot of fun, but it doesn't compare with interesting mechanics that cover escalation of conflict, personal motivations, moral dilemmas, etc. Stuff that  doesn't reference at all *who* the person is or what they care about, well, such rules are things I'd tear right out of the book. At this point, I'm starting to care a lot less about Ron's (once-upon-a-time) apparently ironclad insistence that Premise had to be a ... thing, in our games, if we were going to do Story Now. The way that whole essay is framed (and yeah, it's a few years old) is such that you <i>must</i> have a Premise, capital P, like it's some kind of separate thing. <br/><br/>I think my problem has been that I've been misreading Ron. The idea is probably more like "put a moral conflict or quandary right there into the setting or situation, or make rules that create characters who get into such situations", and then character creation, followed by play, are when the players do things to indicate their response to that quandary. Premises are rarely specific as-given in the game text; "what will you do for power?" is incredibly! generalized, so it doesn't get in our way. Ugh, I'm glad that this thread has helped me to see that. It didn't help that the Forge has that term "Timid Virgin", which is a fine concept but puts a huge emphasis on getting Nar play "right", which then sets one up to try and read the mind of an internet article-writer and yearn for some exact photocopy of whatever it was he "meant". Ba-lech. <br/><br/>Also: you're right that those things don't touch on GNS. That was my response to Paul's demand for a discussion of the "actual issues of play". <br/><br/>Moreno,<br/>My biggest beef with the haters is that they almost never actually say *what* their problem with the Big Model, CAs, or anything is. They leave off at ad hominem attacks, vague statements that boil down to "other people aren't Gamist, and that makes me angry", and so on.<br/>Actually, the blogs RPGPundit and Whitehall ParaIndustries are great examples of these behaviors - both writers seem to heavily favor Stepping On Up above all else, which is great, but they also seem somewhat or greatly incapable of appreciating that other people might play differently. When half of an RPG blog's posts are about awesome guns, chances are good that person's play priorities are way more tactical than mine. <br/><br/>Secondly, with regard to getting things "right", it amazes me how often I come up with an idea for a Story Now-style game, and then realize that the Premise I'm working on would easily be adaptable to all kinds of settings, eras, places, etc. <i>Sorcerer</i> is a good example of this. It makes me realize that setting-less mechanics, like Vincent's "Otherkind dice", jettison Right to Dream more or less altogether in favor of pure exploration of desires and consequences, independent of "where it's happening". The realization that we can play pirates one night, and Prohibition cops the next, and use the same "universal" system, is a way to circumvent the problem of near-omnipresent Right to Dream as a secondary Agenda in Story Now design. I think that's an interesting design goal, if nothing else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214591/#Comment_214591" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:56:02+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><br/>My biggest beef with the haters is that they almost never actually say *what* their problem with the Big Model, CAs, or anything is.

As a result its merely descriptive as apposed to prescriptive. There are no Gamist Games or Gamist players merely gamist tendencies in extended cycles of play over cycles of reward. There is no way to ' help ' people fix their differing creative agenda because the observation ends at, lol CA divergence go get a new group. <br/><br/>Theirs a lot of pseudo science/psycology/terminology floating arround along with a large base of users who don't agree amongst themselves over what half the stuff means (even important stuff like S or is that s dammnit) but still insist on trying to use and regulate the usage of these vague things. (generally with links to old and huge things that supposedly have the definition in there somewhere used as both a tactic to avoid whatever we were actually talking about and as a tactic to try to claim to be an expert of some kind.)<br/><br/>Really taking it not seriously, its okay, because the strongest thing it seems to me to say is that 'bob and pat didn't enjoy playing shadowrun together, because they wanted different things from it" that's not so bad, but when people start going on about how forge games are bringing the narrative impulse back into story games it raises hackles because A&gt; You really can't say that (Ca talk about things over play over reward cycles not games or players) B&gt; For being so great these forge games are still more or less the fringe of a fringe of a fringe C&gt; if you try to say that you get directed to 6 year old forum threads because 'then you'll understand'.<br/><br/>Moral of the story, those of us who disagree, I think have a leg to stand on, I dont think we're being terribly unreasonible or onery (except the pundit, but really no one takes him any more serious than ron and his braindamage so how about some cheritible reading on a two way street.), and I dont think we are some how hobbled from understanding what we want or what others want at the table and addressing that however you want. <br/><br/>Perhaps a little bit too serious buziness here, but I really appreciate the bone Adam is throwing here for more or less everyone to get it, and I think trying to describe the otherside as 'gamist' who can't see the forest threw the trees or as angry crazy insane and not to be listened to people isn't helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214592/#Comment_214592" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T13:01:25+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  1:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imagine if any other substantial body of theory of any kind had been developed on Internet forums and Internet forums only.

The GNS labels DON'T HELP if people don't understand them, and in this case they can be more an obstacle than an help.<br/><br/>Almost always, when someone show up (at the Forge or elsewhere) talking about the problem he have with his game/group and use Big Model terms, they hide the real problem because he doesn't really understand them. The first thing is convince him to describe his problems WITHOUT using these terms, but using actual play examples.<br/><br/>Maybe the "forge jargon" problem is that it seems too easy. When people hear "narrativism" they always think they already know what it does mean ("you have to talk in character!").  Even "story now" is still too easy.  Something like "The crimson road of the exalted story now zen master" would instill a little more doubt, or at least the sense of having to understand what does it mean before using it...  ;-)<br/><br/>I don't know anybody who ever "got" GNS without having a sort of "game epiphany", some situation where they enjoyed a game much, much more than usual, a order of magnitude better that usual. THEN they usually can use GNS to understand what it was and how to get at it again, but you have to play with a common creative agenda before "getting" GNS, not the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214607/#Comment_214607" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T15:47:46+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  3:47PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Condiments don't matter, because either way you're eating a hot dog and you can always scrape off the ones you don't like.  <br/><br/>I see GNS as being a language to describe gaming -- not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the </span> language, and not a complete theory of gaming.

I don't get the condiment analogy, though. <br/><br/>Moreno,<br/>The labels suffer from one of the problems that much of academia suffers - consider the difference between theme and motif (like what they REALLY mean, in your textbook), or think, generally, about how psychology uses commonplace words to describe highly specific things. It's a label that seems to fit best, once the concept has been arrived at. But yeah, there's no way around some serious front-loading if jargon is going to happen.<br/>Hell, much of the "terminology" is outdated and slangy, at best - phrases like Timid Virgin and El Dorado capture specific moments in design history rather than techniques or broad methods of interpreting play. <br/>Also - yeah, Story Now is tricky because you need to have the "Now" explained to you with some kind of context. From my own direct experience of play, it always felt like "no story at all" or "weak story" rather than "oh, it'll come later". It's not intuitive. Should it be? Not if it results in compromising the definitions of terms. But it wouldn't kill us to make terms that are less esoteric.<br/>I'm sure most fields of study and/or design feel the same. <br/><br/>Misuba,<br/>I would agree, and I think the problem arises in part because there is no formalized 'intro' to the whole process. Talk of a textbook for Forge theory has been happening for years, just so we don't have to say "go here and here" quite so much anymore.<br/>Honestly, though, we refer people here and there and everywhere *because* there's not a well-codified one-stop-shop for intro to theory. You can't take a class on this (in the U.S., anyway).

I'm talking about the kind of discourse that forums afford. First, you have the mix of conversation dynamics with the removal of emotional context that always comes with words on a screen. Forums are just discussion-like enough to make people forget that they're missing the huge chunk of a discussion that you get when you're talking face to face... and we're trying to do real work with this fake discussion. Real work would happen just fine if everyone were forced to adopt an academic tone instead of a conversational one (or at least, the passive aggression would take more craft and hence be more fun for all parties).<br/><br/>Second, there's the sequential-but-asynchronous thing: post-at-the-bottom means that people just feel invited to throw their two cents in, regardless of whether they really need to, just because it's "their turn" or something. It is good that post-at-the-bottom keeps discussions moving forward - threading for the lose! - but it has other social side effects.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214661/#Comment_214661" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T09:02:19+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  9:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Removing Creative Agenda from the Big Model to save some people's self image (or, more probably, simply to save us from more internet flames) isn't like removing Evolutionary theory to avoid harassments from creationists? <br/><br/>Thinking about it, CA and ET have much in common.

Not with the same scientific rigor that can be used to test physic theories, but still, it was "tested" by me alone with a big enough number of "subjects" to prove it to me.  <br/><br/>It must be remembered that the Big Model don't talk about what people have in their heads, doesn't measure "immersion", or "enjoyment", or "personal imagination". It's a social model that talk about something observable: communications and gameplay.  <br/><br/>A better communication between the players, a better gameplay (as in "with less problems, arguments and with people visibly more satisfied during the game and at the end") IS observable, and it can be observed, when there is a certain "coherence" between the player's idea of "what a role-playing game is" (for people who only play with one CA) or "what we are playing this time" (for people who change CA sometime). And more difficulties, problems, and lack of useful communication can be observed in gaming groups that lack this coherence, where people roll their eyes when some other player do something that don't align with their idea of what the game is.<br/><br/>It's not a subatomic particle, it's a very common phenomenon that every player that play with a lot of different groups and games can easily observe. And the Big Model (and the CA) is ALL about what can be observed during a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214703/#Comment_214703" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T13:52:39+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  1:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I am not saying that forge theory is unchallengeable or unchangeable: there are lot of people who can debate against forge theory, or some part of it, without resorting to the moronic arguments used by the people you talked about.

What has kept jazz alive (and defines jazz, to me) is the sense of exploration and rebellion while still respecting the tradition.<br/><br/>Is the same true for game design?<br/>&lt; /jazzgeek &gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214837/#Comment_214837" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T10:19:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 10:19AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Komrade,<br/>Could you give us an example of "a bunch of switching back and forth between them in practice," or "Also, some games that theoretically support one of those broken out agendas, really don't necessarily, or even regularly.

Not with the same scientific rigor that can be used to test physic theories, but still, it was "tested" by me alone with a big enough number of "subjects" to prove it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt must be remembered that the Big Model don't talk about what people have in their heads, doesn't measure "immersion", or "enjoyment", or "personal imagination". It's a social model that talk about something observable: communications and gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nA better communication between the players, a better gameplay (as in "with less problems, arguments and with people visibly more satisfied during the game and at the end") IS observable, and it can be observed, when there is a certain "coherence" between the player's idea of "what a role-playing game is" (for people who only play with one CA) or "what we are playing this time" (for people who change CA sometime). And more difficulties, problems, and lack of useful communication can be observed in gaming groups that lack this coherence, where people roll their eyes when some other player do something that don't align with their idea of what the game is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not a subatomic particle, it's a very common phenomenon that every player that play with a lot of different groups and games can easily observe. And the Big Model (and the CA) is ALL about what can be observed during a game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things:<br/>\nWhat was your N, how did you select for participants, what where the parameters of your population, &amp;c.; What I'm saying is that you didn't use the same rigor that the social sciences apply when discussing and testing social theories. You have no methodology or method and therefore no test.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunication and gameplay are in people's heads. I suggest taking a look at Berger and Luckmann's seminal work <u>The Social Construction of Reality</u>. It's very readable and they specifically write so that the read need not have any academic background. And then the forty years of phenomenologically informed social theory that followed. That, or the whole paradigm of Symbolic-Interaction; still a major school of thought in social theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your being fallacious when you assume that "every player" that play with different groups observes or experiences similar things, moreover that they are easily observed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Big Model and all that may very well be a theory but it certainly has not being thoroughly researched or tested in any way that I would vaguely place any faith in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214863/#Comment_214863" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T12:09:33+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 12:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Universalis would be the easier one to discuss. Uni is pretty much widely considered to be with in the Narr-influenced school of design.<br><br>OTOH, it has exactly jack-all designwise to do with characters facing moral quandries andd watching how they react. Instead, it's all about player authority over fiction and its distribution among the play group as a whole. Arguably, it's also about story developed in play, as opposed to before or after play. So in that regard, it fits with the concept of "story now!' in a broad sense.<br><br>The actual mechanics of tenets strongly enables defining and refining the style and tone of play, as well as the game world itself, something entirely suited to stuff classically classified as Sim-play, provided that your concept of sim supportive mechanics is broader than "physics engine" mechanics.<br><br>As for challenge between players, it definitely can be played as a game of one-upsmanship and a challenge for players to either roll with introduced elements or offer something of their own in contradiction. It's another sort of challenge, but certainly within the realm of stepping on up, especially at the player level.<br>_____<br><br>Ass for general play, I just plain see a lot of drifting back and forth of playstyles as people play more together, and I don't see, at least for myseelf, any real indication that groups eventually drift in one direction or another permanently. Rather, there seem to be fits and spurts in many directions until the local group gels in a very group-specific agenda, and even that can change with time and interest. I think that the idea of a group having bits of other-aganda fun, but only briefly, is pehaps just plain wrong. I also don't see this as a phenomenon related to "mainstream" rpgs only.<br><br>I've played Dogs in the Vineyard in a way that flipped between all three suggested aggendas in a single session, and I acn't name any one of them as the part that I or the whole of the group was enjoying most or predominantly.

I don't see this as contradictory: the game simply isn't that focused in GNS terms, and you need to choose what you're doing when you start play. I suspect that the narrativist experience is much more common in Universalis due to how the game interacts with a player's need to express his vision, but it doesn't get in the way of a certain sort of simulationism, either. The group chemistry plays a large part in this: you need a fruitful friction between player visions to get narrativism to work in the game, while a well-played consensus leads to a dull simmy game.

Using the chargen and raises/sees/give dice system sparked challenge for me, as did the narration of fictional stuff itself ( and it also seemed to me that the GM was feeling a different kind of challenge himself). Personally, i also felt a sense of challenge in the situation and dealing with my PC partner.<br/><br/>I regullarly was grooving on the setting+situation itself ( Right to Dream style) at other times. The game itself, outside of dice use, was pretty evocative and some sort of immersion was pretty easy to come by ( and sometimes downright damn creepy).<br/><br/>Knowing that at some level that the game would continue no matter what choices I made for my character was very liberating in terms of making moral choices in a decidely morally unclear environment. OTOH, this led straight back to other kinds of fun as well, tying me back to challenge and immersion.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is that while I loved the opportunities presented by the mechanics, at no time did I feel there was a strong, single group CA in effect, nor did I feel that I was moving towards one over the others.<br/><br/>Sorry if that's all clear as mud.

Nearly all roleplaying has all of the aesthetic content from all the recognized CAs in it. There are moments of challenge, moments of fidelity to (and celebration of / immersing in / discovering / whatever) the fiction, moments of human meaning. Always.<br/><br/>If it didn't strike you that the group was elevating part of that content as somehow being more important or necessary than the others, maybe it just would take longer for that group to develop a more definitive CA picture. Or maybe you were in fact coherent on the CA level, but your CA can't be precisely expressed by any of the recognized terms.

Or do we have to wait until we reflect upon what we intended to happen and what actually happened before "theme" becomes available to us? And to what extent are our intentions out of our awareness? And, to cap it all off, what about the fact that even in the absence of thematic intentions on our part, others can still read our play as addressing some sort of premise?</blockquote>\nInsofar as thematic play is narrativism, then it can certainly be seen as it happens. You notice how the players tense up and focus their attention on questions that have meaning, and react strongly to revelations that cast new meaning on already established events. It's definitely not a post-facto observation, even if theme itself is. "Addressing premise" in the technical sense is certainly a specific action that happens in a context, you can't just read that into any action afterwards. The player himself doesn't have to be aware that he is addressing premise, but he needs to be aware that the decision he is making is "important for the story". The fun in your bog-normal narrativist game actually derives from the fact that instead of going like authors and creating good story structures we get to focus on the moment and make momentarily satisfying decisions - the player advocates for his character instead of taking responsibility for creating a story, which is what makes narrativism fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214927/#Comment_214927" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T16:10:20+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  4:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nathanh</cite>I don't know if this is helpful or not, but here goes:<br/><br/>Perhaps GNS/CA is merely a hold over from gaming outpost or rfga that is only in the Big Model because of social reasons.

And, in the big model, don't, because it's not considered a competitor for "exploration time" with character and situation.<br/><br/>It's in your model that, if you concentrate for a time on theme, you don't concentrate on setting or charachters. I was simply noticing this logic consequences of considering theme an element of exploration.<br/><br/>It's even stranger than that: all the other elements of exploration can change, with time, only using the system.

Situation is the interaction of Character and Setting. Therefore, Theme is the moral relevance of the characters' actions in the setting. <br/><br/>One of the things that makes this tricky is the story-logic, rather than physics-logic or fairness-logic, that is used in many Story Now games. It all goes back to the Lumpley example of Babe the Pig - you know the little guy is going to win; the events of the film are fun because you care about how he gets there. <br/><br/>Not that Story Now can't do tragedy (duh ^_^), but it's the kind of thing where it's not the end of the world if it's a foregone conclusion. We derive different amounts of meaning based on our investment in something; if we are told by the protagonist (in a bit of time-hopping voiceover) that he is dead now, and relating the end of his life to us, then we are biting our nails waiting for the moment when BAM he dies. This shapes the whole emotional structure of the story around itself. On the other hand, a character who dies quite unexpectedly, or whose death becomes clearly imminent quite suddenly, must be "going somewhere with this" for us to appreciate it emotionally. A protagonist who dies suddenly, no explanation, had better be in some kind of Expressionistic life-is-meaningless piece, or we're going to feel jerked around. <br/><br/>These are the kinds of tools we need, and more, to do Story Now in a way that's satisfying. In no way does "story logic" leave behind Character and Setting; what else does it have?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214967/#Comment_214967" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T23:22:39+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 11:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: nathanh</cite>So instead of talking about creative agenda in terms of how it aligns things, you'd talk about the relation between the different elements of exploration</blockquote>\nDoesn't work. Theme is not part of exploration. I think you are simply confusing "theme" with "genre"<br/><br/>No, I mean theme.  As in the literary term.  Usually an abstract noun or a concept.  Often dealing with a question or morality or the particulars of the human condition.  You know, what the word means.  Theme most certainly is part of exploration.  "I want a game that's about what it means to be human in an society where replicants exist" is an example of that as much as "I want a game that's about how my character reacts to questions raised by the existence of replicants" is an example of exploration of character.<br/><br/>As for "doesn't work", "competitor for exploration time" and stuff like that, I would assume that we shouldn't expect the model to work the same way after the skewer has been pulled out.  Things would need to change.<br/><br/>Once that skewer is gone, the elements of exploration are no longer competitive for time, but complementary and supportive to one another.  There's a relationship between them and how techniques/ephemera can serve to accentuate one or more of them.  For example, you could have techniques concentrating on bringing in thematic decision making in play for the express purpose of exploring character.<br/><br/>In the big model, elements of exploration are seen as the means through which creative agenda is expressed.  The provisional glossary goes on to talk about three creative agendas that have so far been identified (G, N, S).  If we look instead at the actual expressions of the elements of exploration to identify aesthetic priorities, we come up with relationships and relative arrangements between the elements of exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215005/#Comment_215005" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T06:44:35+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  6:44AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nathanh</cite>Perhaps GNS/CA is merely a hold over from gaming outpost or rfga that is only in the Big Model because of social reasons.

It's not the only model or the only way of thinking about these things, so I've never understood why folks get so dogmatic about it, pro or con.  As part of that theory, CA describes a dynamic state that may well change in response to emergent events and behaviors in-play.  I've found both GNS and CA useful tools for examining player choices at the table, breaking down certain design choices, and looking more rigorously at my own choices in gaming.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my goal in perusing theory is to explore how to improve the quality of my play, both as player and GM.  Having followed the development of the Big Model, I don't feel a need to expound on it further; my focus has shifted from the abstract taxonomical frame to a more concrete analysis of at-the-table technique.  At some point, for any gaming-related theory to be useful, you (or rather I) have to find a way to translate its insights into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215179/#Comment_215179" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T18:32:56+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  6:32PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 7:42PM by frozenwastes.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I apologize if it's bad form, but I tend to work out my own thinking in conversation with other people and often state things emphatically as a means of examining them.  Moreno, thanks for your input-- I'm going to revisit a bunch of threads, posts and articles about creative agenda and the elements of the Big Model and give this some more thought.<br/><br/>My current thinking is that since aesthetic priorities are expressed through the elements of exploration, we should be able to use specific expressions of the elements of exploration and how they vary from other expressions to talk about aesthetic priorities rather than talking about it in three categories.<br/><br/>What it boils down to is that I think the big model presented in Ron Edward's <i>Narrativism: Story Now</i> is a better conception of it than the later ones which have CA as a skewer through everything. <br/><br/>The "current" Big Model<br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/The_Big_Model.svg/480px-The_Big_Model.svg.png"/><br/><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/The_Big_Model.svg/480px-The_Big_Model.svg.png" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/The_Big_Model.svg/480px-The_Big_Model.svg.png</a><br/><br/>From Narrativism: <i>Story Now</i> by Ron Edwards, 2003:<br/>[Social Contract [Exploration [Creative Agenda --&gt; [Techniques [Ephemera]]]]]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Creative Agenda</span> Aesthetic priorities become the expression of elements of exploration through specific techniques and ephemera during actual play.  Then if we want to compare and contrast play, disfunction, (in)coherency, we can talk about it as a specific arrangement/matrix of the elements of Exploration rather than trying to make everything fit into three nice little boxes which are largely the artifact of a social desire to fit old ideas into a new model so as to give validity to years of conversation and argument about those GDS/GNS/Threefold topics (which is to say that they might have been included because of their social and/or emotional weight).<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm thinking right about this and will explore it further, but that's where I currently am with this.  I'm starting to not be able to see what GNS offers in terms of talking about actual play that talking about the relationship between elements of exploration doesn't do more precisely.  I see Ron's essays of 2003 to be a point where he could have chosen to abandon the idea of trying to fit in GNS into the Big Model but did not and I'm interested in the utility of the possibilities of the path not taken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215192/#Comment_215192" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T19:33:12+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think that the idea of the skewer itself implies an almost infinite variety of agendas, seen as individual groups and games.

Thanks!  Here's a pertinent part:\n<blockquote><cite>From Eero's Blog</cite><br/>The first claim of the GNS theory (although one often interpreted as a necessary result of the Big Model in general as well) is that <b>such things as CA modes exist at all.</b> This is not obvious by any means \u2013 many critiques of the theory can basically be interpreted as attacking against this often implicit claim.</blockquote>\nThis is totally where I am.

What it does mean is: when you play a game, there is a moment when you start, and a moment where you say "what a great game! Let's play again!". Seeing CA is based on what is making you say that "let's play again", you have to consider everything between these two moments.<br/><br/>It's easier thinking about a specific game: for My Life with Master, for example, it's the time from master creation (included) to the epilogue, no matter how many game sessions you'll need to arrive there. In Dogs in the Vineyard, is bigger than a single city: it's the time between initial character creation and the final judgment of the players on their dogs (i.e., when they all give up the gun, or they all die, or they shoot each other, etc.)<br/><br/>It's usually bigger than a game session, as you can see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215300/#Comment_215300" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T08:01:14+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  8:01AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting viewpoint, Moreno.

I just don't think that it's the primary reward cycle for a real group of players - I find it unbelievable that it is. If it were, then individual sessions of the game would only be pleasurable and exciting as development towards that goal, but this is clearly not the case - the game is played as one-shots plenty enough, campaigns are left unfinished and in general people play the game in units of individual sessions, not campaigns. I get many more actual play reports about individual towns (and how awesome their stories were) than I get about complete cycles of individual dogs; I get the latter as well, but obviously not as many of them. Compare with traditional fantasy adventure rpgs, for which the reports <i>are</i> about long-term developments that take several sessions to play out; players expect such a campaign to only really <i>begin</i> around the third session or so.<br/><br/>This is totally a matter of individual experience, for all I know the people you play with genuinely consider the campaign cycle primary in the game and don't care that much about the individual stories of the individual towns. Just discussing my experience here. If you'd like, you can think of it this way: the game's town content "lures" us to play the game for long enough for the character arc to emerge, at which point we start caring about that more and more, so that in the end we have a solid story of an individual character instead of an unrelated set of town-stories. Which you consider more important is unimportant in the sense that they both are clearly rewarding, and in harmony with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9662/gns-isnt-that-important" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9662/gns-isnt-that-important" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9662/gns-isnt-that-important/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9662%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9662%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
