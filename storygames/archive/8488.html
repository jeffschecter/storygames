"why should i pay points to have an ally or a romantic interest if i could spend those points on a sweet magic sword instead?  after all, having an ally just creates a vulnerability - someone that could be attacked or kidnapped or betray me.  and besides, i'm just playing in the GMs story.  if i need to know an NPC, I'll know that NPC whether I like it or not."<br/><br/>i don't really like to do games this way any more, and i haven't, for awhile.  but i think this kind of thinking has become at least somewhat ingrained in my friends (and probably in me a little too).<br/>so the question is: what is the best solution if i want my friends to give their PCs Relationships and Connections but when left to their own devices, they don't?<br/>do i tell they they MUST do so, possibly (in games that use such systems) requiring that a certain number of their points be spent on them?  do i tell them they must but give them free points to do so?  the first seems that it could create resentment, while the second seems like it would result in NPCs that the player doesn't care about ("Oh, I just got him with my free points, so I don't really care what happens to him...").<br/><br/>possibly the best solution (or part of one of the above solutions) may be simply talking to my friends about this.  if i sit down with them and say, "Hey, I want to run this game, but I don't want to create a plotline on my own and shoehorn you into it, I want to create an interesting and dynamic situation, but to do that, I need you to help me by making up NPCs that your characters have some kind of Connection to."<br/><br/>hmm.  i'm not really sure what i'm looking for with this post.  i guess i'm just wondering if anyone else has struggled with this issue and how you resolved it.<br/>thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188195/#Comment_188195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T20:10:59+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  8:10PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2009 8:11PM by Josh Roby.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would advise a combination of your (2) and (1b) \u2014 sit down and talk with your friends, explaining that you want their character creation to also create the game's initial situation, and then give them dedicated points for creating those NPCs. If it were GURPS, for instance, I'd give them the 'usual' 125 points and then an additional 10 for Contacts/Allies/Dependents/etc.  Don't hand it down as a dictate; get them on board with the plan first, then enable them to contribute to the plan.<br/><br/>To kick it up a notch, have the players create one or two NPCs each, but then require each to figure a relationship to somebody else's NPC.  That way, you'll be that much closer to one big situation-relation map instead of five small ones, one for each PC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188196/#Comment_188196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T20:11:01+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  8:11PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've just hit upon my favourite style of playing and running games, for much the reasons you express. There are a few games that help people bridge the gap, games that have a bit of both. One of the best is Legend of the Five Rings (L5R).<br/><br/>L5R started out as a variation of the character design structure made popular by White Wolf, with people choosing clans. The clan is a good concept because it helps define the character (through stereotypes and special abilities) and also gives the character some connections within the gameworld.<br/><br/>As the background in L5R grew and was fleshed out more and more, other elements of the game gained significance until they, too, could function in similar ways. For example different spiritual outlooks could be used to make connections between the characters and factions within the game, as well as appearing as skills and other abilities on the character sheet. <br/><br/>The social structure of the game lends itself to a blended style of play, too. The characters are generally subservient to some lord who will send them on missions, but the intricate social network in the setting means that the connections are both a powerful resource and a source of conflict within that.<br/><br/>My one warning is that L5R is not a quick game. Because the background is so huge and intricate, and because all those connections encourage players to bring a lot of it in, it is much better for campaign games.<br/><br/>I still sometimes get players who can't get beyond wanting a hook in their mouth and a tug on the line, but I find that L5R has gotten a good few of them to stretch their legs a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188206/#Comment_188206" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T21:57:41+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  9:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Belonging to a "group" of some kind is all well and good, but it isn't really enough for me, Graham.  My moment to moment interests in games are quite fickle.  Recently I watched Kung Fu Panda and I thought to myself "I should try running Weapons of the Gods again!"  This lead me to think back to the first time I tried that out.  I ran the official demo/intro scenario and that was fun, then we did some character creation.  Both of my friends had characters that belonged to a a clan.  Maybe the same, maybe two different ones, I can't remember.  Neither, however, had any specific characters they were connected to beyond each other.  As in many games that I tend to put into the category of more "traditional" WotG (like REIGN, nWoD, heck even Burning Wheel) having individual NPCs as an official part of a character's life, whether as a friend, relative, lover, mentor, or even enemy, costs points that could otherwise be spent on things that have a more immediately obvious and tangible benefit.  and then, if you're approaching the game from a D&amp;Dish standpoint you say to yourself "Phhh.  Who needs that?"  <br/><br/>And yet it's both my belief and my experience that having an NPC that you find interesting and care about is one of the easiest and best ways to get a player interested and involved in the setting/situation as a whole.<br/>So the Green Mountain Bandits have been collecting and hoarding all the herbs gathered by the peasants living there and the mountain is the only place where the herbs used to treat a sickness that's been spreading through the low lands grows?  Who cares?  Not me.<br/>Oh, but my sister's fiancee has that sickness and is going to die without the medicine so she's disguised herself as a man to infiltrate the bandit clan?  Well, now I might care... but since you, mister GM just invented that sister on the spot, eh.  Whatever.<br/><br/>Does it make me a bad or lazy GM that I want my friends to at least work with me on coming up with this stuff?  if so, I don't care.  i'm pretty sure it would make the game better for everyone.<br/><br/>Josh - I... may consider doing that.  I think I like the idea of giving them free points for that purpose better than looking over their sheets when they're done and saying, "You didn't take any Relationships.  You have to take some Relationships.  Cuz I said so."  But I'm still worried that if the points they're spending on them are extra points it won't matter to them.  Something you get for free never means quite as much as something you had to pay for.  But that's probably still better than the possibility of them feeling resentful and forced into it.  Frankly, I'm hoping that after talking about it and talking about a potential setting/situation, they'll be as excited as I get about the idea of coming up with interesting NPCs that will end up in or causing difficult problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188209/#Comment_188209" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T23:20:27+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 11:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2009 11:21PM by Josh Roby.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>But I'm still worried that if the points they're spending on them are extra points it won't matter to them.</blockquote>\nSo go a step further.

I can see where it could be nasty.  I think it probably depends a lot of the individual players and the group and their preferred style of play.

I kind of feel like that's par for the course in a RPG too, but I also don't think it's unreasonable, as a player, to say "Hey, I've got this NPC on my sheet, but I'm not really at all interested in needing to rescue or save him or whatever.  That just wouldn't be fun for me."<br/>And of course, some games offer explicit ways to flag if you ARE interested in that kind of thing.  If you're supposed to write down Beliefs or Goals, or Passions, or something and one of them is something like "Protect my sister" it would be pretty weird if you later complained that your sister was always needing saving.<br/>Of course, fewer games (none?) have explicit ways to signal stuff you want left alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188326/#Comment_188326" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:21:04+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>That is a problem.

Stereotyping can be your friend: if you can pitch an NPC in one short sentence and everyone gets basically the same idea, that's perfect.  We love to see depth in NPCs, but we like to see it develop in play -- for the initial appearance, we really need to see a core concept that we can connect with immediately.<br/>2. Adding in one weird thing is good for color.  The loyal but dim legbreaking thug (stereotype) who dropped out of seminary school (one weird thing) gives you a fun quirk to play with to break up the monotony of the stereotype, and is one of the avenues that we can use to extract more depth later on.<br/>3. Always typecast whenever possible, especially if you're having players handle NPCs in some scenes: find out what character types people enjoy playing in short bursts, find out what character types they're good at playing in short bursts, and assign NPC roles accordingly.  Playing an NPC should be easy and fun whenever possible.  If one person is handling all the NPCs, you may need to exclude some types of NPCs or deal with them being portrayed poorly and/or infrequently.<br/>4. Recurring NPCs work best for us when they've got some kind of goal or desire: something that you can fall back on in a scene and say "okay, given that I want <i>this</i>, I'm going to do <i>that</i>."  It also gives the PCs reasons to talk about and think about NPCs even when they're not in a scene.<br/>5. Alternately (or at the same time) you can focus the NPC on a relationship: find out what a player wants out of a connection with a particular NPC (not what the PC wants, what the player wants!) and make that the baseline desire for playing that NPC.  "I want the captain to think I'm a loose cannon but a good cop: I want him to call me on my bullshit in private but back me up in public."<br/>6. Vet NPCs the same way you would a PC.  If something doesn't sound like it'll work out in play, put your heads together and fix it.<br/><br/>Our group's been great with 1 through 4, and we're working on hitting 5 and 6 more consistently.<br/>\n<blockquote>I mean, how many action/adventure movies do you see with a hero that has a love interest that never gets into trouble but just shows up to give deliver the hero's lunch and a peck on the cheek?

That just wouldn't be fun for me."</blockquote>\nExactly.  I don't object to connections being occasional vehicles for trouble, but it's starting to really bug me when that's <i>all</i> they are.  Some connections ought to involve some kind of positive factor, too.  Hell, in real life I've had friends who I've had to bail out of jail or help move or take care of when they're sick, but they've stepped up for me when I needed them, too.  And beyond that, we've got common interests, we enjoy being around each other, all that sort of thing; they don't just drift into my life when there's a crisis and then vanish until they have another crisis to lay on my doorstep.  I think it'd be awesome if the connections my PCs had could reliably operate that same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188344/#Comment_188344" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T15:00:02+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  3:00PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 3:02PM by MikeRM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The following is quite a departure from traditional playstyle, so it won't work for some trad groups.<br/><br/>My solution in my (in-progress) design, the Pentasystem, is to start out with a brainstorm in which people come up with what they want to see in the game - what themes and entities. Themes can be anything from 'racism' to 'airships' - anything that's not an entity and you want to see in game. Entities are mostly groups - the Church, the Government, Organized Crime.<br/><br/>Then you create NPCs (though I don't call them that, because they're played by players and there's no GM, but you can call them NPCs and have the GM play them if you want), which act as "faces" and "handles" to the themes and entities. If Organized Crime is an entity in the game, you get a hitter for the mob or a capo or whatever, depending on how many people were into that entity, and so forth.<br/><br/>Now you decide how the PCs are connected to those NPCs, because this is what involves them in what is going on with the themes and entities. The hitter for the mob is Danny's brother-in-law and he has a contract on Andy. In fact, you build your PCs in part around the NPCs, and not vice-versa. <br/><br/>I got this idea from an exercise I participated in here, which Josh Roby started, in which we found that if you started with the PCs they tended to be less interesting than the NPCs because they were produced with the smallest amount of information about the setting and situation.<br/><br/>Having wound up these springs, you now set your story machine going.<br/><br/>Oh, and [edit for crosspost], AFT's group has an excellent thing going there with giving the NPCs goals. That tells you what they're likely to do in a given situation and makes it easier to pass them over to people to play for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
