Is it possible to reduce encounter design and balance to something more versatile and reliable but fair?<br/><br/>I mean, the whole objective of the encounter balance procedure is to limit the DM budget in a way that she can present a fair challenge to the players given the level and amount of PCs. The procedure allows the DM to select between easy, medium, hard and deadly encounters and limits the amount of creatures and challenge she can present to the players for each encounter, making things fair. So far so good, I'm not really against this procedure, it works wonders and I get the point of it.<br/><br/>However, with the gameplay I'm used to, in practice the procedure takes so long that it can only be done at prep time and the results are as reliable as a weather forecast; it can either turn into a TPK of a boring rollfest. And this is taking into account all sorts of tricks like interesting terrain, enviromental hazards, monster strategy, combos, etc. <br/><br/>I mean, it's exactly things like these that make this part of game math so unreliable for me: the right amount of goblins vs the right amount of PCs of the right level that should become a fun medium encounter turns into a deadly one because some obstacles are added and a bit of strategy is used. A deadly encounter with a legion of lemures turns into a kinda boring rollfest since no one can even reach the PCs and it doesn't make sense for them to have an strategy.<br/><br/>There's more to each PC and creature than just their numbers. This is what ends up making the normal encounter balance procedure not too effective for my gameplay style. So I'm wondering if things can be done sort of, in reverse?<br/><br/>Like, what if I take note of the PCs stats and according to that I give proper stats to any monster I'd like to showcase/make up, ignoring the original ones in the MM?. For instance (I'm no mathematician, so feel free to correct me), if a player has a +5 to hit, she has 50/50 chances to hit anything above 16. Dial it down to 11 for easy, up to 20 for deadly, anything in between for medium and hard. <br/><br/>This is actually how the D&amp;D math already works, the only thing I'm eliminating here is<i> assuming</i> an X lvl PC will have enough bonuses to hit a CR Y monster, and instead looking at the PC actual bonus and decide "ok, then this monster will have this AC"<br/><br/>Dunno if it's clear enough, let me know if I can clarify this in any way. But if you think it is clear enough, does it sound too crazy? Considering all PC bonuses and stats, can balanced encounters be built easily? Do you think it would be more or less fair? What potential downfalls you foresee, is there any way to avoid them that doesn't include going back to the original procedure?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463387/#Comment_463387" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T19:06:35+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  7:06PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does your table enjoy about 5e?<br/><br/>I ask, because to me "just make the kobolds strong enough to be a challenge for my level" feels really really off for 5e. Like, I got my character to level 8, part of the reward is I'm just better than all the kobold riffraff now.<br/><br/>Sounds like the two big failure modes you're looking to avoid are<br/>* accidental deadly encounters<br/>* boring encounters<br/><br/>I'd implement two separate solutions for those. First, include a 3/4 or 4/3 multiplier to the CR of an encounter if the environment is super-good-for-PCs or super-bad-for-PCs, and do it again for monster strategy, so your lemur encounter's CR is half what it was, and your smart-goblins-in-a-fortress encounter's CR is 75% higher than it was. Second, if everyone can see it's boring, just cut to the end.<br/><br/>If those don't address what your solution is trying to address, clarify what your solution is trying to address more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463391/#Comment_463391" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:15:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:15PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you suggest could work, assuming the crunch landscape is generally simple - which is probably not a fair assumption in 5th edition. Given a simple enough interaction of various special powers and such, though, it would be possible to simply calculate appropriate stats for monsters from the PC stats. I think it's only theoretically feasible in the real situation (5th edition D&amp;D) here, though, and will fail in practice due to actual character effectiveness coming from a variety of complex sources rather than simple to-hit bonus and armor class.<br/><br/>More generally, your problem is fundamental to modern D&amp;D. I personally ultimately resolved it by refusing to take the responsibility: let the GM merely tell the players that there is a hydra here, and let the party bard or whoever fish up a stat block, and let the players decide if they can "take it". Much easier (and crucially, more interesting) than for the GM to take responsibility for the encounters fairness (or worse yet, encounter outcomes). The balancing thing didn't work in 3rd or 4th edition, so I would be surprised if it works in 5th either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463392/#Comment_463392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:38:01+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2017 8:43PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed. As Eero says, the question here is somewhat philosophical. Is your intentation to remove all "unbalanced" fights/encounters from the game? If so, what are you willing to sacrifice in order to make that happen?<br/><br/>For instance, your suggested solution - if a functional version could be made (I'm not 100% sure it could):<br/><br/>* Devalues player decisions, tactics, and strategy. If they are clever in positioning or strategy, shouldn't they benefit from that? If they make mistakes or play foolishly, shouldn't they suffer from that?<br/><br/>It's not an obvious question!<br/><br/>* Devalues character builds, magical items, and abilities. Do I just keep increasing monster hit points when one of the characters finds a really powerful weapon? Do I give the enemies better to-hit bonuses when so-and-so gets magical armour?<br/><br/>If so, what's the point of getting better weapons and armour?<br/><br/>* May create problems if character become "unbalanced" - do I adjust the monsters' AC so that the Fighter finds it hard to hit them? If so, then what happens to the poor magic-user, who can't hit them at all?<br/><br/>The <b>standard D&amp;D answer</b> seems to be to populate a world (or dungeon) with a variety of monsters, and then allow the players to fight different monsters as appropriate to their abilities and power level. <br/><br/>That seems to me to be the most sensible and robust way of engaging the system, and it's the sort of D&amp;D I would prefer. I don't *want* all my encounters to be predictably "balanced" - the fun is seeing how the players deal with varying levels of challenge, and how that creates a variety of situations in play.<br/><br/>What else can you do?<br/><br/>I suppose you could create a tier system, instead of D&amp;D's escalating bonuses and numbers: when you fight something below your level, you get better odds of success, and when you fight something above your level, you suffer penalties.<br/><br/>That would allow you to create a game where you can create an "optimal" set of stats for enemy monsters, for balance. Now, the player characters never advance their abilities at all - instead, their scale/level increases, allowing them to take on harder monsters despite their unchanging stats. All encounters can now be "balanced", but at the cost of unchanging stats/numbers/bonuses. Instead, the "colour" changes - you reskin the monsters with each "advance" or "level up".<br/><br/>If you were going to create a "balanced" game, that would seem to me to be a better way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463393/#Comment_463393" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:41:56+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:41PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note that:<br/><br/>Games which do not use enemy "stats" at all (like Apocalypse World's moves/rolls) allow you to maintain perfect "balance", if that's your goal: the players are always rolling against the characters' stats, instead of against monster stats.<br/><br/>Another idea:<br/><br/>You could create a system for creating mostly balanced encounters, so long as you're willing to have the occasional "easy" or "hard" encounter.<br/><br/>The way it would work would be to pick a standard encounter level you feel pretty comfortable with, and keep it.

Overall we enjoy somewhat short encounters; we've never gone beyond 10 rounds. Most usually things will end by the 5th to 7th round. Next, if the same deal (monster tactics, player attacks, combat results) goes for more than 3 rounds, it's hard not to perceive things as repetitive for everyone.<br/><br/>Now, my intention isn't to make kobolds strong for every level, that just doesn't make sense, we're all aboard the lvel-up boat, otherwise we would just make 5th lvl characters and scale everything to that level accordingly. That's not my intention.<br/><br/>My problem is however, not how to come up with cool encounters for my group. It's not that I can't take any low or medium level monster and reskin it to suit my campaign. My problem is to find out which combination of monsters in the book both make for a challenging encounter but for a fair one too. I do see that most monsters in the book make for poor encounters if used alone and without strategy. They have but two or three special skills for one reason, you need to mix these and be creative about their use to make a good encounter.<br/><br/>The thing is that I feel you need to make an important research effort to find out which monsters to use, reskin them if you must and then probably then still play a bit with the stats. Also, I hate it that by the time the PCs are finally in front of X monster, it turns out to be a big dissapointment because their stats are now way above the challenge. And god forbids if I want to make a completely new original creature, it will certainly break the game! And in the worst case, it ends up with kinda sad tricks like wrapping it early, interrupting the combat with an event I either improvise or had prep, bringing an npc to the rescue or another illusionistic stuff. I have used them a lot in the past, still use them from time to time but I'm trying to stay away from them for the time being.<br/><br/>Right now if I go by the book and naturally spice up the encounter, I end up with something deadly, or at least something that I don't know exactly if it would be too much or too little. If I don't spice up the encounter, it's kinda plain. Perhaps it's just that I'm way too used to come up with interesting encounter ideas that I end up feeling that the book is limiting my creativity. I'd like to use monsters with a few more tricks than a bite or a claw attack, but when I finally find one in the book is either way above the reccommended CR or way below it, or (this is it's an example, not an actual issue) it's, say, an aquatic one and now I have to come up with a way not only to put it into the desert (reskin it as a sand creature wouldn't be difficult) but also a believable backstory to introduce it to the campaign. It's kinda frustrating, I'd just like to be able to come up with anything I'd like, see the players stats and say "all right, this is meant to be a medium encounter so it's gonna need this AC, this to hit, this amount of HP to last at least 4 rounds and this DC for it's tricks". And if I could do it in the middle of the session, that would be perfect.<br/><br/>I somehow still think I can pull it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463399/#Comment_463399" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T21:10:49+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  9:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A key point, though:<br/><br/>The more you look for "encounter balance", the LESS fictional positioning, strategy, and smarts can matter.<br/><br/>If you want to increase balance, you need to diminish the value and impact of those things on the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463400/#Comment_463400" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T21:32:21+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  9:32PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An observation about the encounter-spicing: my experience is that GMs generally feel much more pressure to be original than is warranted by the player experience. In the D&amp;D context, it seems that players are generally quite happy with what the GM may consider to be normal, boring, by-the-book content; it's not by-the-book from their viewpoint, because they're not the ones with the book. I have experienced this on the both sides of the table.<br/><br/>This being the case, I personally find it very sensible in most rpg situations to sacrifice GM creativity to gain some other virtue. In this case it seems that you're saying that you could achieve your desired amount of game balance by simply being less ambitious with the "personal touch" and sticking closer to the content the books offer. Because I do not believe that the players really value your personal touch, it is easy for me to recommend that you just drop it and let the game speak for itself.<br/><br/>Of course that personal creative touch is often a big thing in the GM being interested in the game at all. After all, at a certain point of creative constraint the GM just becomes a big, fat computer replacement. The solution to that, I've found, may be to let the most boring player at the table do the GMing, freeing the GM to kibbitz with the other players from the other side of the screen while the pedant does the numbers [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463402/#Comment_463402" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T21:56:26+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  9:56PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The solution to that, I've found, may be to let the most boring player at the table do the GMing, freeing the GM to kibbitz with the other players from the other side of the screen while the pedant does the numbers [grin].</p></div></blockquote>\nHa! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>May I venture to guess that thus was Iron Thomas the Locomotive brought into being?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463404/#Comment_463404" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T22:10:28+00:00" title="May 16, 2017 10:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh no; Tuomas (the GM of the said game) is far from a boring player, and my GMing that game was never an option in the first place - I had then as little motivation for running 5th ed. as I have now.<br/><br/>The Call of Cthulhu campaign I'm in right now is somewhat like this, though - the GM is not nearly the most creative and vocal player at the table.

I'm okay to leave the problem to the players to find a solution. Problem is that in my gameplay, players assume that whatever I'm presenting to them, there's got to be a solution linked to their own stat blocks, otherwise the game stops feeling fair.

Now, the player characters never advance their abilities at all - instead, their scale/level increases, allowing them to take on harder monsters despite their unchanging stats. All encounters can now be "balanced", but at the cost of unchanging stats/numbers/bonuses.

In 5e these are summed into advantage and disadvantage, while cover gives either a +2, +5 to AC or no chance to attack directly in the case of full cover. 3.5 had a ton of small bonuses for each case but with some practice GMs could usually wing it instead of searching for the exact rule. So, we could like, say we're moving up this monsters proficience because it has more combat experience, and balance things up a bit. <br/><br/>We could roll their HP in the open adding a couple more of its hit dice for the same reason, and now we have a sort of upgraded version of it. All I've got to do to keep it "balanced" is checking that players have a reasonable margin of hitting it.<br/><br/>It doesn't mean there aren't encounters where players best option is to run. They have run before from several encounters and still find them fun. The thing is, the encounters that managed to do this were mostly heavily reskinned monsters.<br/><br/>I took a banshee, took away it's wail attack, then presented it to the players as an skeleton in armour, able to command a bunch of common skeletons. I saved it's incorporeal ability for when it was low on HP and needed to run. Players did got a hold of magical weapons but since they couldn't identify them, they refused to use them. They could have killed the banshee with one of those when she went incorporeal, but they chose to run. It was a magnificent exciting combat, with barely two twists (one when it went incorporeal and the other was because some player mistakes) but interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>Another good one featured a golem reskinned as a mechanical war golem with a couple tricks. It had a small firethrower that turned the ground on a hazardous terrain wherever the golem moved, enough strenght to pick up big objects the PCs were using as cover and throw them against them, an ice ray and some electrical discharges whenever somebody tried to jump over him. I had learned my lesson by then and reduced the damage of each to 1 or 2d6 top. The machine tried to escape in the end by igniting its thrusters but the players shoot it down. I'd say that half of it was added during combat and illusionistic as that was it turned out to be one hell of an encounter.<br/><br/>Simple stuff is all right too. Like a dungeon with a corridor half filled with murky water and piranhas. Three sharks on a lake at night. Sometimes most of it is just the descriptions instead of the actual things the monster can do. Like, I knew the piranhas wouldn't kill the barbarian but surprisingly he went ans wasted a rage to get out of there.<br/><br/>Well, thing is, I'm much better at impro than at crunching numbers. So having a bunch of somewhat solid stat blocks that I'd bump up and down and insert some cool tactics into may actually do the trick for my gamestyle.<br/><br/>Hmmm what about this:<br/><br/>-I write down all pertinent PC stats. <br/>-Determine the range of monster stats I could have with it.<br/>-Have 3 settings of difficulty:<br/>A) players describe how they beat the crap out of these minions<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> battle ensues<br/>C) Run or die<br/>-players get warned what difficulty will this be before the encounter<br/><br/>If battle ensues, some DCs or AC could be high, some low, but most would be still in the PCs reach numerically. I can adjust which ones either in prep or even in the session if I have to. I could even ensure a bit more of fairness by using a random table for monster stats and tactics.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463408/#Comment_463408" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T23:50:23+00:00" title="May 16, 2017 11:50PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would systematic fudging on the fly work for your group and style? Like, keep the monster stats secret and reveal them only as you go, which implies that e.g. monster HP never needs to be revealed before the monster goes down, and monster morale just happens to break just when it might get iffy otherwise. Of course it just so happens that the monsters go down when they need to; they can be a bit tougher or weaker as needed, in real-time.<br/><br/>Take that plus a crisis plan or two (like, introduce a storyline that justifies mysterious divine interventions "three times before the judgment comes", and then use those to save the party if you mess up and send them against something too hard; you get a cool side plot as a bonus if you ever are forced to save them three times, too), and you should be able to keep going for a long time even with the strictly-theoretically-useful encounter balancing system.<br/><br/>The reason this sort of thing tends to work for most fantasy adventure gaming groups is that "I experienced exciting things in the game session" is perhaps the single most common, most powerful player value in roleplaying; if you recreate your own position as the "bringer of fun" (as opposed to "functionary of the rules"), the odds are that the other players will be entirely happy. They'll get their excitement, probably much better than if you tried too hard to balance things; after all, you'll be able to run the game on <i>overdrive</i>, essentially, when you have fudge factors on your side. They'll get to slay dragons or whatever, and it won't end in tears.<br/><br/>I'll note even if this suggestion works short-term, it's IMO a bad long-term solution because of the incidious effects it has on player expectations; you basically can't go long-term illusionist without infantilizing the players as participants, is my experience. But if you're just looking for a temporary fix to get the campaign over with, so as to build something new on a more solid base, then that might be the smart thing to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463409/#Comment_463409" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T02:57:26+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  2:57AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreeing with Eero.<br/><br/>If the "Rule Zero GM Magic" is working for you, maybe you should just stick with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463415/#Comment_463415" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T15:40:37+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  3:40PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2017 3:47PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope, exactly because Eero is right is that I'm striving to make this fix. It's true, too much fudging and you're invalidating player options and infantilizing the players. The thing I'm aiming for is more about making the game more efficient in terms of what is the best thing it's meant to produce. I did made another design to take care of this along other things, so I know it's possible. I know I'm stuck with some things that belong to a different kind of fun that the one I'm used to and I'm trying to embrace a bit of that too. But also I realize that for many of these things I just have to change my point of view a bit and I can get good fun from them too.<br/><br/>For example, for years I narrated a player's failed roll as "you miss". Those were turns where nothing happened, no twist, nothing the player had done gave any results and no story was produced by the roll. And then there was this somewhat toxic gameplay of narrating fails and botches making fun of the PC, that all of the GMs I played with used all the time. I ended up using it too, as there was usually nothing else good to narrate there, and I would also make fun of the NPCs when I rolled low or a botch. Humor is also good fun in my table, even if it ruins a bit any other atmosphere I'm aiming to.<br/><br/>But then I readed some PbtA and some good advice here in SG and realized those were the perfect moments to narrate the NPCs doing something cool, unexpected or lucky. I didn't had to wait until I rolled a 20 to narrate how terrifying the evil guys were, I could narrate it whenever the players rolled low. Now everytime they miss I instead narrate: "You could have swear that was a sure shot, but in the last instant the orc feels your killing intent and manages to move a bit. Your arrow glances on his pauldron and now you feel his killing intent focusing on you"<br/><br/>Going back to less fudgy things I do, new ones I can do and fudgy things I end up doing in the worst case:<br/><br/>-I can roll hit dice on the open the first time a creature is hit and let players make HP bookkeeping. (I heard that's the fair way to go)<br/>-I can be open about monster moral, my rule of thumb is that if it's not cornered nor insane, it will try to run when it's down to half HP or less. (are rolls for moral more fair than this? I could go for those, np)<br/>-Tactics and stats I can prep, I just hate to use the encounter balance procedure even with online calculators. (I end up fudging whenever I use it) <br/>-Knowing PCs HP, any GM can tell if 8d6 of electric damage is too much or too little. If it's too much, I can still have a watered down NPC sorcerer casting a 4d6 lightning bolt. (I don't think this is invalidating player choices, specially if they didn't know which spells the sorcerer has on its list, nor what's the rule on that spell. Do you think it's still too fudgy?)<br/>-I can come up with some stats right before the fight and stick to it. I can come up with some stats when needed and stick to it. If anything has been stated before, we stick to it and follow the consequences. (There are a lot of threads about relativism of this fudginess, but let's say it's fudgy and leave it at that)<br/>-I can inform the players if the fight is obviously easy or way above their CR before it starts. (it makes their decisions count, I suppose it's fair)<br/>-I can inform the players of possible consequences they haven't foreseen because my narration can be at fault. (uninformed player decisions aren't fair in my book)<br/>-If a mountain goat is specially trained and/or it makes sense it has supernatural abilities, I don't consider reskining, say, a manticore and watering down it's stats as unfair. (It's, you know, reskinning. It's meant to me creative, surprise the players. otherwise a single mountain goat can't give 5 level 3 players too much of a challenge)<br/>-I use a maximum of three tricks per encounter, between things like a creature's special ability, good tactics, item use, traps, etc. I may have more prepared though since most can be quite situational, or even improvise one on the worst case, if the combat is on it's 3rd turn and nothing else is going on. (a fudgy but calculated risk: if players can deal with it, are still at top of their HP, won't suffer more than 1d6 damage and it scares them a little, then this last fudge paid for a whole uninteresting encounter)<br/>-I keep mountain witching the players for their input, using everything on their character sheets as flags for my prep, asking them where they want to go and prep for that, stealing their ideas and throwing away my prep if those are better. This is as far away from railroading as I can get. I love it too when I don't know where are things going as a GM <br/><br/>Okay, writing it down helped a lot to put things in perspective for me. There is and will be this much of Zero Rule in my game for now, I know I can't make things entirely fair without playing a different game. I just want to add some fair things and be a bit more open here and there. Perhaps I'll manage to be entirely fair with another game or another version of D&amp;D, or maybe with 5e once I figure out better ways to manage things and find other points of view. Sorry for the fuzz and thanks a lot everyone, it's certainly been enlightening so far. Feel free to keep making suggestions or point me to other posts where you have written/seen other fair stuff, I'll stay tuned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463687/#Comment_463687" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T02:12:51+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  2:12AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the necro, but I've been gone awhile.<br/><br/>WM, you really, really, really don't want 5E, you want 4E. Its encounter building and monster math is much more transparent, and you'll pretty much never have the kind of accidental TPK or whiff-fest you're worried about. 5E is inherently kinda swingy.<br/><br/>You\u2014all of you in this thread, AFAICT\u2014also have no idea how the math of 5E works. You talk about irrelevancies, like whether the PCs will have a decent chance of hitting a particular monster. There are monsters in the high teens in CR that have ACs of 15 or 16. Bounded accuracy, remember?<br/><br/>In fact, the biggest fallacy here is the idea that if a monster's CR is "too low" you can't throw it at the party. That's also nonsense, precisely because of bounded accuracy. If a monster has a low CR, but has the exact ability you want, use it anyway, just use more of it. Not too much more, though: Goblins are 50 XP, right? Let's say you have 4 5th-level PCs. A dozen goblins is 50 x 12 = 600 XP, right? No, because the table on the bottom right of page 82 of the DMG says to multiply that number by 3 for their numerical advantage. Suddenly, although still only worth 600 XP (if you're using the book's XP system), they are as difficult as an 1,800 XP encounter with fewer monsters would be. That's only just shy of Medium for our hypothetical 5th-level party! (Even easier way to build encounters: choose a single tougher monster. Don't worry about the CR too much, as long as it's not more than 1 higher than the PCs, but make sure it has a decent amount of HP. Then given it a number of mook type minions equal in number to the PCs plus 2.)<br/><br/>Because the other thing you have to understand is that difficulty in 5E isn't really supposed to be about any single encounter. It's about endurance. It's about the Adventuring Day. You see, the DMG isn't kidding that the system is designed around a long rest only every 6-8 encounters. (And short rests every 2-3 encounters.) Many, many people totally miss this aspect of the system, and try to run exciting adventures with only 1-2 combats per long rest... and then wonder why there was an accidental TPK!<br/><br/>But I enforce that expectation fairly strictly, and it's why if there's a fight where the PCs only take, like 5 damage on average apiece before slaughtering all the monsters, that's fine... because those HP won't heal themselves. Or, if they kill all the monsters before taking a single point of damage... but only did so by blowing an important spell or two? Fine!<br/><br/>5E works best as a tactical and strategic exercise, just as much as any old-school game. But it doesn't care about light sources, food, or water. The resources you have to manage are Hit Dice, spell slots, and other expendable character abilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463689/#Comment_463689" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T12:48:33+00:00" title="June  4, 2017 12:48PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Matt!

CR is the less reliable indicator of how deadly a monster could be, even the manuals tell you so. It's good as a reference, but otherwise that's it. On higher levels monsters with lower AC either have more HP that works better as a defense than just having a high AC, or are expected to work with other monsters. Can't really talk about 4e, never played it and everything I readed and saw about it didn't really clicked for me.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you're right, 5e is a tactical game, if you don't GM nor play it that way you're wasting a fine selection of rules and mechanics geared towards that. Care too much about precise balance to held up storytelling achievements and narrative character progress and you will feel that rules are in your way instead of helping you. I re-readed the first page of the PHB the other day and now it feels like half "ok, I know where this is coming from" and half bullshit. <br/><br/>You can "play D&amp;D" for the story and be the GM that fudges dice, encourages roleplaying and uses the ol' zero rule a lot, but then you won't be <i>playing</i> D&amp;D. You will be playing a freeform story game roughly based on D&amp;D rules. Which is okay, it can work, it worked for years as it seems it worked for the guy who wrote that introduction to the game, but then you have no right about complaining that "the rules don't work".<br/><br/>Lessons learned so far:<br/><br/>-Solitaire monsters are not recommended for a good encounter. At least it would be good to pair them with an enviromental danger or obstacle course for the PCs to run through.<br/>-Different monsters with different synergic abilities make for more interesting encounters. Otherwise, give the monsters a couple tactics or a single use item they can change the tide of the battle with.<br/>-Encounter calculators online work quite fine for monsters. Monsters are absolutely not a problem now for me. NPCs with classes are.<br/>-Spellcaster NPCs should never battle without cannon fooder around. There are too few things for them to do with their bonus actions and damage spells will often be too much  for a single PC.<br/>-As a GM, whenever your monster's or NPCs HP and/or numbers fall to 1/2, start retreating, unless the monsters/NPCs are unable to reason. It's believable and makes for a good change of pace admist the battle.<br/>-A battle where the tides don't change works as a preparation for a really good battle, but not as a replacement.<br/>-When PCs reach 0 HP, they just fall unconscious and will roll their death saves each round. That puts TPKs further than I was used to think, but requires the GM to be creative about what happens when they wake up. Story can go on, it doesn't have to end in a single combat for the same PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463707/#Comment_463707" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T04:29:47+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  4:29AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've played 4th edition about five times over the years.

I seem to remember that the party didn't survive past the first encounter in that session. I remember having the understanding that the GM set things up by the book, but I suppose he could have made some sort of an error in encounter balancing.<br/><br/>I don't know why the game has produced these sorts of results for me. The only even remotely credible explanations are that we're the only people in the world who don't fudge the dice rolls to keep the party alive, or that we're just so bad at playing the game, or that it's a bad idea to use introductory adventure modules for the game. It is notable that many of the people who've been with me in these various try-outs have since played long campaigns of 4th edition successfully; it's not anybody's favourite game that I know of, but evidently they've gotten over whatever it is that's always killed us when I've played [grin].<br/><br/>I like the general establishment of 4th edition as a video-gamey skirmish wargame myself, and doing something ambitious with it is something I've been speculating about for a long time. I'll be sure to revamp the campaign structures of the game when I do, though, to address these sorts of problems - the game either needs to revel in pointless PC death or prevent it, rather than remain in this this awkward ditch where it's technically possible, supposedly prevented by encounter balancing, but when it nevertheless happens for some reason it's unfun and crashes the game. It's not dissimilar to Warrior Monk's 5th edition woes, I imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463712/#Comment_463712" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T15:41:50+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  3:41PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure it's possible for a standard 4e party/encounter setup to result in a TPK on the first encounter without either<br/><br/>a) getting some rule(s) catastrophically wrong, or<br/>b) most people at the table noticing hilariously unlucky dice rolls, or<br/>c) players forgetting they have daily powers and action points? nah that wouldn't be enough                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463713/#Comment_463713" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T15:56:02+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  3:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't say, really - I didn't document the experience at the time.

On average these novel-end-condition encounters were <i>less straight-up balanced</i> but had a kind of dynamic equilibrium I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>The other interesting thing we did (again during 4e days) was set up a global clock tied to long rests. There was an invasion or something that was going to happen and several mitigations (reinforcements from allies was one) that we could put points into by succeeding at various themed encounters... so go ahead and take as many long rests as you want, the invasion clock will advance each time and you won't be making any progress toward mitigations. <br/><br/>The way this made balancing easier is that the encounters could be made easier, less chance of TPK, and the focus becomes players maximizing ratio of encounters defeated to long rests taken.

Even if you're saving the world, you gotta rest sometime, but you don't need to take a day off necessarily.<br/><br/>The medium rest is honestly super great--it was kind of an off the cuff idea, but it's ended up being amazing in my current campaign. It gives back 1 HD, 1 spell slot of highest level available (which can be split up among lower-level slots if needed), 1 level of fatigue, and all the benefits of a short rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
