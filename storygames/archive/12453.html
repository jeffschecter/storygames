So I stepped out from behind a building and joined the recruits, figuring that nobody would notice one more.  Out of character, I randomly joined a tour group of perspective students and began walking with them into one of the campus buildings.<br/><br/>Once in the building, I spotted two other players who I also knew were in the game, so I gravitated towards them, let them finish out the scene that they were playing and then the three of us set up a scene with me infiltrating the warlord's recruitment and processing center.  I was infiltrating the center to break out this older, somewhat befuddled man who I had a strong relationship with (a father figure of some kind), but the two of us eventually sat down with the warlord's right hand man in a small room with one table.  The other players took on the roles of the older guy and the warlord's lieutenant, even though those probably weren't the characters they had been playing before.  They were just cameoing as NPCs in my scene.<br/><br/>As we played through the scene, the lieutenant got more and more suspicious about the two of us, and eventually started asking questions about George Wells (lame name, but that's what he was called in the scene), the Patient Zero of a new and bizarre man-made virus that was spreading throughout the population.  The befuddled guy nodded his head, showing that he knew about George Wells, which by itself was enough to let the lieutenant know that we were not just innocent recruits.  Before the lieutenant can yell out for the warlord or his soldiers, I (out of character), reach into my pocket and pull out a deck of cards.  I draw a few against the player playing the lieutenant and win, so I narrate my player grabbing the lieutenant in a headlock and holding him hostage as I make the way out of the building with the older guy stumbling along.  We don't actually larp that part out because it would alarm all the folks not playing and I'm about to go solo again and leave these other two players to their own PCs and plots. Potentially I could have stayed with them for a bit longer and served as an NPC in one of their scenes, but it seemed like the point of the game was to keep things moving and not be bogged down in the same area with the same players for more than a couple scenes.<br/><br/>So I head down into the basement of the building -- which is like the student center -- without the other players, looking for another way out.  I end up busting out through a custodian's door and heading for the treeline on the edge of campus.  Once I'm out there, totally alone, I imagine myself and the older man sneaking our way along, trying to avoid the attentions of the warlord's patrols, as I begin walking towards another location which, like the building that was the "recruitment center," is marked in the game as a significant place that you would expect other players to pass through and conduct scenes in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279680/#Comment_279680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T09:44:06+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  9:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of a LARP where the people you bump into turn into impromptu GM and NPC for a brief tabletop interlude, perhaps not even related to them. Everyone does everything. This is probably not hugely different from some LARP tradition, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279816/#Comment_279816" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:07:44+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:07AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279818/#Comment_279818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:09:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:09AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, ++ for games coming to you in dreams.
