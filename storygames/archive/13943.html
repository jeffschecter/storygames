When I was a sophomore in high school\u2014holy moly! 30 years ago!\u2014my brother and I would head over on Saturday mornings to our slightly older friend Adam\u2019s house to play wargames from Avalon Hill and SPI on the pool table down in his basement. Eventually, Adam introduced us to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and, man, we were hooked.  Now, we did stop playing with Adam after some egregiously poor sportsmanship on his part\u2014the old \u201cmy guy mistook yours for a bad guy, so I killed you and took your stuff\u201d trick\u2014but the game went on until we all went away to college.<br/><br/>So it delights me now to be able to run a Saturday morning D&amp;D game that includes the middle-school age sons of some of my friends. Fourth Edition works particularly well for that purpose, because it allows an emphasis on toy-like tactile elements\u2014I have maps and miniatures (some of them 30 years old, and purchased at a hobby shop in New Jersey that just shut it doors a year or two ago\u2014oh, the nostalgia, it\u2019s heart-wrenching) that \u201cadd interest\u201d to the game, particularly for the primary-grade age kid brothers of my target audience\u2014and it is relatively low-prep.<br/><br/>For example, the last time we played, we picked up right after the heroes had completed their raid on the Caves of Chaos and escaped with the Chaos Gem. In the fiction, the Caves of Chaos were hard by the Wilderness of Bahamut, a peaceful land of eternal summer ruled over by a beneficient dragon lord. That meant it was easy to imagine the characters winding up in a little port town on the Sea of Fools, looking to rest, refit, and cash in some of the treasure they\u2019d acquired in the Caves. <br/><br/>Now, I knew that the player whose character held the Chaos Gem wouldn\u2019t be there. So my prep for that next session amounted to picking a suitable village map and deciding that in addition to the normal shopkeepers and craftsmen there would be (1) a fortune-teller, (2) a rumor-monger, and (3) a drake peddler.  Fortune teller I came up with to connect the fiction to the Deck of Many Things that gets used at the meta-game level, as I\u2019ve previously discussed; a \u201crumor-monger\u201d is something I stole from Robert Heinlein\u2019s [i]Glory Road[/i] for my long-ago high school AD&amp;D campaign and decided to import once again; in this world, it\u2019s a cut-rate combination sage and slanderer. And the drake peddler I came up with while paging through the 4E Monster Manual the night before the game; it turns out that there are dragon-like animals called \u201cdrakes\u201d in the D&amp;D world that get used for pets and watch beasts. Now, I didn\u2019t do any work to stat out these NPCs or even realize them as characters; I just said to myself (and eventually to the players), \u201cOkay, there\u2019s a fortune-teller, a rumor-monger, and a drake peddler in this little port town.\u201d<br/><br/>I did one other thing, in response to my observation in play that monster hit points were too high. After considering simply quartering hp, I decided that the formula for a creature\u2019s hit points would be (4.5 + Con bonus / 2) * Level. So a first-level monster with a Con of 15 (bonus +2) gets 6 hp, while a fifth-level critter with a Con of 20 (+5 bonus) gets [(4.5+2.5)*5 =] 35. Monsters wind up with somewhere between one-quarter and three-quarters of the hit points they\u2019d normally have with the RAW. The effect of this is to make fights go faster, which is useful when you only have two hours in which to run a session.<br/><br/>And that was all the prep needed. I laid the village map out on the table, put the special shopkeepers I\u2019d devised on the map (w/character tokens), and set up the scene for the players. I told them that since they were now \u201cin town,\u201d they had a chance to divvy up the loot they\u2019d acquired and otherwise tend to their affairs.<br/><br/>After a bit of business involving trying to open a locked metal box (loot from the Caves) with a poison needle trap guarding its 200 gold pieces (the rogues blew their Thievery rolls, but the fighter made his), 11-year-old Tom headed straight for the drake peddler, who would be more than happy to sell him four well-trained guard drakes at 50 gp each\u2014what? just one? and you want to bargain with the drake peddler? All right, roll Diplomacy\u2014success! \u2018Here\u2019s your guard drake for 40 gp, and I\u2019m cutting my own throat at the price.\u2019 Young Tom was very pleased with his own guard drake, who in lieu of its unpronounceable name in Call Me Joe\u2019s native tongue became Call It Fred.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, my grown-up friend Jay, playing Fin Fang the wizard, headed for the fortune teller to see if she could identify the runes on the staff he\u2019d found in the Caves of Chaos. She could indeed\u2014those were fire runes, and that was a Staff of Fiery Might he was carrying; Jay was pleased with all the funky stuff it could do. And if he crossed her palm with more silver, she\u2019d read Fin Fang\u2019s fortune for him. The cards were the Flames (Bane, God of War) and the Fool (Melora, the Wild Queen), presaging violence and a journey by water.<br/><br/>Jay\u2019s son and Tom\u2019s classmate Max went back to the drake peddler to see if he could buy any magic items to make the guard drake more ferocious; the drake peddler showed him three jeweled collars he could pick up: one that gave it a savage bite, one that increased its running speed, and another that raised its alertness. But the price for each one was 300 gp, and that was too steep for their blood.<br/><br/>Sensing that I was going to need to move the action forward quickly, I began to set up for a fight\u2014it was going to be a send-in-the-ninjas moment soon.  Coming out of a tavern, Fin Fang came face-to-face with a bunch of ugly looking sailors carrying clubs. Everyone else was scattered over the village map, which depicted a bunch of thatch-roofed buildings around a central square with a little pool or spring in the middle. Maybe an old Dungeon Magazine insert?<br/><br/>Wait, said Jack (Max\u2019s kid brother, the third grader). What about the thing I want to do? -Right, right, right, I said, you\u2019re doing it now. What was it again? -I want to use my Piercing Strike to pierce the ground and see if treasure comes out.  <br/><br/><i>I want to use my Piercing Strike to pierce the ground and see if treasure comes out.</i> Sure, it sounds silly, but think about what has to be going on in that boy\u2019s head for that to make sense. First, he\u2019s trying to use his character sheet as the instrument through which he interacts with the game-world, which is a pretty reasonable cognitive strategy. Second, he\u2019s orienting toward what\u2019s going on in the fiction, which is that the characters are assessing their loot. Well, he didn\u2019t get any loot\u2014no one gave him any\u2014so he\u2019s just doing the best he can. It\u2019s adorable, really. And in any event, my DMing policy, especially with the youngest boys at the table, is to never shoot down what they\u2019re doing at the meta-level, but instead to let them try whatever they propose and see what happens. The worst thing that happens is that their effort simply fails.<br/><br/>So I say to Jack: Okay, you start doing that. There you are in the middle of the square, stabbing the ground with your dagger. Somebody comes up to you and says, \u2018Son, [i]what[/i] are you doing?\u2019 Jack explains that he\u2019s looking for treasure. \u2018If it\u2019s treasure you want, I have a map right here! I\u2019ll sell it to you! Enormous treasure, right here on the map.\u2019 With no actual gold on him, and with his dad telling him that he wasn\u2019t allowed to attack the man and take the map, Jack gave up some daggers for it. At that point, \u2018Uh oh!\u2019 says the man. \u2018I\u2019m going to get out of here now! It looks like a press gang is in town!\u2019<br/><br/>And then we rolled initiative. <br/><br/>It was a pretty nice fight. I used the Human Bandit stats from the Monster Manual, re-calculating hp at 10 each. Three press-ganging sailors ganged up on Fin Fang and clubbed him senseless\u2014although not before he managed to tag them with his Sleep spell, putting two of them under. But the remaining sailor stayed on his feet and started slowly dragging the unconscious Fin Fang toward the docks, yawning all the while. The other three sailors formed a cordon and snarled at bystanders not to interfere\u2014advice that our heroes did not heed.<br/><br/>Tom\u2019s guard drake came in handy, ripping the throat out of one of the press-gangers (\u2018I wonder why this game doesn\u2019t give me nightmares,\u2019 said Jack), and Max showed some rules-savvy by running past the cordon and using a funky paladin power that gave Fin Fang a healing surge, so that he came to and was not in fact dragged off to be a sailor\u2014but it was close.<br/><br/>After the remaining sailors were subdued, the governor of the town came up and in the name of the Beloved High Dragon rewarded them with 10 gp each for taking care of these terrible pirates that had been plaguing the town. The party then chipped in to hear rumors from the rumor monger at 1 gp for each information, and learned that the Machinesmith Orcs had fallen under the sway of the Shadow, the Gnomes of Gomondor had besieged the Towers of Ioun, and a high priest of Gruumsh had arisen in the Sulfur Swamp.  All right, so I lied--that was another bit of prep I\u2019d done: throwing cards from the Deck of Many Things to figure out what was happening in the rest of the world. This provoked a little conversation about what the party should do next, which was solved when we noticed that Tom, who wanted to go to the Towers of Ioun to take on the gnomes that killed his character's family, wouldn't be there next time, so next session would be about something else.<br/><br/>But Jack\u2019s character didn\u2019t chip in for the rumor monger; he took his money and went to the drake peddler instead. He traded the map and the gold he\u2019d earned for a little needlefang drake that could ride on his shoulder. The peddler explained that you had to be careful with needlefangs, since they tended to breed, but it should be all right. Jack wondered if his needlefang was a boy or a girl. He blew his Nature roll, so I told him it definitely a male. Also, the last they saw of the drake peddler, he had closed up shop and was getting together some camping equipment, as if he was about to go follow the map that Jack had given up.<br/><br/>And that about wrapped it up. The adventurers are now bound for the Mountains of the Moon, where wizards watch the world through crystal balls, to seek out the Amulet of the Sky that will allow the vampiric Lord and Lady of Mankara to be killed at night. Their journey will require a voyage at sea, and so I have visions of superstitious sailors being upset because the rats have gone missing, which presages a fight where swarms of hungry little lizards roam over the deck and a giant man-eating squid sends it tentacles into the rigging after the sailors. And then a storm comes up. That\u2019s an exciting two-hour fight right there.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315957/#Comment_315957" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T21:39:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  9:39PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time I think I'm over my desire to play D&amp;D, something drags me back in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316018/#Comment_316018" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T10:11:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 10:11AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2011 11:54AM by Valamir.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Wait, said Jack (Max\u2019s kid brother, the third grader).
