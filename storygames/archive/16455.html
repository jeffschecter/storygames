What his/her class? Level? Magic weapons? Spells? Hit points?<br/><br/>I'll go first.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Cheng Fong (known to the crew of the Argosy as LT) is level-headed and decent. But his wife died in cryostasis, and her corpse was mangled by a huge insectile robot, and now LT has gone insane, assaulting various members of the crew and giving orders at gunpoint. Wide-eyed, sweaty, and completely off his bananas, LT is seeing his wife's ghost everywhere he goes; he's managed to keep this secret, and has been pushing the crew to stop deciding important matters via democratic methods, ceding all authority to him (because he's the man with the gun). We'll never know how they would have responded to his demands, because another crew member attacked and subdued LT, and they're going to put him back into cryostasis, even though it might kill him. He's just too risky.<br/><br/>Naturally, he's going to get loose next week, and he's going to be looking for some payback. <i>His wife knows the new combination to the weapons locker.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376430/#Comment_376430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T13:34:52+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  1:34PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>His wife knows the new combination to the weapons locker.</blockquote>\nThis is the disadvantage in giving Rafael control over People and the Mission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376437/#Comment_376437" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T14:22:55+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  2:22PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 2:27PM by Lula.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fastest-rising star in the underground rap scene is MC Trancephorm.<br/><br/>Born on the island of Sh\xe0ol\xedn (also known as Staten Island), a young Victoria Ocean learned to repel playground bullies, scary dogs, and other neighborhood threats by making up for her small size with a powerful voice. A lover of books, words, and language, she hit the freestyle cipher and battle circuits as MC Trancephorm. Foolish MCs expected the little girl with the huge afro to be no more than a novelty. When her first couplets hit them like meteor hammers, they found they were wrong. It was not long before Trance attracted the notice of the W\u01d4d\u0101ng Clan.<br/><br/>With influence spreading from W\u01d4d\u0101ng Mountain in H\xfab\u011bi, China to New York, New York, the Clan is a secretive conclave dedicated to a D\xe0oist priest's ancient studies and duties: Chinese boxing; subtly influencing politics to follow the Way; intercession between humankind and supernatural beings such as hopping vampires and faerie immortals; and the balance of the five elements: emceeing (also known as water), DJing (aka metal), beat boxing (earth), graffiti (wood), and break dancing (fire). The W\u01d4d\u0101ng Clan has a historical rivalry with the Ch\xe1n Buddhists of the Sh\xe0ol\xedn Temple, and has been linked to esoteric masters such as the White Eyebrow, L\u01d0 M\xf9 B\xe1i, RZA, GZA, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Masta Killa, Method Man, Ghostface Killah, and the Ol' Dirty Bastard (recently deceased, but continues to advise the Clan via spirit channeling). They are widely agreed to be nothing to fuck with.<br/><br/>With a strong foundation in the American martial arts from her older brothers' tutelage in the 52 Hand Blocks, Trance's training continues apace in the ancient W\u01d4d\u0101ng techniques of hand-to-hand and rap battle, specializing in the legendary style known as "the Liquid Sword." Her weapon is the Iron Mic, a demon-bound microphone which can morph into any of the classical Chinese blades, such as the straight sword, curved sword, spear, and glaive. Her allies include the Tunisian sorceress and punk rocker Layla bint Samir bin Badr al-Najwa al-Safaqisiyah and the Chinese-American fencer Alicia Gu\xec. She has clashed frequently with the Clan of the White Lotus and with the r\u0101k\u1e63asi terrorist Coimbatore Raavanan Puja of the recently dissolved Tami\u1e3b Tigers.<br/><br/>You wanna battle? She's always ready.

He's one of the few citizens of the wasted future who has never killed, and because he was one of the most charismatic citizens of Ga Leria, the hardholder was always out to get him - so his friend October seduced the hardholder and killed him. And ... it was only natural for Chairman to take his place. Self-fulfilling prophecy on the old hardholder's part. But Chairman's pacifism and idealistic vision is no match for the anything-to-survive future - under his hold, Ga Leria is constantly suffering from some shortage or other, or white sickness, and once a deal Chairman made with the Entity behind the white went sour, white zombies attacked, and Chairman's men routed. When we last left our hero, he and some of his friends had retreated to the second floor of Ga Leria to make a stand, leaving the bottom floor to the infected zombies...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376442/#Comment_376442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T14:39:22+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  2:39PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
