It seems to me like an under-utilized mechanic in the rules, and I'm not sure why.  <br/><br/>Our group ends up not using them much, at least partly because we often avoid going into the Bringing Down the Pain altogether.  Maybe we don't use it because it seems like extra fiddly bits, but I think at least partly it's lack of imagination.  I know I've used a "Medallion of Law" in one game, which gave +3 Armor in legal debates in the royal court, and in another game a briefcase full of money was a +3 Weapon in negotiations (Sway).<br/><br/>So how much do you use Weapons and Armor?  Are they just the product of character Secrets, or do you introduce them to the story in other ways?  Outside of the obvious combat model (swords, shields, etc.), what other creative and interesting ways have you put the Weapons and Armor to the test?  Alternately, if you don't use them, why not?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130607/#Comment_130607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T13:54:06+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Never had a +3, but had a +2. +1 bonuses were given regularly for improvisational actions and "scene weapons".  Armor, though... we didn't use much at all.<br/><br/>If I had a choice, I'd say that everyone starts off with "8 points", which they can spend on weapons or armor as explained by the TSOY guide: Spear +1, Leather Armor +1, Unshakable resolve +1 (social/spiritual), Barbed Tongue (+2 with put-downs in social situations). This gives them 2-3 pieces of "gear" that they can keep from adventure to adventure. I'd say that most people would have "5 points" in gear they have "every adventure", and those spare 3 points could be used on the fly to invent the character further. It would be like Wizard Spells: Every session you keep what you had last time, unless you wanted to make changes.<br/><br/>Then maybe you could spend an advance for "3 more point slots" for weapons/armor.<br/><br/>Hmmm.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130616/#Comment_130616" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T14:13:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  2:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 2:16PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>China Stargate game</blockquote>\nMore please.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and... we haven't used weapons and armor much in or TSOY games.

Of those, the fencing scarf has actually come in the most, due to the bonus dice. As we've only brought down the pain like half a dozen times, the others have maybe been used once or twice each, and even the scarf has only been used in one BDTP. The one conflict where the mayoral stuff did come into play, however, was brutal and let Olivia crush everyone who stood before her. <br/><br/>Color wise, the scarf is a constant presence in scenes, and constantly being used for stunts and stuff. One of the biggest conflicts in the game was an extended contest to steal the Mayoral Seal from Olivia (she lost, and not long there after lost her seat as mayor because without the weapon she couldn't beat the consortium that had allied against her). So even when they aren't actually changing conflicts with their bonuses, they still have an impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130634/#Comment_130634" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T14:46:32+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  2:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The biggest obstacle for weapons and armor is that it costs a Secret of Imbument to keep anything.

In fact, "When using a weapon, if your character is successful in an action, you can add the weapon's rating to your success level." Weapons are <em>boss</em>, which is why they cost so much. ("Armor subtracts from the success level of actions taken against you." Note that neither of these rules let you move a success level lower than Marginal (1) or higher than Ultimate (6).<br/><br/>And John, yes, you can have a bonus die in any situation where the Story Guide thinks you're better equipped. It's total GM-fiat craziness, but it works well in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130696/#Comment_130696" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:44:32+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:44PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton, you have just <i>blown my mind</i>.  <br/><br/>How in the hell did I miss that?

The thing that makes it look like your original interpretation was correct is that, in the weapons and armor chapter, weapons are listed as "+X harm", and armor as "+X protection". This certainly implies that you only add the bonus if you were successful in the sense that you not only scored a 1 or higher but also rolled better than your opponent.<br/><br/>I hope we can clear this up! <br/><br/>I'm also not 100% sure whether harm dealt from rolls is always equal to the _difference_ between two rolls, or if it is sometimes equal to the result level of the roll, period.* Like, if you roll 2 and I roll 3, I still deal harm level 3. This happens in the opening of the example BDTP, for example, and in the poison rules as well (you take harm equal to the potency, not the difference between the potency and your Endure roll).<br/><br/>*: Parallel actions always deal harm equal to their result.

That is, the Story Guide can set a conflict to be harmful, and harm will result from it. (Note that harm only shakes down after BDTP, so a harmful simple contest can result in serious pain. That's intentional, to balance it against BDTP.)<br/><br/>- Both of those are right. The base harm is your Success Level, plus anything from secrets or weapons.

I like the up-front bonus outside of BDTP because it forces BDTP sometimes and because weapons are sort of meaningless otherwise outside of BDTP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131898/#Comment_131898" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T11:21:22+00:00" title="March  1, 2008 11:21AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. I'd thought of that, and I think I reconciled it in my head like, "well, that's 'cuz BDTP is where it really hits the fan, and your eadly Daggers of Defenestration become a truly nasty menace." Also, I kinda favor setting "take Harm equal to success margin" as common stakes in Simple Contests.<br/><br/>Good point about forcing BDTP though.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
