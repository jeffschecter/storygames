By the absolute, denotative standard, if it wasn't done before, and then it was; it's innovative. One can contextualize--frex, rolling dice to determine resources hasn't been innovative since the earliest gambling games, but it was innovative for the RPG world, where prior to that (wargames) resources tended to be static by unit--or one can just say "new or not, period."<br/><br/>In the pure, non-contextual case, there's probably only been a handful of innovations in the history of RPGs, starting with "we're going to use rules to inform a story, rather than just pass the stick or sit and watch one person tell it." Some have, yep, been done by folks on these boards.<br/><br/>And to REALLY get your noodle in a knot: is it "innovative" to essentially put a term of negation in front of a common practice, "flipping the mode?" For example, "RPGs are NOT about winning" or "in this RPG, you never control one PC exclusively"?<br/><br/>I came not to bury this thread, but to praise it--through context.

And while we can prize innovation, in the sense that we are looking for the next hot newness, innovation is also a potential turn-off or disincentive: it is possible for something to be too new, too different from "how we do it now" to be practicable. Not for nothing is there a whole field of social science interested in "diffusion of innovations" (how new ideas spread within and across communities); concepts from this field like "change agent" and "early adopter" have entered more general usage.<br/><br/>So the interesting question may have to do with this: what are the RPG innovations that have a chance of widespread adoption, and which are likely to remain relatively rare? What innovations have gained currency, and which haven't over the past several years?<br/><br/>For example, I think the arrival of IAWA with its oracles for situation generation gives Ganakagok a better shot at adoption because of how it lets gamers try out the innovation of interpreting card meanings to create situation, which Ganakagok incorporates to a greater extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183741/#Comment_183741" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T13:05:32+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  1:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually think the idea of focusing on innovation is a bad thing generally, and specifically with regard to games.

He plays those other games. The emergent thing doesn't happen. Then he goes back and plays his successfully emergent-play-making game but with a different group, and again <i>it doesn't happen.</i><br/><br/>Storygamer Paul v2 picks up The New Hotness and wants to know why rule X exists, because the rest of the rules are written in an opaque way. I ask a community of gamers (say, story-cunts.com) about the intent of rule X, and get a bunch of coy bullshit. They don't want to spoil the surprise. This pisses me off, because I have yet to see a game that consistently produces an "emergent" property of play. <br/><br/>Any bit of awesome "emergent" play I've ever gotten out of a game is lightning in a bottle -- so much depends on the players, expectations set in the text, our willingness to study or not study a game. Example: I've had incredibly neat things emerge from Lacuna, and I've had total dud Lacuna sessions. <br/><br/>At this point, I'd rather just have a straight no-bullshit understanding of a designer's intent. I don't care about having my surprise spoiled. I DO care about drilling down to the good stuff in a game. I don't want to take the chance that I may waste an evening.<br/><br/>When someone writes a game such that a specific emergent quality of play can be consistently created without revealing its existence in the game text, I'll enjoy the experience. But as of now, the notion of baking a hidden emergent play quality into a game just pisses me off. Nobody can do it consistently, and when it doesn't happen it makes me feel like I've played the game "wrong."

That's a cynical position, albeit one with a grain of truth: everything comes from somewhere, indeed. But you could invert that with as much truth: everything  has some novelty to it, since even a reiteration adds something by virtue of the mere fact of its repetition. We may both agree that most new things are mere elaborations of the old, but then it's glass half-full/half-empty time.<br/><br/>It's not clear to me why there's so much resistance to the idea of novelty in these threads, unless it has something to do with not wanting to be vulnerable to charges of slavish faddism. But we always ask each other, don't we, what's new and different about the games we're working on? Because if there's nothing new about it, we wonder why make the game at all. I guess the word "innovation" smacks of business jargon and management guru-speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183796/#Comment_183796" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T17:11:28+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:11PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2008 6:00PM by Burr.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/>But you have to imagine that every new game is in some fashion different from the games that came before it, so to that extent at least there's a<i>degree</i>of innovation in every game.

You suddenly take away from the game one essential quality of the former kind, and so suddenly the game becomes representative of a different kind.*<br/><br/><i>A game represents a kind of game that is innovative of games if and only if it lacks at least one essential quality of any previously existing kind of game.  The game itself is innovative of games if and only if it is the first of its kind.</i><br/><br/>If the above statements are true, then:<br/><br/>Innovation of games may <i>not</i> be purely additive in relation to another kind of game.  "D&amp;D Plus Food Fights" is not innovative because it retains all the essential qualities of D&amp;D.  The game is not the first of its kind.  (Wait, back up.  It's not strictly correct to say that "D&amp;D + FF" would not be innovative.  It may be an innovation of <i>D&amp;D</i>; it just wouldn't be an innovation of <i>games</i>.  See what I did there?)<br/><br/>Innovation of games <i>may</i> be purely subtractive in relation to another kind of game.  Assuming characters are an essential quality of D&amp;D, then "D&amp;D Minus Characters" is innovative so long as there has never been such a game.  "D&amp;D - C" may be innovative even if there <i>has</i> previously been a not-purely-subtractive game like "D&amp;D + FF - C".  (However, practically speaking, it isn't likely that the latter game would have been created without at least a foray in the former territory.)<br/><br/>Of course, even assuming I didn't screw up my logic/wording above, this argument assumes that games may be categorized into kinds of games determined by essential qualities.  Instead, maybe a game can be modified by degree with <i>no</i> point at which a change from one kind to another may be recognized.<br/><br/><br/>*Objection: Essential qualities may be possessed to different levels of degree, thereby making the change from possessing them to not possessing them not so sudden.  An example may be colors perceived as pure versus colors perceived as mixtures of pure colors (ala the theory behind NCS color codes).  From one pure color to another, there may be no clear demarcation.  One pure color may provide a clear demarcation between two other pure colors or mixtures of colors, so there may be kinds nevertheless.<br/><br/>In the context of universally defining innovation of games, it seems like this would require a predefined set of pure kinds of games.  Innovation would be either proving the existence of previously undiscovered pure kinds of games, or less dramatically, concocting untried mixtures of the pure kinds of games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183804/#Comment_183804" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T17:37:10+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Innovation is the new new new new new honesty.<br/><br/>I think that when people ask me to talk about something innovative that I have seen, I either:<br/>(A.) scoff, and lecture them on how innovation is not a useful marker for quality, or<br/>(B.) talk about something really cool which shifted my paradigm/view.<br/><br/>(B.) does not directly correlate to "innovation" in a dictionary sense, but... it is the useful take-away from successful innovation, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183805/#Comment_183805" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T17:38:31+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:38PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I think it comes down to the definition of innovation. I largely want to use tried and true techniques, but use them in a new way, much like Ralph has deliberately done with Blood Red Sands. To me, that's not innovation, so much as refinement. So, it's definitional. Apparently I'm learning that my definition clashes with some others' definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to do something, and the only way to do it is to come up with a new technique, and that technique really does that thing, great. If you're trying to do something just because it's never been done before, I think that is less likely to come out well. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flipside, Alexander Cherry did that very thing. He went up on the Forge and basically suggested a random idea of using a roulette wheel as the core of a game. Someone basically told him to put up or shut up, so he did. The result that came about is a game I like very much. So I guess now I'm playing devil's advocate for my own stance. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to refine my stance then, to take in this completely valid point. Touting a game as good simply because it is innovative is false. Playing with mechanical innovations can be fun all by itself, without turning it into a game, or it can produce very cool effects in play. Creating a game that doesn't try to innovate does not mean the game will suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183874/#Comment_183874" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T05:51:55+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  5:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Well, Matthijs, it's nothing new; it's "what does [word x] mean?"</blockquote>\nWhen I talked about killing discussions, I meant starting a thread with this: "Here's a topic that <b>I don't care about at all</b>, but that clearly needs a thread (...) <b>Explain why other people's examples aren't innovation at all.</b>" I was wrong, obviously, since this thread looks lively enough - but my point was that by starting the thread with a yawn, Tony might influence people not to post anything.<br/><br/>It was just a throwaway comment, though; just a joke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183879/#Comment_183879" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T06:15:12+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  6:15AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason, "hackles" indeed "get raised" when the word Innovation is brandied about on RPG forums.

I don't do anything about it. Is that an innovation? Five people talk about some cool new idea. A sixth listens to them, develops the idea for sale and makes a million. Who's the innovator?<br/><br/>Innovation is great, but it's just raw material. It needs to be made into something that people can use, and people must be made aware of it and start using it. Otherwise it's just... well, nothing, really. A by-product of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
