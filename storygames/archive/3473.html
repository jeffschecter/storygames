That's pretty much what the indie thing is all about.<br/><br/>Also, I hope that Jesse continues with Sorcerer Unbound. That might be the Revised/Second Edition that we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also agree with Thor's statements above.  Feel free to talk about it if you want to here.

Jesse Burneko has followed Sorcerer for a long time and has had a lot of issues in figuring out how to run the game. As such he's hoping that he can impart the answers to these issues that he's gotten from Ron and others in his book.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like "D&amp;D; for Dummies" is for D&amp;D;, perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Ron's making a principled choice here. He believes that the text works as written (and it does for some). He doesn't have anything that he feels needs to be altered in the rules to make the game work better. It's not broken, so why does it need to be fixed? I would hazzard that he probably feels that putting out a new edition would be profiteering of the sort that he feels damages RPGs. Are we playing Sorcerer, or Sorcerer Revised today? Better to leave each group to determine how to play it as it stands than split up the people who are interested in playing. Or to make people pay to buy the same rules yet again just to feel that they're up-to-date.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a supplement like Unbound, that's just one interpetation of the text that one can accept or discard at will, and not have to purchase a new edition. If Sorcerer works for you already, then you don't have to buy it. If you think the game could run better, you might want to pick up the supplement so you can see if there's anything there that you can use. But the supplement in no way makes the original rules obsolete.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems a reasonable way to go to me. Especially since Ron wouldn't profit from the supplement (in which case his profiteering argument wouldn't be as strong).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I'm biased, I'm releasing a supplement for Sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78343/#Comment_78343" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T07:38:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  7:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was fairly tongue in cheek, yes, but think about this:<br><br>Let's say I publish a novel. <br><br>You read it and don't understand how Colonel Cadwaller was able to escape the vicious cultists in chapter nine.<br><br>Would the novel be improved if I insert clearer exposition? Perhaps it might. But it's not a given thing. You might have skimmed over something that was important, and nobody else has this problem. You  might be very persnickety when I, by contrast, was just handwaving and didn't want to waste a lot of time on the Colonel's escape. <br><br>In any event it is certainly not clear that my work would be automatically improved by clarifying it.  What if I  clarified it and everyone else was horrified to discover that Colonel Cadwaller's escape had not been what they thought, in my vagueness, it was - that it instead was something really awful that ruins other parts of the book.<br><br>I suspect that is what would happen for me if Edwards did a revised Sorcerer. Everything he's said (for example in the threads he links to there) about his game indicates to me that he has not one single clue about what's cool about his game. In that respect he is in good company. That is true of all game designers, ever. Still, it means that a revised edition aimed at 'clarifying' his intent would make the game worse, not better, for me, and I suspect for a goodly chunk of people out there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78344/#Comment_78344" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T07:39:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  7:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 7:40AM by Andy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark: Exactly.<br><br>It seems to me that lots of people (MYSELF INCLUDED!! :-) ) are wanting Ron to go back and revise the game. Rewrite it so that "Step 2" of learning the game is "Read the Play Examples" and not "Start three conversations on the forums to try to understand the game". It's not Ron's job to do so, nor is he obliged to.<br/><br/>It reminds me of Clinton's statement a while ago saying how people are contacting him, angry or upset that the games he's working on aren't released yet (or that he's not working faster at them). Our Want/Desire does not translate into an imperative for the original author. <br/><br/>As long as Ron is open to the concept (in fact he might be hoping that it happens), if someone else wants to come along and rewrite Sorcerer so that it can be grokked on the first read, successful on the first play, and totally self-contained, then awesome. We Win, because we get "Sorcerer Revised", the Author Wins, because they get some scrilla from the deal, and Ron Wins because it happens without him having to give up his nights and weekends to Make it happen.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78378/#Comment_78378" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T08:58:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  8:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My purpose in starting this thread was to urge people to post to the Forge thread http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24176.msg236547#new<br/>\n<br/>\nindicating that understanding the Sorcerer text, as presented, is difficult even for those inclined toward the kind of play it supports.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Julian" title="Julian"><img alt="Julian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Julian">Julian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78432/#Comment_78432" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T10:51:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 10:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the purpose of people doing so?<br/><br/>Ron knows lots of people bounce off the Sorcerer text.<br/><br/>He doesn't care.<br/><br/>If anything, I'd say he likes it that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78434/#Comment_78434" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T10:53:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 10:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one of the loudest proponents of Sorcerer's text getting some procedural clean up, I also say this is a profoundly BAD idea.

Magnificently, even. I had some suspicion about the underlying reasons, but never had seen them before (mostly <i>because I never asked him myself</i>, duh). He wrote a clarifier, but the clarifier became the Clear Reason, a reason I can understand and totally respect:\n<blockquote>Quick clarifier: I'd always assumed the audience for Sorcerer would be small - very small. I printed less than 1500 copies for the first print run and never expected to print any more; I also planned for the supplements to remain in PDF form with the possible exception of Sorcerer &amp; Sword. The money shocked me and made it possible for things to be different. So yes, (b) is a lot larger than (a). What surprises me, still does, is that (b) exists at all today, relative to Sorcerer. Why not play The Shadow of Yesterday, Dust Devils, Dogs in the Vineyard, Universalis, or The Mountain Witch instead? All of which are strongly influenced by Sorcerer in different ways and far better written toward the (b) audience, mainly because the authors were themselves (b) and went through a kind of Sorcerer apprenticeship.<br/><br/>That clarifier, though, raises a key point which I haven't articulated in any of the discussions yet, or barely. It is that a given work, to me, exists in a given place and time. Sorcerer is my mid-late 1990s game, written by me shortly before and during my thirtieth birthday. It was born from my deliberate decision to return to role-playing after I'd done what I could with Champions and Cyberpunk, after I'd read Prince Valiant and Over the Edge, and after I'd been astonished at playing Zero.<br/><br/>I'm 42 now. My gaming history is different, resting on over ten years of joyous, continuous, highly social play with dozens and even hundreds of people, and almost as many games. My desired audiences for my work are different, and my creative ambitions are different. Rather than endlessly revise and update Piece of Work <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, I have moved on to Piece of Work <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (Trollbabe), and then, as time went on, to Piece of Work <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (Mutual Decision and possible upcoming related work). Also, I am now highly committed to types of creative work which are not even oriented toward this subculture and market (Spione).<br/><b><br/>The aging prof in his early 40s, contemplating things like fatherhood and job-threatening political activism, is not the Ph.D. candidate who needed to write, play, and publish Sorcerer over ten years ago. I'm that man now, and the work I want and need to produce isn't Sorcerer.</b><br/><br/>I mean, I love the game, and I still play it, and playing it still surprises and transforms me. I haven't posted about our game last summer because I don't think it's suitable for internet discussion, politically and emotionally. I think as a game it's stood up to time's usage far better, far more amazingly, then anyone could have expected. (Ten years of successful commerce with no revision? an RPG? wow! That's like Amber.) I also respect and even quite like the (b) audience, and I'm here for them.<br/><br/>But I don't need - and quite possibly am incapable of - writing a text for it again.</blockquote>\nThe question now, of course, is... "Who is the person <b>now</b> who needs to write, play and publish Sorcerer, ten years later?" Is it Jesse with his Sorcerer Unleashed?  Is it someone else with the Sorcerer Wiki of All Explanations?  Is it you? Me?  Who will carry the torch from this point? Or is the torch worth carrying?<br/><br/>Apt questions.  If Jesse is that person, then awesome. I will wait expectantly for the 'revised' edition.  If that person never steps forward, and instead I'm left with a dark, cold void... immediately filled by like a dozen games that are equally awesome (as Ron stated above)... then so be it. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78539/#Comment_78539" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T13:09:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  1:09PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the only problem, if any, is that people aren't told this <i>before</i> they buy the game.

The Shadow of Yesterday was written by a guy in turbulent love, a dabbler in drugs - me a few years ago. I am now in solid awesome love and a straight-edge machine and worry about balancing personal interest versus responsibility to the family unit. It doesn't make the game work less, or age. Sorcerer was hard to understand when it was published, and it didn't get harder or anything because a few years passed.<br/><br/>What did happen, and what explains a lot of the thought-process in evaluating Sorcerer, is that some great games got published that addressed stuff Sorcerer didn't, and people grew to expect that. People expect a game to tell you now, for example, who gets to say what when. When Sorcerer was published, no one expected that, and it played fine. <br/><br/>I can agree that it's nice to talk about what a game is and how you made it and when it was published in the purchase process, sure. But, man, I take umbrage with the thought - which may not have been had - that a game is somehow flawed because it's older.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78547/#Comment_78547" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T13:35:54+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  1:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 1:37PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not the age alone.

That latter group was unexpected by me, but is also welcome, and I give them my personal attention to their learning process. That process is highly individualized and cannot be textual or canonical; it totally depends on where the person is.</blockquote>\nI wasn't informed that I might need highly individualized personal attention from the author in order to understand the product. That's how he <i>historically</i> created it because he didn't expect audience b), but <i>nowadays</i> I expect the majority of customers to fall into that category.<br/><br/>ETA: To clarify: it's a historical artifact because of Ron's inability to foresee audience b). Now that he's aware that audience b) exists and purchases his games, audience b) has a right to know that they might need to work hard to get the game. That's what started this whole thread, some people from audience b) are obviously unhappy to find that this is the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78550/#Comment_78550" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T13:40:29+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  1:40PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian, that is crazy talk.<br/><br/>The author is not <i>required</i> to give any kind of disclosure about his work at all.

If you're annoyed at the lack of disclosure that the book is a historical artifact, and you buy it and don't like it, get a refund -- and tell other people who are thinking about buying the book that it's got that sort of offer outstanding because the author doesn't consider it a text intended for broad consumption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78923/#Comment_78923" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T13:59:24+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  1:59PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Clearly, Sorcerer is still selling, and by Ron's accounts well.</blockquote>\nOh, look, we found the reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78939/#Comment_78939" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T17:51:00+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  5:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think Ron Edwards has any particular obligation to do what people want with his game, and acting otherwise is kind of silly.<br/><br/>But I also don't think it's in any way unexpected or crazy that people who enjoy it would want it to be improved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78941/#Comment_78941" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T19:25:37+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  7:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2007 7:26PM by Alan.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about we call this thread ended?
