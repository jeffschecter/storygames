There are a bunch of humans who like each other so much they meet once a week to roll dice and/or pretend to be wizards. So maybe try to draw some of those real world connections into the game.

When I think of humanity, I think of a million things... funnily enough, the first thing that comes to mind is Homer Simpson. Homer Simpson is a loving portrait of some of the most human things about us humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer the initial question of the thread:<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always thought there were two types of gamers, people that game to grow and people that game to avoid growth. All of the best fantasy elevates us, it makes more human in the sense that it makes are experience of the world more universal.
