By now, we're having a lot of fun with it; it's a nice mix between gruesome and funny. Recommended, a fun and easy game that delivers (once you get into the mindset). <br/><br/>But what I was most curious about was Marc Majcher's <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/twenty-four-game-poems/12919742" rel="nofollow">Twenty-Four Game Poems</a>. I'd skimmed most of the book, and wanted to try out a few games. They're short, very varied, and I have no idea whether they've been playtested, but who cares, right?<br/><br/>The first one we played was "The Sign of the Great Old Elder God From Beyond". It's about one worshipper, and one avatar of the Elder God. The avatar thinks of a ritual, and the worshipper has to ask yes/no questions to find out what it is. Essentially "20 questions", but with a token mechanism that tells you whether the worshipper dies trying, and a rule that each successful guess removes one word from the worshipper's vocabulary. It was okay, didn't last long (5-10 minutes), but didn't have much substance.<br/><br/>The second was "Danse", which is based (not explicitly) on The Masque of the Red Death. You're all partying in an old castle, the plague is outside, and one by one... you die. Excellent color and premise, and some memorable mini-scenes of dying baronesses, midgets, and vulgar barons. I read the rules quickly, and seem to have missed some parts; I think this one could work very well, especially over more time - we spent maybe 20 minutes on it, but an hour would have been cooler, more time to build things up. Being dead means you're out of the game, though, so that might require some changes... Want to play again.<br/><br/>The third was "The Mask". This one reads like something I or one of my friends could have made. You have a very simple paper mask, which is the main character; players take turns being the mask. Along the way, the mask is threatened by one player, and helped by another. Towards the end, there's a resolution where the mask is either destroyed or allowed to live on. Now, this is an empty vessel sort of game; it's completely up to the group how it goes, what the mask is like. Ours ended up being a bit of a meta, abstract figure, and we had some philosophical discussions on where it came from, what it was like not being anything real, whether there was a difference between it and ourselves, etc. I enjoyed it, and want to play it again, probably as a part of a larger exercise. I think an introductory ritual would boost the effect enormously. <br/><br/>Also during the trip, I ran an improvised fantasy RPG for the kids present - my 9-year-old son and the two 8-year-old (?) girls who were there. They really enjoyed it, and I was so happy seeing them enjoy it. They played little elves, investigating their forest, tricking thieves, hunting, finding strange treasure, and finally venturing into an abandoned mine where they found secret rooms and a huge troll. Oh, so many clich\xe9s, and such fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296051/#Comment_296051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-06T08:34:29+00:00" title="October  6, 2010  8:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of all the game poems, Mask definitely caught my attention the most.

Some of the games are definitely lighter than others (TSotGEGFB, frex), but I'm glad to hear that some of the more grounded ones are making an impression on people. The Mask, in particular, came from some deeply creepy experiences with mask work in improv, and it's good to hear that some of that creepiness came across in play.
