I recruited about 12 people, about 4 or 5 of whom want to GM at some point.<br/><br/>Also, one of the players is a linguist and is inventing a language which we are using to name in-game locales. You want Tolkienesque? I got your Tolkienesque right here!<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the big mistakes I made with the first AW&amp;W was that, even though the game had a lot of structure to it, it didn't have an endgame plan right from the start. So with this new game, I wanted there to be such a limit in place.<br/><br/>The story is a totally cheeseball one, but will be fun to play: we have to reassemble the shards of a great and powerful weapon that was shattered in the last battle against the aliens, because the aliens are coming back soon. There are 7 shards and 15 dungeons. Of the dungeons with no shard, 7 will contain clues as to where other shards may or may not be located, and 1 will contain a different artifact. The aliens will show up after 15 sessions, so we are up against the clock here.<br/><br/>Now, here's where I really got clever. I am contracting <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> to decide what goes where, and send the information to my partner, who will put each piece of information in a sealed envelope with the name of that dungeon on the front. Whenever we beat a dungeon, we open its envelope together\u2014it will be a surprise to everyone!<br/><br/>This way, even the GM of each session won't know what the big treasure is; their only responsibility is to prep the dungeon itself. Best of all, I am only going to run the first session, and then work with the other people interested in GMing as needed.<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to starting and hope it doesn't collapse around my ears!<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448103/#Comment_448103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T02:15:21+00:00" title="August 21, 2015  2:15AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That letter twist is soo good and also not too difficult to do!

Then he only GMed when he felt like it (and, as I recall, it was less and less as time went on), and played in people's games occasionally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
