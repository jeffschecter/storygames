Before the rolling of dice the GM would ask something like, "On a scale of 2 to 5, where two is Easy and five is Extreme, what do you think the difficulty should be for this roll?" Or with players familiar with the game, "What do you think the difficulty level should be?"<br/>\nPlayers could discuss between themselves what they think the appropriate difficulty should be, but the active player would have the final say.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you tried this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362303/#Comment_362303" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:07:10+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like it's treading on Czege Principle (=introducing and resolving your own adversity isn't fun) territory.

I've seen games that allow the player to make their task harder (or risk more in case of failure) in exchange for mechanical benefits.  Weighing that tradeoff, especially if it can be spun to dramatic effect, is a neat way to go about things.  Maybe at that point it's less having the player set target numbers as it is allowing them to move the points around a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362308/#Comment_362308" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:11:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Game Chef entry from 2010 did this, but it had a much more adversarial relationship between players and the GM.

Only the player can determine whether or not something requires a roll. The GM prompts this by asking a question: "Is it scary?" or "Is it difficult?" or what have you. If the player says "no" then there is no need to roll. This fits into two feelings of the game:<br>1) That the game is played inside a "safe space" and any adversity that's around is stuff that the players have sought out via their characters.<br>2) That the purpose of play is to discover the characters and the world. Maybe an angry dog isn't scary, to Clover. That's cool. The purpose of the angry dog is that we learn more about the dog, and about Clover, not that it has to pose a particular challenge.<br><br>Clover's free for the asking, btw, so if you want to see the exact way it handles you should <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/?p=35" rel="nofollow">get a copy</a>.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CT" title="CT"><img alt="CT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/3283/hplwormsinheadtiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CT">CT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362312/#Comment_362312" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:21:00+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 9:26AM by CT.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">@PeterBB</a><br/>\nYes, the Czege Principle.

I want to unpack this a little for the OP, in case he hasn't seen those games. For that purpose, I'll use the 7S/L5R mechanics in my explanation just out of familiarity.<br/><br/>In 7S, you have a pool of d10s that you roll for any given task, specified in the form "X keep Y" (or "XkY"), which means "Roll X dice, then sum (usually the highest) Y of them, to get your result". The GM sets a difficulty using the guidelines in the book. Once the GM sets that difficulty, you have the option to take "Raises", adding +5 to the difficulty as many times as you like. For each time you do that, you get to choose some special cool effect to add to the outcome, <i>as long as you still succeed on the whole roll</i>, which you won't know until after you've got the final difficulty (the GM's base plus your Raises) and only then roll the dice. Smart GMs arrange for low base difficulties/pools with large Y values, because players love Raises, and when players choose their special effects, they're being prompted for additional input into the fiction, which is cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362432/#Comment_362432" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T13:50:12+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam Dray's earlier versions of his Cyberpunkish game did this! And it was something sort of reflected in Jeff Schecter's "Exemplar" RPG: <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/exemplar" rel="nofollow">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/exemplar</a> .<br/><br/>Let me go with Jeff's, because it's a little more memorable to me at this moment (I think in Dray's it was a set die pool but you could set the difficulty number). In Exemplar, you rolled d10s. You had a success number, somewhere between 5 and 20 or so depending on your skills and abilities. YOU (the player) determine how many d10s you wanted to roll for the most part. So you set the difficulty yourself.<br/><br/>Roll one and succeed: You narrowly succeed, maybe! The more dice you added, though, the more "critical" the success, the greater the reward. Also, in the end, there was a betting mechanism that basically pulled it away from a Czege "I narrate my trouble then narrate my way out of it" trap: <br/><br/>Basically, if you were against an opponent (played by the GM or another player) you set your difficulty against them, they against you, and you rolled off: If you succeeded and the other failed, you win they lose. If you BOTH succeeded, the person who dedicated the most dice and thus upped their own difficulty in the gamble is the one who Really Wins.<br/><br/>I really, REALLY am in love with that style of system, "set your own difficulty... with a catch". In fact, it's the core of a game I've been on-again off-again working on for a while now. We'll see later if it still has legs. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362442/#Comment_362442" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:15:33+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell, the concept basically comes from The Pool.

There are so many directions a designer could take with this. I really need to play some of these games and see how this feels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of letting the player decide what is important, but with consequences is very appealing. Andy put it best, "set your own difficulty... with a catch."<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing able to choose when to risk it all, and when to play it safe can be a big deal. Maybe we've all been there, I know I've seen other players in this situation, where something was so important you just couldn't bear the consequences of failure. It seems to me that having the option to lower the risk and keep something (your character, part of the fiction, etc.) safe would encourage player investment in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the higher risk = greater reward aspect adds that addictive rush only gambling can provide.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is for me one of those times where you discover a book, style of music, or movie which has been around for years but you've never heard of.
