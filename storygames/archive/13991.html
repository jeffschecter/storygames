Mindless cheerleading for editing is counterproductive. What kind of editor? What's their experience? What are they better and worse at? The right editor will get you to a quality text more quickly and with less stress, but it's not magic, and briefing editors as to what you want is a vital part of the job. A good editor will ask you lots of questions. What's the intended audience? What are you assuming about this audience? What would you particularly like to improve? What is set in stone and can't be altered? And so on. Anyone who gets to work on your text without asking questions is a non-starter in my book.<br/><br/>I have to use freelancers from time to time in my work, and I don't see any obvious relation between their hourly rates and their qualities. If you can find an someone who makes a living editing, but who likes your text enough to work with you for nothing, that's usually a good deal, so long as you don't mind taking second place to their paid work. If you need to be first in line, obviously you need to cough up.</blockquote>\nDave, as someone who has a degree in English and was an editor at my college's award-winning paper, I'm basically with you. Whether or not "editor-serving drivel" is the right phrase for maximum audience engagement aside, the sentiment is one with sense.<br/><br/>And I say that as someone who has both charged good money to be an editor, and been willing to pay good money for an editor.<br/><br/>I feel like there's this insidious thing, not really intentional, that we have to be on the lookout for; Shreyas touched on it briefly and caustically in Jonathan's blog post, using words I do not think were appropriate. But let me break it down in a more sensical way:<br/><br/>- Recently, there's been a pro-editor movement that is best summed up as "Pay for an editor! The more you pay, the better! It's worth it!" I do realize and accept and appreciate not all pro-editor discussions have taken this tack.<br/><br/>- This sentiment, or sentiments similar to it, tend to have two types of champions: those who charge good money for editing, and those who have paid good money for editing.<br/><br/>- When someone who has paid triple digits or more for editing says "You <i>have</i> to have your game edited professionally to have a good product," there's an element of privilege and an element of promotion there: essentially saying, <i>My product is a good product and yours is not.</i><br/><br/>So with all of those weird political issues around editing, and the fact that many vocal, popular game designers roll their eyes at hiring an editor\u2014 while many others think that doing so is a jackass move that harms new designers (who may stop working on a game if they think they need to shell out hundreds for editing! It's so complex!)\u2014 doesn't help matters much.<br/><br/><br/>Here's my take. With copy editing from Vincent Baker, who did an awesome job, Blowback was basically "developmentally edited" by two people: Ryan Macklin The Professional Editor From The Internet, and Jonathan Walton The Dude With A Liberal Arts Degree And A Banjo. Ryan edited the first section of the book: Introduction, Analysis, Operation, and Blowback. Jonathan edited the second half of the book, which was the GM guide. If you have a copy of the game or the PDF you can compare the two sections and see what you think.<br/><br/>Here was my experience, between using a professional vs. my buddy.<br/><br/><br/>With Ryan:<br/><br/>- I was more likely to take it wordlessly, because was I going to pay him and then ignore him? And I think this made the text better.<br/>- I don't know him quite as well, so I wasn't willing to push when I disagreed with what he said.<br/>- He pointed out glaring organizational issues and text clarity issues I felt like an idiot for not seeing.<br/>- He was super encouraging, super polite, and generally pleasant to work with.<br/>- I haven't gotten many comments on the first section, but people seem to instantly grab the book and know how to play, which I attribute to Ryan.<br/>- The main problem people have had was with the explanation in the Blowback section, and regardless of any help I got there, it's my bad as an author when I publish something that isn't clear.<br/><br/>Please note that due to my scheduling fuckup, Ryan was not able to do more than one pass with me or do the second half, which is where Jonathan came in. Jonathan also did one pass with me, IIRC. Some editors, free and paid, do multiple passes with you.<br/><br/>With Jonathan:<br/><br/>- We have a storied history, so if I thought he was saying something dumb I told him so.<br/>- Likewise, if what I said made no fucking sense, he told me so. Jonathan has never sugar coated a thing for me.<br/>- His insight as someone who enjoys running games was immeasurably helpful for writing the section about getting people excited to run the game.<br/>- He pointed out areas where I'd completely forgotten to explain my train of thought\u2014 recognizing them even though he knows me well enough to fill in the blank spots.<br/>- Bonus: he was able to correct my Chinese spelling in the glossary and wrote up a kickass location breakdown of Nanjing.<br/>- The <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> comment I have gotten on the text of the book is this: "The GM advice is crystal clear and makes me want to play the game SO BAD."<br/>- There was the thing where if he wanted me to change something and I didn't want to, it made chit-chatting with my friend more difficult, because I wanted to set his hair on fire. So there's that.<br/><br/><br/>So what's the takeaway from this? Damned if I know. Both editors did good work I would be proud to have in any future game. One was professional, one wasn't. I think maybe it's just that you should have someone smart look over your game\u2014 and as long as you choose the right people, it doesn't matter if you crowdsource to five people (I'm doing QA on software that crowdsources editing of textbooks RIGHT NOW, in fact), you hire someone for a bazillion dollars or pay a friend who had a journalism minor with a six-pack of beer. Whoever you choose should:<br/><br/>- Have a strong grasp of text organization<br/>- Be good at parsing instructions<br/>- Love, love, love RPGs, and know what makes them interested when reading a new one for the first time.<br/><br/>In MY opinion, at least, that's all that matters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317113/#Comment_317113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T17:52:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  5:52PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A final addendum.

I think, honestly, that our back and forth was a bit more heated than normal partially because I was giving her comments over chat, page by page, as I read it (with her sending me edited pages as we went), so there was an immediacy and urgency to the feedback (we're were trying to get the last half done on a sharp deadline) that wouldn't have happened if I had sent her pages of comments and edits and she'd had time to consider them.

In my work, we do something called "second writer review" where another writer who understands the source material well reviews the text for basic problems before it gets passed to me for polishing, style, organisation, and so on. This sounds pretty similar to what you describe.<br/><br/>The biggest single thing that everyone should do is to get *at least* one person to read your text who doesn't know what you meant to say, who sees it without prejudice and who will give clear, honest feedback. Sometimes you'll get more out of someone like Jonathan, who has great experience of games, than from someone like me who knows the difference between "due to" and "owing to" (actually I suspect Jonathan does too, but you get the idea). Ideally you would have a range of such people and the combination you describe sounds good to me. How many usually depends how much of this you can tolerate. Returns diminish as the process goes on, but the longer and more complex the text, the more room for improvement.<br/><br/>Do I think a professional editor should be one of the people who looks at your text? I'd like to say - if you want to catch every typo, avoid unintended meanings and unconscious writing choices, and make sure every word is there for a reason, then yes. But truthfully, I can't guarantee 100% and I doubt anyone can. I just catch a higher percentage of these things than folks who don't do this every day. Horses for courses.<br/><br/>Should a pro editor be the *only* person who reviews your text? Definitely not: if you have other good choices available, I would use them, and probably use them first. That's a no-brainer.<br/><br/>There's no ideal workflow either. My only rule is to address big problems first, small problems later. There's no point in polishing a sentence that should never have been included, and no-one can polish the one that has yet to be written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317192/#Comment_317192" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T15:51:03+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  3:51PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>- Recently, there's been a pro-editor movement that is best summed up as "Pay for an editor!

Here's where I'm at:<br/><br/>In the past little while, there's been a couple of adages thrown around about how to design well: playtest thoroughly; don't try to use playtesting to solve all of your problems; hire an editor; design through play.<br/><br/>I think that at their core, these are all (at least partially) about the same thing:<br/><b>Honour yourself as a game designer. Honour your game. Honour the process of creating your game.</b><br/><br/>The specifics of that honour is going to be different for everyone. That's part of what honouring the process and honouring yourself means. Games require different things. Products require different things. Slapping some template workflow onto your game might not do it justice.<br/><br/>For me, I've had a history of being hasty, of rushing through parts of the design process in order to declare myself  finished. I've failed to honour my game and the process behind finishing it. Learning to accept development and refinement as part of the process - nay, to honour and cherish it - is of vital importance to me. Sometimes, that looks like hiring a professional editor. For me, it's not about editing being the most important thing. It's about teaching myself to value my own products, and part of that is waving around a big flag that points out the areas I need to improve in.<br/><br/>I'm a good designer and a terrible developer. Honouring my games involves finding ways to better honour the process of development. Hiring an editor is one of those ways.<br/><br/>So: maybe that's a solution, and a good way to figure out whether your game needs an editor. Honor yourself, the game, and the process. Figure out what that means, case by case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317212/#Comment_317212" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T19:21:07+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  7:21PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            200% agreement, Joe.  Nice way of putting it.  For me, honoring my games has meant -- so far -- choosing not to commercially publish them and let them grow in slow iterations through free PDF drafts that come whenever they come. Do I need an editor?  Maybe, but I haven't yet found the right person who can give me the help I need.  But I'm not going to wait around for the right person or hire the wrong person, so instead I plod along and know I'll get there eventually.  That's what respecting my own work means for me right now.  And, in the meantime, I try to respect other people's processes and whatever choices they're making for their own games, even if they are really different than the choices I would have made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317222/#Comment_317222" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T20:46:24+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  8:46PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2011 8:58PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since people are throwing my name around, here're my thoughts. <a href="http://RyanMacklin.com/tag/editing/" rel="nofollow">I have a fuckton more thoughts on editing on my blog.</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

To me, I'm still just a <em>mouthy fuck</em> that's got a mild learning/reading disability that makes me have to concentrate on text. Particularly hard texts literally give me a headache. (Seriously literally. I have books from indieland that honestly physically hurt to read, so I can't read them.) And I grew up in a very manipulative household, so I had to have a command over language or I was fucked.<br/><br/>I certainly didn't go to school for this. I mean, fuck, I'm a software developer by trade. (And a pretty decent one, if I may say so.) The fact that I'm a professional hard-hacker (computers) and soft-hacker (language) is a gigantic fucking fluke. And I'm certainly not on my game as much as Thor Olavsrud is. That dude is fucking amazing.<br/><br/>So it still weirds me out. I just play along 99% of the time, and tell people that I could be wrong about stuff in my edits, so when that happens we should talk. Apparently that is why I'm a good editor, so people say.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>We don't want a paid editor to become the new fully color glossy cover that you must have the money to acquire in order to have a game that is deemed good.</blockquote>\nI seriously fucking hope that doesn't come to pass. <a href="http://RyanMacklin.com/2011/03/ways-to-afford-an-editor/" rel="nofollow">I was hoping that I could explain other ways to pay for an editor, <em>if you need to pay for one</em></a>. Clearly I fucked up on that emphasis.<br/><br/>Next week I'll have a post on my blog that'll go up making a case for not getting editing. While I'm naturally for "hey, people, get editing!" it's not because of some agenda for me to get more work[1], but because I think it's a huge bummer when people years later feel down about their work because they didn't go a few extra steps they could have.<br/><br/>If you think you're going to be happier a few years down by not having an editor, fuck man, don't do it. Whatevs. I haven't met that person yet, though. (And I still think people who charge <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">strangers</span></em> for books that they don't get edited is ethically uncool, but on the other hand why should my mouthy fuck opinion matter to you?)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Recently, there's been a pro-editor movement that is best summed up as "Pay for an editor! The more you pay, the better! It's worth it!" I do realize and accept and appreciate not all pro-editor discussions have taken this tack.</blockquote>\nFuck this in its ear. Man, I have charged some people pretty low. I'll mention a couple:<br/><br/>Elizabeth's Blowback? Because I couldn't finish the job due to scheduling snafu, I told her it was free. And I'm glad that money budgeted was put to other use.<br/><br/>Paul's Penny? Holy shit, Paul got me for a steal. (There was a joke after Don't Lose Your Mind, which I edited, won an ENnie for Best Writing. "I'm glad I got him while he was cheap.")  I won't go into specifics, but you could have made more money per hour finding loose change on an isolated beach than I did on Penny.<br/><br/>(Granted, that was before I understood what I was saying by a rate. These days, depending on the job and the sort of editing needed, I charge around 1.5 to 2 cents a word for a couple different passes.)<br/><br/>Paul's game won Indie Award for Most Innovative last year. He wouldn't have gotten "better" if he had paid me more. It's about two (or more) people matching creatively, not about the fucking money.<br/><br/>I do this because I believe in what I'm doing with folks. I don't take jobs just because I can. I take jobs because people want an ally, and I'm the right person for that particular project. And when I take a job, I personally keep in mind two things:<br/><br/><strong>If I'm the wrong fit for you, you should fire me.</strong><br/><br/>Worried about losing creative control of your project? Man, I can be fired. *bam* There's your control back. And if that's all it takes, you then always have creative control. Just like when you ask your friends for input, and decide which of them is onto something right for your project and which ideas aren't right for this thing. <em>I am aware of and respect the role I'm in.</em><br/><br/><strong>If you're the wrong fit for me, I can walk away.</strong><br/><br/>I don't want to work with just anyone. Editing games is my hobby again. I want my hobby to be fun.<br/><br/>Sure, both of these cause delays in projects. But, uh, life happens?<br/><br/>Anyway, those are my thoughts.<br/><br/>- Ryan<br/><br/>[1] As I'm likely going to stop taking editing jobs, or at least slow the fuck down. Cuz, you know, Mythender and other games in my head deserve to be <em>written</em>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317239/#Comment_317239" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T03:15:49+00:00" title="March 20, 2011  3:15AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2011 3:16AM by Graham.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Joe 50%!<br/><br/>On one hand, there's clearly a sense of making the game as good as you can.

I'm still saying this after 20 years, and I wouldn't hire anyone who didn't. I can give you an idea of how many readers are going to think "that's objectively wrong" rather than "that's a stylistic choice", but at the end of the day, you make your choices based on the effect you want.

I wonder if it's because they've already sold you, just due to the strength of the product / brand / property / company. <br/><br/>I know there have been a few popular games that I had to have but slogging through the text was truly painful. But I did it anyway. They had me, regardless of the game's many limitations. Some companies barely put any effort into reference materials like character sheets because they know the community will do it for them. Dominion has some of the worst layout I've seen in a game in a really long time. Some of the text because of the font color contrasted with the background is almost unreadable. But I didn't learn how to play from the rules. Most people I know didn't. <br/><br/>But for smaller, unknown games\u2026 ironically the ones who probably can least afford it\u2026 editing and other "polish" is probably even more important than it is for larger established games. You have more reasons NOT to play the game than to play it\u2026 no reason to add to those reasons. For example, when I played Misery Bubblegum\u2026 that game blew me away. It was amazing. But I can't figure out the rules that came with the game, even after playing it. And that game is sheer brilliance. The game design behind it deserves in my opinion a much larger audience. Maybe Wizards of the Coast should stop editing and give indie developers their editing budget :-P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317343/#Comment_317343" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T06:39:39+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  6:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John pointed me to this thread. It's always pleasant to find out people are saying nice things about you. Thank you Ryan. I don't do it alone though. With the BWHQ stuff, at least, the copy editors who work with the text after I'm finished with the developmental editing -- people like Rich Forest, Johanna Novales and Christopher Saunders -- make me look really good.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like a self-serving asshole, though, the idea that professional editors are being self-serving when they suggest that game writers hire editors for their projects is extremely funny.<br/><br/>To put it baldly, in the real world I can earn three figures by spending an hour working on an 800-word article. In the RPG world, I can earn low to mid three figures working on a 20,000- to 30,000+-word book. I can earn four figures working on longer games. But even then, the pay is not commensurate with what I could make in an equivalent amount of time working on articles.<br/><br/>If remuneration were a top-level concern for me when working with RPGs, I wouldn't bother doing it. I'd spend that time hunting for contracts that pay more with much less effort.<br/><br/>I can't speak for other editors' experiences, but I suspect their stories would be much the same. We choose to accept the opportunity cost of working on RPGs because we enjoy doing it. We love games and want them to be as good as possible. We want people who pick up a game to be able to play and enjoy it without having to be personally inducted into the mystery cult by someone else who has been taught the secrets of unraveling the game's text.<br/><br/>An editor's job is to help writers better communicate their ideas to their audience.<br/><br/>Does everyone who makes a game need to shell out money for an editor for their game? No. You don't need to shell out for art or layout either. It all depends on your goals and your intended audience.<br/><br/>If your goal is to get your game into the hands of a lot of people who don't have a personal connection to the indie community, and you want them to be able to successfully play your game based only on reading the text, then it's a good idea to get an editor to work on your text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317351/#Comment_317351" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T07:24:24+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  7:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>Does everyone who makes a game need to shell out money for an editor for their game?
