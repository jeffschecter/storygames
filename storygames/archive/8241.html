I hate dealing with lots of separate characters in combat, so for a homebrew system (set in a exotic fantasy post-apoc wasteland) I came up with some "mob rules" to handle fights with large hordes. Nothing fancy, I just treated the horde as an integrated challenge with a unified wound track. And it very effectively made big fights much easier to deal with.<br/><br/>Then last week a friend ran a session of <i>James Band 007</i>, and I noticed how the system had special subsystems for dealing with classic scenes like car chases and seductions. And I really liked how those subsystems simulated the progression of events through a series distinct steps. Then it occurred to me that mob/mook battle rules like my own were conceptually a lot like this sort of progression mechanic. <br/><br/>So I tinkered a bit, and turned my Mob Rules into a more general "extended scene resolution track." It looks something like this:<br/> <br/>D [  ][  ][  ]*[  ][  ][  ] V<br/><br/>And here's how it works. The asterisk represents the median of the track. Left of that splat is the progression to Defeat, right of the splat is the progression to Victory. At the beginning of the scene, the chart is blank. The player rolls dice multiple times, modified in various typical ways, and each time the roll succeeds, the left-most empty box of the Victory track is checked off. Each time the roll fails, the right-most empty box of the Defeat track is checked off. When one of the two tracks is completely filled, the outcome is determined as either Defeat or Victory. The length of each side of the track is variable depending on the situation. And because I like grand titles, I call the mechanic the Road to Glory.<br/><br/>Others have done such a system before, I'm sure. But then I thought it would be neat to accommodate all the typical jockeying for advantage players love by letting separate simple rolls earn bonuses to the progression track rolls. Say the progression is about a duel of rapiers. The character wants to improve his chances by dazzling his opponent's eyes with a lantern. He makes a roll with his "Sneaky Tricks" skill, but if it succeeds it doesn't affect the progression track directly; rather, it adds a bonus to his next roll on the track. I was immediately enamored with this idea, because it rewards both tactical and descriptive detail without requiring actually recording any of it.<br/><br/>Now, here's why I'm posting all this. It then occurred to me that the progression scale could be used for any effort covering any span of time. From a swordfight (a few minutes) to seducing a nun (a few hours) to tracking down a murderer (a few days) to crossing the unknown ocean (months and months). And if I'm dealing with that kind of scale, I might as well let small-scale progression results modify larger scale results, and larger above that ... to as high a level as useful. So, I could simulate the progression of an <i>entire campaign</i> with a single progression chart ("Defeat the Dark Empire"), have sub-goals affecting the main goal under other progression charts ("Repulse the Bloodless Army", "Recover the lost Sun Diamond") and the goals of single adventures covered under progression charts as well ("Rouse the Elven King", "Recruit the Freemen of the March", "Learn the location of the Sun Diamond", "Traverse the Crypt of the Sun Diamond"). Each lower level progression having significance for the higher level progressions.<br/><br/>My point is, that one little mechanic can serve as a single unifying element and organizing factor for large swaths of connected play, and I'm rather pleased to have put it together. All from a disdain for meticulous combat and a single session of old-fashioned Sean Connery suaveness.<br/><br/>Now someone tell me what game already does this so I can stop feeling so smug.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181430/#Comment_181430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T22:38:14+00:00" title="December  3, 2008 10:38PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SotC's minion rules are somewhat similar to this, but to apply it in a more universal fashion reminds me of Progress Quest, only hopefully with more player input.

Rather the group would work out a general goal for the entire campaign to serve as the overall progress track, then just start playing single adventures and over time figure out greater goals to contribute to the ultimate completion of the series.<br/><br/>This feels good to me. In typical conclusion-focused campaigns, my experience has been that play is a bunch of sessions of stuff happening, then the imposition of the mandated resolution regardless of whatever happened before. This bugs me because the individual incidents of play really have no value in terms of final success. Sure, finding the Golden-Gods-Blade conceptually contributes to the downfall of Lord Evildark, but only because the GM says so. I feel much better (and I hope my players do as well) when I can say each effort objectively mattered in the final confrontation.<br/><br/><sub>*though on reflection, that would be interesting for a certain kind of game.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181614/#Comment_181614" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T18:18:14+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  6:18PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's extremely cool and I may steal it, or at least base something on it.<br/><br/>In my work-in-progress (at least, I hope what I occasionally do to it is progress) known as the Pentasystem, I have a concept of "paths" which is broadly similar to your Road to Glory. <br/><br/>A path can be at any scale up to, as you say, an entire extended campaign ("plot-level" paths), but typically there are "attribute-level" paths which change some attribute of a character or the setting within a single scene or two, and "character-level" paths which are goals or dilemmas that characters have and resolve over an extended time period.<br/><br/>At the moment I have progress towards the completion of the paths be all in one direction, but I do like your idea of it being possible to thwart the completion of the path so that it isn't inevitable.<br/><br/>You could skew the number of boxes at each end, of course, as Ralph (Valamir) alludes to. It's as if you were saying, "The likelihood is that he'll succeed, but he could fail" (or, of course, vice versa).<br/><br/>The hierarchical thing is already a part of my concept of paths as well. Steps along a path can themselves be paths of a different level.<br/><br/>Paths have payoffs when you complete them, things you get, but also new challenges that are created by the completion of the path. For the longer paths these are influenced by player decisions (they can  choose to add in positive or negative consequence points that they gain from their die rolls during conflicts).<br/><br/>I was looking for a good way of representing these visually, and your Road to Glory may be at least an important step along that path (heh).<br/><br/>The lightbulb that went off for me with the Road to Glory, though, was that I could take my "path" system and generalize it to use in conflicts too. I recently introduced the idea that you could choose to "attack" or "defend" in conflicts - that is, either choose to move towards your goal or to block your opponent's goal. This mixes well with that. And I even know how to derive the length of the paths for the conflicts. <br/><br/>Characters in the Pentasystem have "motivating attributes" which get them into conflicts, and these (like practically everything else) are rated 1-5. Soooo, you each have a motivating attribute which has got you into this conflict. This determines the length of the conflict path. If my motivating attribute is 3 and yours is 5, you must score 3 successes to get me to yield in the conflict and bring about what you want, whereas I must score 5 successes to get you to yield and bring about what I want.<br/><br/>So thanks, that's clicked another piece into place in my head.<br/><br/>You'll get credit, naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181624/#Comment_181624" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T21:44:19+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  9:44PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2008 9:49PM by JuddG.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>I'm not sure what you mean by that,</blockquote>\nIt was just an amusing aside.

I've got a similar meta-system for one of my games, though the goal structure is less... structured.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn mine, there is an overarching campaign goal. During play, the players will set goals that either advance toward that or detract from that campaign goal. In the midst of those, they will be able to take steps toward completion of their lesser goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's where things are unstructured for me. What counts as a step is very arbitrary, and how many steps are necessary are also somewhat arbitrary (though not entirely). Failing the goal isn't something that's covered by the mechanics, though the text acknowledges that it's possible. If I blatantly steal this mechanic and twist it toward my own ends, it might help tighten up some of the loosey-goosiness at this level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting ramification of this idea is that if applied in a specific fashion, it can act as a pacing mechanic. If you advance, then you've succeeded in something, and you get closer to accomplishing the goal. If you fail at something, some negative twist occurs, but it doesn't necessarily make it any harder to succeed. It can also offer plot immunity to things vital to the goal.. The GM cannot simply kill something off or make it unavailable so long as the goal hasn't been lost. If the goal is lost, then the GM may kill it off, or cut off some approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181649/#Comment_181649" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T07:12:44+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  7:12AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the "nesting" was something the players had to do, in order to manipulate odds?

Because what else is a character's self-improvement but a long term effort with a specific outcome in mind? Set one Road per Skill/Trait the player wants to improve, and allow one roll on one such Road per session. Length and difficulty are set by the degree of new skill they're trying to reach. "Manuevers" would be things like study at a good library, or tutelage under a master, or specific cool bits of description ("I sit under the ice-cold waterfall from dawn to dusk to purify my body for the coming battle"). On first blush, this looks like it'll work really well, and really make character growth feel like a process rather than the "ding" of a new level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181988/#Comment_181988" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T13:56:28+00:00" title="December  7, 2008  1:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The heart of the Pentasystem, for me, is characters and their arcs - I'm following Marshall's Story Made Simple with great interest and doing a lot of head-nodding.<br><br/>Basically a Pentasystem character is defined by what they care about and the things that define them to themselves.
