I have my fronts made up but they are a bit skimpy (and pretty obvious to me now, not the best laid out chapter ever). Any Examples. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262840/#Comment_262840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:34:32+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:34PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read the other threads.

Obviously you'll make sure they have names and good, straightforward motivations, but for some of them take it a step further.  What do they really want, and how are they planning to get it?  If no one (a PC) got in their way, what would they do first?  What next?  What would it lead to?  You don't need to plot it all out, but maybe give them a countdown clock in your head, ticking like a little bomb.  This will help you you to see good connections to PCs as their paths cross, make it easier for you to "announce future badness" and generally help make things seem real.<br/><br/>You might also sketch out a quick relationship map between the players and NPCs, looking particularly for PC-NPC-PC triangles.  This might be best done once the players are at the table, after they've identified which NPCs are in their gangs and so forth.<br/><br/>I found it really useful to use references to better visualize the details.  For the key NPCs, maybe think of an actor that might play him in your movie- I had a biker boss that looked and talked like a scarred-up <a href="http://static.tvguide.com/MediaBin/Galleries/Imported/BioPix/A/bio12/keith_david01.jpg" rel="nofollow">Kieth David</a>, and a mad scientist-type Angel as played by John Malkovich. Knowing that helped me get into their skin and made them more real for the players.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, as the book says, make maps.  The scenario has one, but make some more, or better yet, get the players to draw them.  Have the Hardholder player sketch out the compound, identifying strengths and weaknesses.  What did this place used to be?  Where do people get water?  Where's the outhouse?  Where do they get power, if they have any?<br/><br/>Think about stuff- what kinds of things might players find for sale?  What kinds of things do people use for easy exchange- poker chips?  furs?  old world plastic credit cards?  Think about some things that players might want or need that aren't weapons, so you can dangle it in front of them.  Get the players to help.<br/><br/>As the scenario says, create custom moves.  Even if they players never end up making those moves, I felt like they were useful to think about, helpful in understanding the world.  There are good examples around, and I'd be glad to share mine. <br/><br/>Anyway, those things were useful to me.  Have a good time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262904/#Comment_262904" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T19:56:49+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  7:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks will do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
