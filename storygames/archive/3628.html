If you voted before 1:10 PM EDT you will need to vote again. Our apologies for the inconvenience.</b><br/><br/>If you were an early adopter on the voting, please take the time to vote again.  I'd hate for us being on the ball with the Summer Revolution stuff to turn out to be a reason we *don't* get heard.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
