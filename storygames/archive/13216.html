I think OSR has pretty much achieved what it set out to do:<br/>-to revive and preserve the "old" game<br/>-to continue publishing material for it and to support it<br/><br/>So I don't think there's anything "next" for OSR other than to continue doing this, in bigger and better style (see the recent merging of efforts by Raggi and McKinney).<br/><br/>On the other hand, even the DIY, the house-rules, variants, free-wheeling approach are somewhat antithetic to Gary Gygax's original vision (he often derided "house rules", even forbade them, mocked the "amateur press" and so on). It's about people's <i>gaming</i>, not the actual game. Many authors (specifically Raggi and McKinney, mentioned above) are pushing their own visions. The inclusion of elves, dwarves and halflings in LotFP was a necessity of the fact that it's an retro-clone, but then again, it's very much not in line with LotFP's aesthetic, imho. The demi-humans should totally be thrown out. Likewise, the systematized, list-based, pseudo-scientific Vancian magic system seems very much contrary to Raggi's presentation of magic. He argues that it doesn't matter, since magic is, well, magic, and doesn't make sense, but I think his talk of magic as something wild, strange, unique, non-repeatable, non-scientific etc. goes very much contrary to how magic actually works in LotFP. There's only so far that mere colour can go. "System" is "not limited to" rules, yes, but it is also "including".<br/><br/>Therefore I can totally see that certain sensibilities of the old-school will get re-incorporated, revived, pushed forward, reinvented etc, in a different framework*. But that won't be the OSR anymore, I think.<br/><br/>*In fact it's already happening big-time. Red Box Hack, Old School Hack, Dungeon World (even Apocalypse World, to a degree), Dungeon Slayers, Shadow, Sword &amp; Spell, Storming the Wizard's Tower...all these are games that are not actually retro-clones of the boxed sets, but are leaking old-school flavour. Even the 4E Red Box and Essentials products are exhibiting some nostalgic sensibilities (Mike Mearls is a big time oD&amp;D/AD&amp;D gamer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297442/#Comment_297442" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T13:18:52+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  1:18PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like conversion rules from old school games to some of the stuff you mention, Gregor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297451/#Comment_297451" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T13:35:20+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  1:35PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Gregor,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Hey, Paul, I really like that thread (or better, the idea behind that thread), but frankly, I think it belongs here much more than on RPGnet's "design" subforum (the fact that only I replied is probably an indicator).</blockquote>\nI was hoping some of the older members of RPG.net who came of age as gamers in the mid-70s would have something to say about the social dynamics of gaming then, with old school games, vs. now, with OSR games.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297470/#Comment_297470" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T14:14:13+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  2:14PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, if you mean OldGeezer, TheLizard and folks like that, I don't think they don't go to Development &amp; Design much if at all.

Now Raggi has also announced that LotFP will be releasing a supplement by Zak Sabbath of "D&amp;D with porn stars" fame.<br/><br/>The reaction in the OSR seems split right down the middle.

That's the kind of totally non-compromising attitude towards any sort of change I've mentioned. It is likely anything "new" for OSR, will be expunged from the movement and it will remain on the fringes, or become its own thing.

Speaking as someone who quite regularly gets pilloried for being far more strident than I actually am, I can assure you that the people who are actually involved in the old school renaissance by producing stuff, rather than sitting on the sidelines and kvetching, are among the most open-minded, flexible, and creative hobbyists I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

I suspect that's why so many people misunderstand or misconstrue a lot of what I have to say.\n<blockquote>I follow a handful of OSR blogs and such and I know that most of the OSR crowd are a nice, enthusiastic and open-minded sort and it's a pleasure following their stuff.

By and large, most of the negativity comes from a handful of people on a couple of forums that are generally quite skeptical of and/or opposed to the OSR for one reason or another rather than from people actually involved in the scene. <br/><br/>Places like Finarvyn's Original D&amp;D Discussion are much more representative of what the OSR is about than, for example, Dragonsfoot or the Knights &amp; Knaves Alehouse, both of which have very narrow (and often dogmatic) interests with regards to old school gaming. If there'd been an uproar on Finarvyn's boards about <i>Carcosa</i> (or Zak's Playing D&amp;D with Porn Stars) -- which there <i>wasn't</i> -- I think that'd be a better indicator that the negativity was widespread, because the crowd there is much more directly involved in advancing the OSR in various ways. My feeling remains that most (though, sadly, not all) the tempests in teapots swirling around the old school scene were manufactured by people <i>outside or opposed to it</i> rather than within it.

It's what happens when a bunch of pre-teen kids take games that were made by &amp; for mature adults to do collaborative improv, and use them as the turf for peer-group dominance hierarchy battles. I teach a D&amp;D; afterschool class for kids age 8-11, and I'm ready to attest that kids at the upper end of that range will turn anything into a struggle for superiority (although they're particularly drawn to 4E because of all the quantitative ways it offers to show how your guy is better than someone else's guy).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeen in a certain light, all the rest of the history of RPGs follows from that moment when kids became the dominant market and, eventually, kids who grew up playing that way designed RPGs to fix the problems that came from their primal social landscape. Every occasion for creative GM adjucation becomes a bitter fight due to lack of mature consensus-building skills --&gt; hundreds of pages of  tightly defined universal mechanics covering every case. Players don't want to care about anything because it'll give a vindictive DM a handle to screw them with --&gt; systems for explicitly defining your character's goals and beliefs and delimiting the ways they arise in play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.canonpuncture.com/?p=1645" rel="nofollow">As I explained on Canon Puncture</a>, I see the defining mechanics of old-school as random encounters, morale checks, reaction rolls, and tables for random generation of treasures, dungeons, courtesans, etc. Games that give a big role to these subvert a DM's ability to tell a pre-planned story, and instead encourage them to get into an open mindset where unexpected inputs from the dice or the characters' actions and reactions can be incorporated into an ongoing collaboration of awesomeness that the DM discovers &amp; is surprised by just like the players. To my mind, it's post-AD&amp;D; 1E editions that successively increase the DM's ability to drive their personal vision of awesome, whether that's by advising the DM to ignore wandering monster checks, fudge dice rolls, or skip the "un-fun parts", or by replacing mechanics that create unpredictability with ones that let you more reliably quantify how much of a party's resources a pre-planned encounter will drain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn't there, but <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/dd-was-a-wargame-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means/" rel="nofollow">from my brief conversations with  Arneson and Wesely</a> I get the sense that the truly old-school, pre-Barrowcliffe social landscape was populated by adults (Gygax was 33, Arneson was 24) who'd learned how to create social cohesion and collaborative adjucation by playing wargames like Braunstein that had imaginative systems instead of rules, or like Chainmail that had a parcel of sub-systems meant to be situationally adopted, modified, or swapped out for new inventions as the players desired. While Gygax eventually went on to drive his own personal vision of awesome via AD&amp;D;'s standardized rules and Greyhawk's solitary world-creation, all the evidence suggests that Arneson's original campaign was highly collaborative; the action was driven by player initiative in settling baronies and pursuing the individual "special interests" that turned gold into experience, and the famous villains of Blackmoor were <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://blackmoormystara.blogspot.com/2010/08/stephen-rock-first-d-arch-villain.html" rel="nofollow">created by players who Arneson approached to contribute their creativity</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the most exciting work the OSR has been doing at places like Fin's OD&amp;D; boards is to make explicit some of the assumptions and approaches of this earliest style of play. I personally don't want to see a set of mechanics regulating the social landscape - I much prefer what Trollsmyth calls <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://trollsmyth.blogspot.com/2009/11/masques-machinations-building-neo.html" rel="nofollow">the neo-classical approach</a>, where the central activity of play (a mutual &amp; always-surprising group creation of awesomeness) flourishes unconstrained in the space suggested by the peripheral mechanics that are defined (in this case, the kind of random encounter tables and town-stocking procedures that Ry describes upthread).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to choose just one thing that new-school approaches could to contribute to the OSR, it's the practice of calling out and explicating what the existing rules are meant to do and how you can use them in play to achieve the desired effect. Ry's description of when to use wandering monsters is a good example, as is LotFP's referee rulebook, as are the Apocalypse World MC guidelines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298799/#Comment_298799" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-29T15:39:24+00:00" title="October 29, 2010  3:39PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            :claps:<br><br>I think there's something in my eye.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski" title="James Maliszewski"><img alt="James Maliszewski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski">James Maliszewski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299367/#Comment_299367" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T15:45:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  3:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2010 3:46PM by James Maliszewski.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>Paul, I agree that<em>The Elfish Gene</em>is a very important glimpse of a social landscape, but I think what it's showing us is the birth of trad and the eclipse of old-school. It's what happens when a bunch of pre-teen kids take games that were made by &amp; for mature adults to do collaborative improv, and use them as the turf for peer-group dominance hierarchy battles.</blockquote>\nJust so. <br><br>I'm curious, though, is this distinction between "old school" and "trad" something that's been discussed elsewhere? Being a lover of fine distinctions, I see a lot of value in it.\n<blockquote>To my mind, it's post-AD&amp;D 1E editions that successively increase the DM's ability to drive their personal vision of awesome, whether that's by advising the DM to ignore wandering monster checks, fudge dice rolls, or skip the "un-fun parts", or by replacing mechanics that create unpredictability with ones that let you more reliably quantify how much of a party's resources a pre-planned encounter will drain.</blockquote>\nWhat's interesting, though, is that increasing the DM's ability to drive his "personal vision of awesome" -- what a delightful phrase! -- was as much a result of <i>player</i> desires as it was the DM's. Emphasizing the DM's ability to implement a personal vision in a campaign was a means to ensure that there was at least a coherent vision of some sort beyond the faithless whimsy of the dice. Indeed, I've come to suspect that a great many of the stories about "killer DMs" are in fact stories about DMs who trusted the dice to do a lot of heavy lifting in the campaign.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299370/#Comment_299370" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T16:10:46+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  4:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2010 4:12PM by Teataine.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding trad vs. old-school I don't think I've ever seen it discussed in this way explicitly, but I feel it's very much implied in a lot of discussions.

I think (emphasize 'think') the real trouble started when <br><br>1. the DM's "personal vision of awesome" was replaced by published materials. Official metaplots, published settings and the like, and...<br>2. rules upon rules were added to ensure "mechanical coherence" in addition to the "coherence of vision", because the game became more and more about competition. More crunch gave players something to fall back on to when the GM's fiat was deemed "unfair" (or vice-versa, when a DM was accused of being too hard, he could point at the book and say "it says so in here).<br><br>In both occasions, the official, sanctioned version became "safe" and reliable, whereas people seemingly lost the ability to really create something collaboratively.<br/><br/>In fact, I perceive a very strong trend from oD&amp;D to 4E that's consistently removing any really dangerous or "punitive" mechanics (such as save or die) and "balancing" encounters to the point where a single encounter in 4E is specifically intended to draw out a number of the party's resources, but not kill or defeat the party. It's very much about "playing it safe". While there are obvious benefits to this, it's obvious that the game had to turn its back on other aspects to achieve this goal.<br/><br/>James, if I said that one important achievement of contemporary design was to create dice mechanics that are reliably fun - that is, that the dice are actually a contributing, creative element, instead of a being a destructive element of "faithless flimsy" - would you say that is something the OSR could take away from modern games? A system where the DM doesn't have to ignore the dice in order to preserve the coherence of the game?

Why?  Because failure is ok.<br/><br/>Old school is in some ways nearer to indie than it is to trad, and one way it is is that you don't roll unless you're cool with the consequences.  In old school, it's fine for the PCs to lose.  It's fine for them to have to run away.  If the dice are rolled, that's because the players have at some point exposed themselves to the risk the dice represent, and so the roll stands.<br/><br/>A game where the GM ignores dice rolls because they don't fit the narrative is not an old school game.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that in OSR terms a game with a narrative is not an old school game.<br/><br/>In old school (which wasn't by any means the only way people used to play, for me the old school is actually fairly new) the only narrative is that which emerges organically from play,  There is no GM plot to spoil.  There is no PC destiny to be frustrated.  There's simply a world, characters in it and stuff that happens.<br/><br/>James, would you agree or would you have another take?<br/><br/>Edit:  As an addendum, I'd say the role of the GM in old school is best captured by the term given to the role in Traveller.

In discussions on rpg.net and the Forge about five years ago it definitely meant games produced from the post-Runequest/Champions/GURPS quasi-consensus about what constituted 'good design', which found its most successful popular realization in the White Wolf games in the early nineties. Because AD&amp;D; 2e had moved somewhat towards this model, not in its core rules but in the splats and in many sim/story oriented supplements to it, it was fairly easy to include <i>fin de siecle </i>D&amp;D; under this umbrella.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course the problem is that those games are quite distinct from the great variety of seventies RPGs that are actually in a technical sense even more 'traditional' because older - D&amp;D;, T&amp;T;, B&amp;B;, Traveller, Boot Hill, etc. And so it sometimes was the case that once we dinosaurs finally figured out how these computer thingies worked we said, 'wait a minute! these folks are saying our games suck and they don't even know how they work!' Some, like me, stuck around, learned what you folks were talking about, and gained a greater appreciation for the possibilities of our hobby, even if we didn't necessarily go over to what some of you folks were doing. Others freaked out, got pissed off, and, well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut 'traditional games' doesn't really mean anything and probably shouldn't be used without qualification. In the seventies there were games like Runequest and TFT that pushed towards the 'eighties-nineties trad' model. And some of the most interesting designs of the eighties - personal favorites include James Bond 007 and Paranoia - actually were not in the 'eighties-nineties trad' model at all, and elements of those games I believe were part of the creative ferment that led into the oughties 'story games' renaissance - they point towards different ways of doing things even if a lot of what's in them mechanically roughly suits older models.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski" title="James Maliszewski"><img alt="James Maliszewski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski">James Maliszewski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299433/#Comment_299433" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T07:28:22+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  7:28AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2010 7:30AM by James Maliszewski.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>So, maybe I'm reading him wrong, but it seems to me that he's saying DM fiat should ensure the dice don't ruin the game, yes?

If Frodo dies, he dies and that's what happened. <i>That</i> is our story. If we are interested in the story at all.<br/><br/>Then we get the, as you say, DM-as-storyteller. Why this happened, I can't say for sure. I have a lot of theories, but I don't want to go into in here. We can talk about it later, maybe. Your explanation is as good as any. But it certainly happened. Let's say it's the dissatisfaction with Frodo dying. <br/>Player: "Frodo can't die! DM, you suck!"  <br/>DM: "Ok, ok, I'll ignore the dice."<br/><br/>Suddenly, we didn't have a <i>Referee</i> anymore, but a <i>"Storyteller"</i>. So what happens? You get a guy, probably a teenager and tell him that he's <i>The Storyteller</i> and that he has <i>Absolute Authority</i> over what happens in the game. Yeah, you can see where this is going...Suddenly, the GM is not just refereeing but orchestrating his own private show, and the players are now helpless marionettes. <br/><br/>It's very similar to what happened with the malevolent, tyrannical DM, except he was killing characters and now he's using them as pawns in his great epic. Not all GMs are like that, and it doesn't have to be like that at all. Both are examples of dysfunctional play within a <i>style of play</i>.<br/><br/>So, now, when you say "story" a lot of gamers react in regard to that experience. They don't want "story" to take precedence, because that's "railroading" and "nothing unexpected can happen" and it reminds them of DMPCs and suffering through their DMs' personal epics.<br/><br/>But <i>Story Now</i> which a lot of indie games are doing is not about that at all. Some of its strongest mandates are "<i>play to find out what happens</i>" and "<i>don't plan ahead</i>" and "<i>don't have a solution in mind</i>". It's Story <i>Now</i> because it's happening now, right here, at the table, as we play. There's no pre-determined DM plot or anything. If Frodo dies, that's our story, if he destroys the ring, that's our story.<br/><br/>This is why "indie games" have a lot more in common with "old-school" than "trad" if we want to use those definitions. I could be seen as a full circle, or more aptly, a horseshoe. We got back to the source, in a way.<br/><br/>Vincent once talked about this using Bruce Willis movies as a metaphor. If we're playing Die Hard, he beats the bad guys and gets the girl, right? There can be no other outcome, because that's the story of Die Hard. But what old-school does and what indie storygaming does, we let the dice tell the story. Maybe the dice roll differently, and he doesn't get the girl and gets shot and we're actually playing 12 monkeys. The dice tell us what movie we're playing. We don't know where we're going to end up, right? The DM/GM/MC/whatever is just the "reporter" of what happens. He's impartial, he's just holding things together.<br/><br/>So far so good?<br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Cailithena">@Cailithena</a>, my understanding of "more traditional" in this context is "old-school": D&amp;D (up to the red box, more or less), T&amp;T, Traveller..."less traditional" or simply "traditional" is almost everything else in between, up to the 00's. I think we can start talking about "indie" as a specific <i>thing</i> only after '05. Of course such chronological distributions are not terribly useful if used willy-nilly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299460/#Comment_299460" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T10:10:55+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 10:10AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were actually two kinds of "killer DMs." You had to listen carefully to how the DM is being talked about to determine which kind.<br/><br/>There was the "My DM's a killer DM, but we managed to beat his dungeon!" type, that people enjoyed.<br/><br/>Then there was the kind I also label "Shigawire Morgan DM" after watching people play in Morgan's dungeon once. The entry passage had a pit trap with a shigawire mesh screen in it. "Oops, you fell in, a fine mist of blood and flesh falls to the bottom of the pit." His dungeon was full of traps, and I watched a group of players struggle to make any progress whatsoever for about an hour. Finally they were all dead.

For example, I used to complain about TARGA's name - for me the Traditional Adventure Role-Playing Game Association would support non-electronic tabletop gaming, whereas as you say for others that'd mean White Wolf games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a neologism, "trad" has the advantage of not meaning anything so folks can make it mean what they like. I do think it has a useful and reasonably wide-spread connotation of a certain kind of "fudge dice rolls if they get in the way of the story the DM creates from a pre-decided text and the players follow along or else there is no game" playstyle. I will defer to Deliverator's suggestion that it's been hashed out here and at nerdNYC, since I get this usage directly from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure that "trad games" is as useful - here we've gone and introduced a word with actual meaning! I think that it's important to identify playstyle, not rules, as the thing we're talking about: Deliverator correctly identified me as an old-school GM after playing in the playtest of a 4E D&amp;D; convention scenario I'd written. One reason nerdNYC is a good environment for hashing things out is that, being a big &amp; diverse local community, we can participate in one another's games and experience playstyle directly; as Zak Smith has said, normally on the internet we only have "what rules were you using" as a touchstone to talk about, which leads to problems because two people can play the same game very differently. (Maybe especially so for trad games?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say that some games fit my playstyle better than others - it was a natural fit to incorporate Apocalypse World moves into the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=339.0" rel="nofollow">carousing</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=467.0" rel="nofollow">in-town</a> segments of my OD&amp;D; campaign, so you could say it's an "old-school game". (Contrariwise, you could also say that my old-school playstyle is shaped in large part by exposure to ideas from "indie games" floating around the nerdNYC environment.) And playing Rifts at a nerdNYC gameday <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=46237" rel="nofollow">was not a good fit for my style</a>, so I'd be happy to call it a "trad game". Overall I think you wouldn't be far wrong if you wanted to define old-school/trad/indie games as "those systems which feel natural to GMs with the respective playstyles", perhaps with the caveat that "system does matter" is a defining feature of the indie playstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nkomradebob, from what I understand Professor Barker's group is still playing a distinctly RPG campaign with roots that go right back to Arnesonian wargaming. For sure, I wouldn't have become involved in D&amp;D; if it hadn't been marketed to kids, so I find this hard to regret; as Elvis Costello says, "it was a fine idea at the time, now it's a brilliant mistake".<br/>\n<br/>\nJames, overall I agree with you about Frodo but I'd hesitate to doubt that back in the day there really were lots of "killer DMs" whose satisfaction came from sadistic displays of their power over PCs. At Gen Con, David Wesely told me that they recognized early on that lots of people didn't have what it took to be good referees. Given a big, sudden influx of new players, it stands to reason that there would be a higher percentage of ego-tripping jerks than we'd find amongst contemporary roleplayers, since most of us nowadays have been doing it for decades - time enough for evolution to sift out those DMs who can't retain players or find new ones due to their toxic reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience helping 8-11 year olds run RPGs, who I think have the same issues as all new players but just closer to the surface 'cause they're kids, you can get killer railroad GMing from lack of experience and from egotistical involvement. Lack of experience: all other examples of narratives you've ever been exposed to have a beginning, middle, and end with only one path between each of them; it takes lots of play to figure out RPGs aren't like that. Egotism: could be "I am automatically the hero of any story, you are a killer DM for humiliating me by allowing me to fail", but could also be "I am the storyteller here, I am automatically in control, your refusal to appreciate the path I have laid out for you is humiliating and I will kill your character to punish you for not falling in line."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299495/#Comment_299495" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T12:20:49+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 12:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much on the same page as you, Tavis.

It's what happens when a bunch of pre-teen kids take games that were made by &amp; for mature adults to do collaborative improv, and use them as the turf for peer-group dominance hierarchy battles. I teach a D&amp;D afterschool class for kids age 8-11, and I'm ready to attest that kids at the upper end of that range will turn anything into a struggle for superiority (although they're particularly drawn to 4E because of all the quantitative ways it offers to show how your guy is better than someone else's guy).</blockquote>\nHmm. Barrowcliffe is three years older than I am. He was twelve when he started playing OD&amp;D at that war game club, with an older DM. I was the same age when I started playing Holmes box D&amp;D. Yes, there was adolescent dysfunction when he played with his friends "Rat" and "Chigger". But his one-on-one gaming with his best friend Billy was different. From my reading Billy was his M.A.R. Barker, his Dave Hargrave, the guru who showed him the awesome. I think Barrowcliffe had the adult experience of OD&amp;D from his gaming with Billy. And my own adolescent gaming with Holmes box D&amp;D and AD&amp;D1e was very similar. Despite bringing D&amp;D to my friends, I fell into one-on-one gaming with my best friend Rob as DM. And Rob definitely had his own vision. He loved Planet of the Apes, so town guards were always gorillas with names like Urko. I had a dwarf thief named Fingon who never made it past third level due to level drain encounters with wights and such. Fingon had a series of sidekicks, thieves and magic users, who he never managed to keep alive for very long. The games often featured preposterous and elaborate shortbow battles involving my character, his henchmen, and dozens of opponents. One particularly dramatic bowfight was on a fast moving river in the jungle among three or four dugout canoes, each with oarsmen and bowmen, that shifted in relative position as crewmen were killed.

One-on-one gaming is great that way; having more minds you need to communicate with means you mean you need more common ground, less room for crazy Kool-Aid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids in my afterschool class like to begin every adventure with "you fall into a pit." My son's dungeon had the top level where you could find treasures, fight a purple worm, or sneak past other sleeping worms to find secret doors, a mine cart, and another shaft that led down to a pile of coal that had coal monsters that would set themselves on fire and attack. If you went down the whirlpools surrounding the coal pile, or into a hole in the wall, you'd get to a giant cavern filled with dinosaurs (imagine a long list of the specific dino species here).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the players was a skateboard called Boinge; he had a toy skateboard that was sorta the right size to be a miniature, so that was his PC. We encouraged the kids to invent their own character's powers theoretically according to the 4E power structure but mostly inspired by superheroes and hey, Kool-Aid! One of the girls' PC's powers are Crumble, Potato, and Shoggy.  James_Nostack says he's seen Crumble used to make things decay, and after Boinge went down the hole to dino-land and we ran out of time she dropped Potato down the shaft to blow up the dungeon and seal away the dinosaurs, but we are still dying to see what Shoggy does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski" title="James Maliszewski"><img alt="James Maliszewski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski">James Maliszewski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299513/#Comment_299513" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T13:10:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  1:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>So, in old-school, the original GM is the impartial arbiter.

My point, perhaps badly expressed, was not that the "killer DM" was a myth, but rather that a lot of gamers' memories of having suffered under a killer DM are exaggerated. Much of what they're remembering as "killer" behavior wasn't at all like the stuff that Frank Filz or Dave Wesely were describing. Instead, they were dissatisfied and frustrated with the fact that their cool character got killed by a fire beetle in the Caves of Chaos before he had a chance to achieve his imagined Great Destiny and that dissatisfaction and frustration was directed at the DM for his lack of interest in fudging things to achieve that end. Such a DM was a "killer" one primarily by omission and ought not to be lumped into the same category as the ego-tripping sadist of legend.<br><br>Ultimately, my point was simply that there was likely no plague of killer DMs, even after the hobby opened up to include more young people. Much of the unhappiness directed toward these DMs was in fact unhappiness occasioned by the fact that RPGs weren't designed to reliably produce coherent and satisfying stories, something a lot of players -- and not just younger ones -- expected from them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299538/#Comment_299538" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T16:02:12+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  4:02PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I would like to continue using "trad" as a neologism however, until we find a better word.</blockquote>\nHere's one vote for taking it to some quiet, pleasant place and shooting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299539/#Comment_299539" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T16:02:23+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  4:02PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2010 4:03PM by D-503.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>So, in old-school, the original GM is the impartial arbiter.

I just wanted to clarify that this is what I meant.  <br><br>I'm going to pick up on a couple of things from my perspective, as I regard myself largely as an old school GM, in case it's helpful to you.<br><br>For me, fiat does not override the dice.  I generally have a vision for the games I run, not a plot, but an idea of the sort of game it is.<br><br>So, the next one I'm running the characters are rogues and adventurers in 16th Century Florence.<br><br>I have expectations about what that means which I've commuicated to the players.  But, once we start, it's our game and they may and hopefully will take it places I haven't imagined.<br/><br/>Where does fiat come in?  Fiat is the most powerful and beneficial tool in my arsenal as a GM.  When nobody knows what will happen or what will matter in play, clearly we can't have rules for everything.  For other reasons I wouldn't want that anyway.  So, many things will come up for which there are no rules.<br/><br/>I, as GM, will make a call.  Now, I dislike the word fiat in part because it implies to me arbitrariness, that I make my call in a vacuum.  I don't.  If a situation arises, players may make suggestions, I may ask what people think, but after taking any inputs that are offered or asked for I'll make a call and we'll go on.  <br/><br/>What I don't do is override the dice.  The dice fall where they may.  When a player lets something go to the dice, they're saying that the conflict is important enough to them for failure to be acceptable.  That's why I don't worry about PCs getting ganked by unimportant guards.  Why are you in a fight to the death with an unimportant guard?  If you are, you accept you might get pointlessly killed.<br/><br/>So, fiat is to allow the GM to come up with consistent rulings that support the shared vision of the world (which is built on, but not constricted to, the GM's vision).  GM fiat is not for overriding the dice, that way lies storygaming in the White Wolf sense.<br/><br/>One last thing, for me rules getting out of the way is a positive good.  It's not that I don't believe there are rules which can support a particular style of play or experience, it's that for what I want the most effective way to achieve that is rules' transparency.  A very common theory error is to say "ah, that's because you haven't found the right supportive ruleset yet".  Iff you find yourself thinking that, I'd strongly recommend listening more to why people want the rules to fade away.  It's not because they don't matter.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299545/#Comment_299545" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T16:43:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  4:43PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Maliszewski</cite><br/>That's the ideal anyway.

"Story Now" and "Narrativism" and things like that are very unfortunate names for what "indie storygames" (or whatever you want to call them) do, because they have nothing to do with story as it was understood in RPGs roughly 1980-2005. So, basically good thing, but percived negatively in the light of past understanding. Ok.<br/><br/>So the way we run games is the same (no pre-planned plot, railroading, etc.). This is the familiarity.\n<blockquote>I'll admit to some dissatisfaction with comparing a RPG campaign to a movie, mostly because it seems to assume there's an end point at which everything coheres into something recognizably "story-like."

Now, maybe I'm interpreting the metaphor too strongly, I don't know, but alarm bells go off in my head when comparisons to movies or TV shows or even most books are brought up.<br/><br/>Can you elaborate some more on this?</blockquote>\nYes, absolutely.<br/><br/>So far we've established that we call "Story Now" and "Old-School" have a lot in common. I mentioned the horseshoe earlier. We've come almost full circle back, but it doesn't connect completely.<br/><br/>Here the similarity ends. One thing is, we still have consideration for telling good stories, only (I say "we" in the broadest sense possible, not referring to a "school" or "clique") and stories do need story arcs (beginning, middle, end). Also, this doesn't mean a campaign has to end, but that maybe a character completes his story.<br/><br/>Old-School is "a bunch of stuff that happens". I call that Story After. Stuff happens and then you tell stories about it, much like real life ("So then we tricked the gnolls to fight the goblins for us! It was awesome!").<br/><br/>What "we" do uses many of the same techniques, but it's Story Now. We want to get to the meat of the thing at the table, not after. Telling a good story is indeed a concern. It's just that we don't prepare it in advance.<br/><br/>The movie metaphor IS strong, so it's probably right that alarms are going off in your head, but it's there to illustrate a point.<br/><br/>So these new games we play are designed so that they can relatively reliably produce coherent and satisfying stories, with none of the railroad, none of the dice fudging and all of the "open world" freedom of old-school. Except that "producing stories" actually becomes a fairly clear goal, instead of just something that happens in retrospect.<br/><br/>You want me to talk more about that?<br/><br/>In your reply to Tavis you also say\n<blockquote>Much of what they're remembering as "killer" behavior wasn't at all like the stuff that Frank Filz or Dave Wesely were describing. Instead, they were dissatisfied and frustrated with the fact that their cool character got killed by a fire beetle in the Caves of Chaos before he had a chance to achieve his imagined Great Destiny and that dissatisfaction and frustration was directed at the DM for his lack of interest in fudging things to achieve that end.</blockquote>\nI'll use this example in an attempt to break down three possible styles.<br/><br/>In and Old-School game, the character getting killed is because he was unlucky, stupid, not trying hard enough, etc. Correct? Better luck next time, roll up a new character. I believe this aspect of old-school play was later emphasized in Step on Up play (the second "style" next to Story Now). Character death and survival is a mixture of player skill and some character skill and some luck. When things get tough, it's about the challenge and smart choices.<br/><br/>In Story Now, it's no problem if the character dies, we had no big plans for him, right? We're playing to find out what happens. But we usually want it to be meaningful, so a lot of games make it so that death is not completely random. The player is usually aware when a character is facing death, so it's a meaningful choice "Do I/my character care enough about this thing to risk death?". When the character dies it's usually not because the player made a bad choice, but because he felt that was a cool/good thing to do. Just an example, it doesn't have to be about death, and death is often easy in these games, too. The rules support this.<br/><br/>Now, what that imaginary player in your example is expecting is a third style, Right to Dream. He has a certain vision, fantasy, Dream. He wants things to go a certain way, his character to be <i>like this</i> and he wants <i>that</i> in his game, but maybe not <i>that</i>. Yeah? He's got a vision of how things should go and things should be. This is a legit playstyle, but very problematic. I find it it works in two occasions, either<br/>a) the GM and the players prepare a story beforehand, and just run it through (you're probably thinking "how can this be fun?")<br/>or <br/>b) the GM prepares a story and the player create their characters, then the GM runs the story without infringing on the characters, and the players just revel in the guise of their characters, participating in the story, but never actually collaborating, never driving the action and never doing unexpected stuff, just following the GM's hints (and they should be ok with it)<br/><br/><br/>If we're still understanding each other (I think I get everything you're saying and agree with it), I can talk more about how some indie/Story Now games achieve coherence of fiction without railroading. I expect you will find it's mostly tricks good GMs have been using for ages, but codified into actual rules. (So, on that front, not really different from functional Old-School play. Only the attitude towards creating story is different (now vs. after))                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299547/#Comment_299547" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T16:58:45+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  4:58PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max, great.

That's a big deal.  There is no thematic premise addressed through play.  There is no engagement with issues of personal importance to the players.  My guard example, the player decides if it's worth his character dying for but he does so in, oh, bugger, what are all the stances called again?<br/><br/>Ok, in old school the player interfaces with the game world via his character.  He has no meta level involvement.  He cannot introduce his character to a scene because it would make dramatic sense or be cool.  He does not act against his character's desires because his interest is in seeing the character go through hell and back again.  He plays his character.<br/><br/>It's often said in story game circles that the character does not exist.  Obviously that's true.  However, in old school it's not the whole truth because you act as if they did and what is important is what is important to the character, not what is important to the player.<br/><br/>Obviously the player chose what's important to the character, but it's still a different take.<br/><br/>Authorial stance is incompatible with old school play.  Hah, remembered one of the stance terms I was looking for.<br/><br/>Equally, the idea that story is merely that which happened, devoid of thematic content, is fundamentally at odds with story gaming.<br/><br/>We've established what we have in common.  The next step is exploring what we don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299549/#Comment_299549" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T17:13:55+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  5:13PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the most part, I'm grooving on what you're saying, Teataine.

I think though that while I wouldn't enjoy it, one could have functional play in which the players experience a predetermined GM plot.  In fact, I'd say that's probably the most common form of gaming and is often highly functional.<br/><br/>The problem that's starting to come up here is where I've often seen theory go wrong.  The key thing is not to start fitting what people say into story now, right to dream and so on.  The key thing is to listen to what they're saying.  It may not fit those categories.  If it does, that's great, but more listening and less categorising is key.<br/><br/>Old school play is not story now.  It has elements in common, but it's absolutely not the same thing.  Playing through a preplanned plot is one reason to play.  Playing to explore is another.  Challenge a third.  Exploration can be split into character and setting, and the two may not go well together.  And so on.<br/><br/>Now, all this ultimately may fit into three categories, whatever.  But if people (and you didn't) start putting stuff in boxes they stop listening, and Teataine has good insights which is why I'd encourage him and others to leave labels aside and say instead "what do you want from this play?"  Labelscan stop you hearing the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299553/#Comment_299553" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T17:45:28+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  5:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think labels are useless, though. You just have to use them precisely and thoughtfully. RTD, Story Now, and Step on Up are coherent and useful labels that (in my experience) talk about real things. Railroading is similarly a useful label for a real thing. I just don't think that RTD and railroading are the same thing. That's all I was objecting to. (And yeah, degenerate was unnecessarily harsh. I've played in a very good railroaded campaign, and enjoyed it.

I know early on there were discussions on the Forge that pinned down Right to Dream as "double exploration", but I'm not buying that. I'm using it more or less the way Vincent has been using it, that is when certain elements or functions of the fiction are sacrosanct and imutable (unless the dream deems them mutable). But I don't want to have a discussion about what RtD is and isn't here. If you want we can start another thread for that. It would just muddle the waters here. So for the purposes of this thread:<br/><br/>Peter, Max: I don't actually care about labels, we can drop them. I was using them as shorthand for playstyles I have actually experienced and participated in. If you can relate to those experiences and recognize them, then we can agree to call them by some common name, if you have other experiences, I'd be happy to hear them.<br/><br/>An aside, Peter: Railroading can happen in any game, I'm not equating it to RtD. But it is very specific to dysfunctional play where the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GM</span> has a RtD agenda and others don't or have a different dream. Can we agree on that?<br/><br/>Ok, back to Max. Ok, differences, yes. There is no story now, I think that's the biggest deal. <br/><b><i>*the player decides if it's worth his character dying for but he does so in [authorial stance]</i></b><br/>I'm not sure this needs to be true. People sacrifice themselves in everyday life and they aren't necessarily "authoring their lives". I think the character can "decide for himself" that something is worth dying for. There's <b>obviously</b> some player input going on here in both stances, but it's also a feedback loop.<br/><br/><b><i>*Ok, in old school the player interfaces with the game world via his character. He has no meta level involvement. He cannot introduce his character to a scene because it would make dramatic sense or be cool.</i></b><br/>I agree. This is the part where "story is an actual concern" as opposed to the old school, where it is an afterthought. In "pure" old-school, if the character happens to be at the right place at the right time, that's awesome. In story now we <i>sometimes</i> just do it, because "it's cool" (but more explicitly, because it either complicates or resolves a situation, creating "drama").<br/><br/><b><i>*He does not act against his character's desires because his interest is in seeing the character go through hell and back again.</i></b><br/>Here, I don't think it's necessary to "act against a character's desires" in Story Now at all. In happens in <i>some</i> games, but it's not definitive. The games that I play these days are very explicit about playing passionate, driven characters with beliefs and goals. You mostly create story by following those drives. Going against these desires is sometimes good for the story, obviously, because real people aren't one dimensional.<br/><br/><b><i>*However, in old school it's not the whole truth because you act as if they did and what is important is what is important to the character, not what is important to the player.</i></b><br/>It is a very thin line. Two sides of the same coin really. It produces different realities, but it's the same thing. See above about character desires in "story now". It is very much about following character desires, too. But!<br/><br/>1. The desires are usually <i>authored</i> in such a way that they will put the character in untenable situations, yes. <br/><br/>2.  In Story Now, it is usually the GM's job to put players in untenable situations that challenge their desires. Whether the character-player decides to follow his desires and face the consequences or betray his desires constitutes "story". The GM is still impartial, it is absolutely wrong for him to presume one choice is better than another. Whether the player decides or the character decides is - I think - another issue.<br/><br/><b><i>*Equally, the idea that story is merely that which happened, devoid of thematic content, is fundamentally at odds with story gaming.</i></b><br/>Yep. This is what I mean when I say old-school is "story after". Things just happen and then we look back and see story. Just like real life, you go on a camping trip and when you come back you can tell stories about it. Or a story about your day at work or whatever. It wasn't intended to be a story when it was happening, but our brains interpret it that way in retrospect. That's old-school. Story now wants the players aware that we are here with the intention to tell a story, all of us.<br/><br/>Pretty good so far.

For some reason I want to think of story now as old-school with bard-physics.<br/><br/>They seems pretty compatible playstyles.  That is, as long as the GM is playing with a story now mindset, then the players could be any mix of story now and old-school leaning (even all old-school) and everyone would be happy and enjoy the game.  I'm assuming a little in that any meta desires and then given fictional (not meaning fake) causes, are there any other hangups?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13216/old-school-renaissance-what-should-happen-next" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13216/old-school-renaissance-what-should-happen-next" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13216/old-school-renaissance-what-should-happen-next/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13216%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13216%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
