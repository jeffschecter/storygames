I found it simple and useful, and even made a few refinements to it.<br/><br/>Eric's The Mountain Witch game starter goes like this:<br/><br/>You are all on the mountainside. You are being attacked by 100 Zombies. The credits are rolling. These are your intro scenes. What are you doing as the camera cuts to you? What does the audience see about your character?"<br/><br/>Then the GM points at each player.  The player says their name ("You see SACHIKO swinging a mace..."), what they are wearing and general appearance, other details about the character in kind of a fourth-wall way ("The audience can tell at a glance that KAMISHAKUJI is a haunted soul, the way he swings his katana madly").<br/><br/>Then, the player makes a single roll (in TMW, it's probably going to be a fighty-roll, but it can be whatever). The player narrates what happens due to that roll, and usually gets to show off a little, doing something awesome. <br/><br/>Then it's the next player's turn.  By the first circle around back to the GM, the players know the other characters' names, what they do, the cool things about them, and usually at least bits of what the player likes about their own character (so that you can later pull those parts into play in scenes with that character).<br/><br/>I've used the above for two Tenra Bansho games to great success, but I went even further and removed the die rolling. In a game where the PCs are supposed to be competent, I figure that this first action piece the player can basically make their character shine at doing whatever they want them to do as much as possible. That way, even if the dice are cold for the rest of the night, we have a sense that this character is competent at <i>something</i>.<br/><br/>In one of the games, I had four fighter-types working together and beating these two giant Tengu in combat, with the requisite anime style backflips and one-liners. At the last character's turn, the second tengu was struck down (the first was struck down earlier). This scene was noted as basically a "splash page" from a scene that happens LATER in the game, and we went from there into the start of the game proper, with only some of the characters knowing others, etc.  Later in the game, the tengu scene never actually happened, or it was assumed to have happened in between other scenes. Even if I described it again, it would have been a gloss-over, simply describing again what happened earlier, no die rolls.<br/><br/>It works out great. Everyone gets to show off their character, describe what they like about their character, show off to the audience a little bit, and by the first "scene proper" you've got some enthusiasm and momentum.<br/><br/>The above works best for games where the PCs are together (or at least near each other) at the start, and games where action is a common thing that happens. Also, it's of course best for heroic games, where the characters aren't constant failures or the like.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have some good campaign-starter techniques? <br/>How about for games where there's far more talking than fighting?<br/>How about for games where the PCs are not heroes, or in hardcore story-game fashion, there are PC protagonists, antagonists, anchors, etc?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam" title="Sam"><img alt="Sam" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam">Sam</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79974/#Comment_79974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T12:38:24+00:00" title="July  7, 2007 12:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not exactly a bang, but it started a game off well. A PbEM Heroquest game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI narrated the scene of some exiles from their clan arriving at a new stead and their leader, a priestess called Wilma, setting up the fire and getting everyone to recount what they did in each of the seasons in the previous year. The previous year was a series of disasters which befell the clan and ended up splitting it up. Attack by giant flying jellyfish (ahem!), appearance of mysterious Warriors of the Sun who burnt up the harvest, outbreak of the Ruby Flux, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player had to narrate what their character did. These acts were generally heroic but each had to fail at one of their deeds, fall short or whatever. Each season's narration yielded an ability, the failure one yielded a flaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs in your post, no rolls; all about introducing the heroes, including something less heroic. I think it got us going great. I think it may have involved some explicit fighting but a part of the idea was that those threats could not be defeated, only coped with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is online here http://www.eiderweb.net/firetribe/index.html, specifically the 'Prologue' links to the left.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79975/#Comment_79975" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T12:44:48+00:00" title="July  7, 2007 12:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite game sequence opening was a police dispatcher in a superhero game:<br/><br/>"Clear for emergency traffic, code 113, escape, all units clear non-essential calls and respond on frequency B.

I described them being in a brightly lit hall and seeing someone in the mirror.  We had three or four rounds of describing who they saw in the mirror (describing themselves) and then I turned it into a "Yes, but..." scenario where they started off in this endless mirrored hallway.<br/><br/>After playing that for half of the evening until they bonded together and worked to escape the mirrored hall -- all without dice or anything like that -- I then brought out my Unknown Armies book, handed them the notes I took of their character descriptions, and had them make characters.  Until that moment, they had no idea what game we were playing.

Got across the grand, exotic, sweeping romance and grand adventure take on the 30's I wanted to get across. Plust the scientist players description of his show still impressed me a month later.<br/><br/>The second adventure had the players crash their China Clipper onto the hanger deck of an 'airship' from the Hollow Earth - bit more involved that one.<br/><br/>I like openings though, always have to try and make them grand and exciting in some way - which doesn't have to be action orientated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80568/#Comment_80568" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T07:28:20+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  7:28AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I open my Spycraft games with everyone getting a Vignette scene very similar to the way Eric does TMW - I ask them to frame, I set up a one-roll conflict, they roll, they narrate success or failure, then their phone starts beeping to report for the real mission.

I'm all for the big action scene opener, but haven't really done that for a while. Well, actually, one campaign opened with someone getting thrown through the window of a bar, and then zooming into the fight inside, but each player had a chance to describe just how he was trashing his opponent before they all ran out the back door to head to more friendly digs.<br/><br/>In TMW games I've run, I open with everyone walking down the road leading to the forest they have to cross through to get to the mountain, then ask the players in turn to describe their characters and a scene which shows them doing something in their past that relates to why they're there. I really like that explosive "100 zombies are attacking you!" opening though!<br/><br/>I don't get a lot of chances to set it off in media res, but I do when I can. Otherwise it's usually a short intro moment that leads to something blowing up that the characters respond to. Now, I think I want to try to put it on one or more of the players to come up with something to kick things off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81358/#Comment_81358" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T18:34:53+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  6:34PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best campaign I've run to date, I gave the players a one-page fiction bit about the horrific collapse of their fairy-table kingdom and the headlong flight of refugees into the one place too scary for the invading hordes to follow, the cursed, abandoned city of the old High Kings. Then we made characters and did a short opening session of running like hell from the onrushing hordes across <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19812.msg207499" rel="nofollow">the Long Bridge</a> into the city. The session ended on them finally entering the dark, half-ruined gates.<br/><br/>Running setting dump, character creation, and one extended scene gave everyone a little workout with the system and their characters, and gave me plenty of inspiration about what kinds of things to throw at them next -- which was good, because I deliberately hadn't done <i>anything</i> on what was inside the city yet!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
