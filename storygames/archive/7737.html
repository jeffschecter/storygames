As far as the game itself? Well, I ran it, as Ryan Macklin likes to say, as Totemic Star Wars, with the book on the table, but without me cracking it open, almost ever. I basically just used the basic difficulty ratings and maybe a stormtrooper stat or two. Occasionally we used the rules regarding explosives. But that's more or less because of how I ran it. <br><br>There are two reasons that I enjoyed it quite a bit. The first is that it's freaking STAR WARS! It's not the prequels, it's the real thing. The original setting, once you get past all the shenanigans of the last decade and a half, is amazingly fun and evocative. The second reason I liked it was that it was a simple system that allowed our teenaged selves to roll shitloads of dice. I will say that it was almost a perfect system for my group of friends after playing a very weird AD&amp;D campaign, and me trying to slog through the original Changeling book. (A random buy that I still treasure.) <br><br>It's also so much more representative of the Star Wars pulp feel than the D20 versions.<br><br/>Personal advice if you plan on running a game of D6 Star Wars...<br/>Unless you only have one player, DO NOT bother running starship combat. It's boring for the rest of the group, even if they get to "man the cannons".<br/><br/>Would I play it now? No, unless someone else was running it, and they knew how to keep it engaging, but I guess that goes for most games.<br/><br/>Would I play a FATE version of old-school Star Wars (ep IV-VI)? HELL YES. That would be so perfect. If anyone writes a streamlined old-school Star Wars FATE game, I will do your laundry for life.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171760/#Comment_171760" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T12:11:50+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 12:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry John, I just realized that I didn't much answer your question.

It's the first game I read (maybe it's the first, period) to explain the idea that a game didn't have to be a simulation of anything. The system wasn't the "physics" of the imaginary world, as we loved to say back then. Instead, the game was one of <i>emulation</i>: of cinema techniques, genre tropes, melodrama and Star Wars -specific color.<br/><br/>It wasn't perfect, of course. There were still some fiddly little bits that were there just to simulate stuff (explosives rules, indeed). But the spirit of the game text was strong, and it taught us how to play a game that really felt like a movie and how to ignore the bits that didn't support that. We started doing <i>in media res</i> openings, cross-cutting to the villains plotting their evil plots, establishing shots (scene framing!), and flashbacks. Playing Star Wars for years taught us all kinds of good habits for moving away from wargaming as RPG.<br/><br/>Finally, the system was fast, easy to use, and incredibly empowering for PCs -- which really supported the free-wheeling "try anything" feel of the Star Wars movies. You didn't feel constrained by playing a class-role. Everyone flew spaceships, shot blasters, reprogrammed droids, and fast-talked Imperial agents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172354/#Comment_172354" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T10:48:27+00:00" title="October  1, 2008 10:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, and you could grab a character template, move a few die codes about and be off and running with your character super quick.<br/><br/>The guy who ran it the most for me wasn't into reading hugely detailed systems and all that but he loved Star Wars.

Note that all the good stuff mentioned here is from 1st edition. That iteration was a complete-in-one book game, built around simple rules and a lot of straightforward advice for encouraging the right mood and little clever mechanics for handling likely situations (for instance, characters who own a ship can spend XP to improve the ship's stats rather than their own). Conversely, 2nd edition onward was a more traditional rpg, much more simulation minded, lots more rules, and less emphasis on mood. Also, lots of supplements concerned with world-building for its own sake (the <i>Imperial Sourcebook</i>, frex, is amazingly dry and academic, including dozens of pages of legion command structure schematics). 2nd edition is very much about exploring and building the verisimilitude of the universe, the kind of game someone would run a Traveller-style merchant campaign in even though there's no precedent for such in the source material. 1st edition is all about doing just one thing well: breezy swashbuckling action adventure where the setting only matters as far as it facilitates that goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172421/#Comment_172421" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T13:45:54+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  1:45PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved almost everything about 1st ed.

I made a generic version of the ruleset I used for years and had many good times playing. <br/><br/>It was also great because it really encouraged wild, cinematic action. The wild die meant heroic successes and heroic failures were common (and tremendously entertaining). Combat was really flexible and fun because of the simple "drop one die to take an extra action" rule, and our fight scenes were really, really cool. I'd never seen that much fun _and_ fleixibility before (having mainly played AD&amp;D), from a relatively simple ruleset.<br/><br/>It was also the first game that really got us into a fun gaming zone--and probably just because of the title. The spirit of Star Wars meant we were all ready for fun, daring characters and lots of adventure. In contrast, when we played D&amp;D, we were all trying to recreate Tolkien, and, well, you know how that goes. I remember the Force/Jedi rules being a pain in the ass, though, and not representative of the movies. I think we almost never used them.<br/><br/>I think there are much better games that do the same thing or more out there now, though. In particular, adding up all those dice could take a while, especially if you get the math wrong...<br/><br/>I think the best thing about the game was the Archetypes--kind of like premade characters you could individualize and be ready to play in about two minutes.<br/><br/>I also have a group of friends that have been playing a Star Wars D6 campaign for about 10 years, and love it. However, as weird as it sounds, their game is very gritty, low-key, and "realistic". Somehow, it works for them--they've tried all sorts of other systems and they still love Star Wars D6.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172454/#Comment_172454" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:49:09+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:49PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2008 3:50PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I remember the Force/Jedi rules being a pain in the ass, though, and not representative of the movies.

But the best part was that being Star Wars, it both came with a ready-made pitch and an established set-up (with all its tropes and setting details) that were almost guaranteed to be shared in common by all the players. No negotiating what character types fit or debating how space travel works; just sit down with folks who've seen the movie and you're ready to go.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the growth of both the movie series and the Expanded Universe have diluted the newbie value of the game a lot. Ironic, since the supplement line for SWD6 largely kicked off the EU to begin with. The main problem is that the sort of wuxia-jedi action that dominates the current media isn't supported by the old game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172611/#Comment_172611" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T09:40:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  9:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What John said, plus what E. says.  SWd6 is the first licensed game I can think of which was done right: it was accessible enough to make it appealing to non-gamers who were Star Wars fans. Imagine the disappointment of, say, a Farscape fan finding out that in order to actually use the Farscape RPG you needed to own and have read the D&amp;D PHB at the very minimum.  Wonder how many non-gamers bought that, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
