Reading about techniques in a manner grounded in the game system is quite interesting, though, when there is a point to it. Paul Tevis' reports on actual play embedded in some of his podcast reviews were fantastic.<br/><br/>I tend to stay away from APs in podcast form. They're too long, generally pointless, and the often poor sound quality tends to make you lose the points that were there, as you tune out. It's too bad, because the format has great potential.<br/><br/>I don't tend to <i>write</i> APs in any but the most rare of circumstances, because writing a good AP report is fucking hard. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287674/#Comment_287674" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T16:40:56+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  4:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>My experience with AP is that I quickly lose interest unless there's a point to the AP.

There's also a lot of self-selection in terms of what gets written up, since few people want to record mundane sessions, and people are encouraged to use AP reports as vehicles for game theorizing. Also, in listening to audio recordings of my own playtest sessions I have picked up on issues that I completely missed while caught up in the moment of playing, and I have to assume the same thing is happening to every AP writer. With all of the subjectivity cooked into post-facto text-based AP reports, it can often be difficult to extract useful info from them. Add to that the issue of having to dump a lot of information quickly, a nearly impossible task even for great writers, and you quickly run into problems with readability in most AP reports.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoy the AP podcast format since you get a lot more context and you don't have the subjectivity of the author to deal with, but I have time to listen, and focus mostly on the shows that play the games I'm interested in learning about (e.g. <a href="http://www.thewalkingeye.com/" rel="nofollow">The Walking Eye</a>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287718/#Comment_287718" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T20:19:30+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  8:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I tend not to read AP for AP's sake.

Not so much in how story gamers mean, but nobody would write an article about what happened to them in a single-player mission of an FPS (because that happens to everyone who plays), but there was actually occasionally interesting stuff happening in Jedi Knight Online and Eve and so on.  <br/><br/>AP is exciting to me for the same reason - nobody would write the AP from what happened when they played a D&amp;D module or Adventure Path.  (Well, maybe they would, but it would be double-plus lame.)  The fact that we feel the urge to write down our AP after playing a story game shows just how engaged we are - in that postcoital glow we feel like we've created something worth remembering.<br/><br/>But yeah, trying to read it usually makes my eyes glaze over.  So I paradoxically feel that it's important that we write it (or at least want to write it), but it's not worth reading.<br/><br/>Same with New Game Journalism, actually.  There were maybe 2 or 3 articles that were really worth reading.

When I'm getting to know of a game. I have read a thing or two about it, and it sounds neat. I have most likely read a review or two, but those rarely give you a good idea of how the game actually works. What's the premise? What sort of stories can we tell with it? How much work does it involve? How do the mechanics work in Actual Play?<br/><br/>2. When I'm trying to learn a game. Usually I already have the game, I want to play it and I want to learn the tricks, avoid the pitfalls and listen to the common advice. I want to learn from other people's experiences, so I don't have to start from scratch.<br/><br/>3. When it is an AP report from a game I really really really like and I know it consistently offers interesting stories and fun play. Very few games excite me enough for me to get to this stage.<br/><br/>Other AP's I'd rather ignore. From once in a while I just randomly read some with interesting names (once can be surprised!), but that's rather uncommon for me.<br/><br/>Personally, I like reading the fiction stuff (if it is well written and not too extensive), reading about mechanics (how dice work, how are they tied to the fiction, which mechanics are fun and in what way) and listening to the advice and problems one is more likely to run into. I'd rather read something not too extensive, but juicy and to the point. Stylish writing is cool, but far from being a top priority for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287871/#Comment_287871" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T11:44:32+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 11:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad I asked.

Which, frankly makes it a perfectly legitimate sort of RPG related fun. <br/><br/>But what rubs me the wrong way is that culturally we've somehow decided that actual play reports are ideal for developing critical or analytical theory, for marketing RPGs new and old, and for informing ourselves about the way a game or a group plays. <br/><br/>Except when we develop and test theories, market products, and write informative reviews of some X outside of the domain of RPGs, we do not just have me write a little essay about a time my friends and I got together to do X. It is, at best, a limited tool in a vast toolbox.<br/><br/>I've been arguing that actual play reports get in the way of understanding and communicating what really happens in play for years, which ironically has gotten me called a "theory wanker" who doesn't want theory grounded in "actual play". So, no I have no problem with actual play reports, and I'm always very happy when people can play rather than talk, write and read about play, what I have a serious problem with is the fetishism which has surrounded the actual play report.   <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><br/>* I like to make a clear distinction between "actual play reports" - which baring a good discussion - are essentially a form of personal entertainment related to RPGs, and "actual play" where folks are, well, actually playing a game.

But man, there are way too many AP postings out there. I can't read 'em all and sift through it. I'm super-excited about Apocalypse World right now, and I'm MCing a game, but I barely read any of the AP on it on the official forum. If it's someone I know or someone's opinion I trust (like Judd Karlman's, say), then I'll usually read it and see if it's worthwhile.<br/><br/>It would be immensely helpful if AP threads were posted not with a title that's reminiscent of the fiction that happened in the game, but with a title that points to the in-game or in-person issues that the session is about. I.E., <b>not</b> "AW AP - Amidst the Ruins of Hong Kong" <b>but rather</b> "AW AP - The Implications of Sex Moves". I've never done this in my AP, but writing this has made me realize that I'm going to in the future.<br/><br/>I rarely post AP, but I do so pretty thoroughly with a game that I'm thinking through and especially one that I'm encountering problems with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288211/#Comment_288211" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T00:58:37+00:00" title="August 23, 2010 12:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, BIG difference between "actual play" and "actual play report" and "actual play discussion" and "actual play report discussion" and...<br/><br/>My favorite form: Playing something one day, then, if I get an idea or a thought from it, I post about it on a forum the next day.
