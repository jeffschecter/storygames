The GM described the group entering a train yard, and didn't describe the yard (which wasn't necessary at the time). So I imagined a mix of Black Mesa and City 17 from <i>Half Life </i>and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Cj&amp;q=de_train&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">de_train</a> from <i>Counterstrike</i>. Dusty, narrow, light from above somewhere.<br/><br/>A little while later, he sketched a map and described some more. Wide, damp, more rust. Almost completely different to what I'd imagined, apart from the trains. So I revisualised the place. Nothing I'd previous imagined needed to be discussed. I clarified a couple of wee details. I'd not done anything I 'couldnt' have. And the other players' actions and descriptions still fit.<br/><br/>A few weeks back, I played Dirty Secrets. One player was fond of, and good at narrating detail. The detail seemed almost tyrannical - before we knew a character, the player had defined them <i>too much</i>. It was also, for me, an uncomfortable amount of specificity - my brain turned off because it didn't have to visualise.<br/><br/>So what's going on in these two cases? And what examples do you have of the former, in particular?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106835/#Comment_106835" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T15:21:48+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  3:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something fiction writers have to work hard on -- providing enough details to create a striking image, but not so many that it overburdens the reader. If you read much 18th century English literature, you know that this wasn't a concern for writers and readers of the time; they were very happy with a chapter describing the protagonists looks, wardrobe and ancestry, and another chapter describing the ancestral mansion.  <br/><br/>I wonder if some of this is related to the rise of movies as a cultural medium, and the shift from a aural/verbal perspective to a visual one.  If you read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Maltese Falcon</span>, it contains a concise description of Sam Spade in it; nonetheless, I've never been able to see him as anyone other than Humphrey Bogart.  <br/><br/>It would be an interesting experiment to have different groups to stop, mid-encounter, and have everybody draw sketches of where the character are and what it looks like there.  My guess is that there's a huge amount of variation that doesn't become obvious until it becomes significant mechanically or narratively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106843/#Comment_106843" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T15:59:04+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  3:59PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For non-mechanical details, I fall back on Sorenson's Rule of Three: describe three things about the character/location/thingy.

It's rusty and dark," is plenty, most of the time. If I need a boxcar with a ladder on the side, it's in there, no worries. The short version gives us a place to expand on as needed, without being pinned down. I think almost everything in my gaming these days is coming in as this light weight. "Serpent cult. Poison magic. [drawing of sigil]." Then the real stuff happens in play.<br/><br/>Now, when we finally get a hold of the dark book of prophecy that we've been hunting for six sessions? Yeah, I can stand for someone to go on a bit about the look of the binding and what the paper is like and especially the kind of alien writing all scrawled in the margins. Maybe they even have some cool images cobbled together or a prop, even. Those can be great.<br/><br/>Another nice middle ground for me is <i>just</i> having images. I did this with our game set in 1500s Venice. I had a really great period map and a bunch of pictures of the city that could have been taken then if they had cameras. Plus a bunch of family names. And that was about it. The real content came about in play. Some was in my head before we started, or in my notebook. But a lot of it grew out of the word and image seeds and it was great stuff. Doubly great because we made it together and gave it texture and context.<br/><br/>And now that I think about it, I <i>did</i> try to do some kind of info dump at the beginning, but no one was invested and it was largely forgotten. A lot of it turned out to be a big part of the game, but that's because it grew as we went, not because we stuck to some pre-made, fixed thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106859/#Comment_106859" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T17:19:51+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  5:19PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danny's last paragraph touched on something interesting.

A painting is a painting. An adjustment in a movie tends to be about the story, not the imagery. We might have to tweak the picture a bit in certain novels, I suppose.<br/><br/>In RPGs, it's something do all the time, because our brains aren't linked up. And it's something we can be good at - keeping the picture low-res until a battle, when it becomes more detailed, say. It can also cause problems, when my image and your image aren't even close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106966/#Comment_106966" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T07:52:25+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  7:52AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The examples given make it pretty clear what's happening, and that's why I'm intrigued.
