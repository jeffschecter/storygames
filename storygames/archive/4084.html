Will you systematically use specific techniques in the ongoing play, Paul? Or the workshopping?</blockquote>\nI've been asked about this before, so I'm going to use this thread to answer specific questions about my experiences with the form.<br/><br/>The Setup: I do improv with Ventura Area TheatreSports. Earlier this year, we did a workshop with Joseph Limbaugh on Improvised Soap Opera. This is form he picked up at Dad's Garage Theatre in Atlanta and now directs at the Acme Comedy Theatre in LA. I like to call it "PTA without cards," though that's not quite accurate. It works like this: For some number of weeks (in our case, eight; for the Acme it's sixteen), you improvise a a forty-five minute episode of a soap opera each week. You have the same actors playing the same characters each episode (though often with cast members shuffling in and out as their schedules permit). Before the start of the run, you decide on the setting and some basic details of the cast (mostly names and relationships). Then, during each episode, at the end of each scene, the Director will frame the next one during the blackout. Something like "Tulsa confronts Silas about his drinking problem," or "Rooster discovers something unspeakable in the basement." When the lights come up, you play the scene. Repeat ad nauseum and end on a cliffhanger. During the final episode, resolve stuff.<br/><br/>Questions so far? Emily, I'll get to your specific questions once we've all gotten to the same page.<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91099/#Comment_91099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:09:09+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>Excellent.

As a primarily short-form oriented troupe, we tend to get in and get the job done as quickly as we can. The problem is, that's counter to the spirit of the genre we're trying to emulate. Soap operas move incredibly slowly. So, we have to fight our tendency to want to resolve things and in general slow things down.<br/><br/>We also try not to introduce more details than we need to. Unless we need to know right now that my character's father fought in WWI, it shouldn't get mentioned. Too many details leads to an over-constrained mass that we can't all keep track of.<br/><br/>The most important technique that we're working on (and this is related to the "don't resolve" stuff issue about) is listening for REALLY BIG OFFERS. Making them is important too, but it's vital that we don't move too quickly and miss things like this. If say to do someone, "I'd do anything to stop drinking," we both have to give that space. The audience should mentally be able to fill in the Dramatic Chord (as we're trying to do in our heads). And then we need to apply Dogs-style escalation to that promise. ("Anything? Well, then. . .")<br/><br/>As far as workshopping the characters goes, we started by creating a relationship map and then playing short scenes to further define the nature of those relationships. For me, that work as all been with the goal of figuring out what my character wants from the other characters. That way, when I end up on stage with them during performances, I know what to make scenes about and how to push the action along.<br/><br/>Does that answer your questions?<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91340/#Comment_91340" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T10:48:14+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 10:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I completely forgot something that ties in with the discussion about status we're having over on Graham's blog.<br/><br/>In a Soap Opera, the villains always win (until the last episode). If you want to play a sympathetic character, you have to lose all the time. The audience will always be on the side of the low-status characters, but in order to keep them on your side, you have to keep losing. This, as it turns out, is hard. My tendency in short-form is to play characters who start out low status but win in end, bring the high-status character low. In the Soap Opera, I'm playing a very low status character who has some rather undesirable character traits. However, as long as I keep losing, the audience will be on my side.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91365/#Comment_91365" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:03:53+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, <br/><br/>Yes, you're totally answering my questions.

I'm working with that in Sign in Stranger too: how do we keep the story in steady progress but not resolved in a short amount of time. There has to be a constant weaving in of new unresolved material but in a way that doesn't overwhelm what's being dealt with in the short term.  <br/><br/><i>We also try not to introduce more details than we need to.

This is primarily a genre-emulation thing. But I do agree with your observation: it's hard to strike a balance between build-up and burn down in games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Exactly.  Hooks are good, but too many loses all of  your momentum.  How are you dealing with this in the improv? Did your directors cut you back during the workshoping of the characters?</blockquote>\nThis is more of a complexity management issue than a momentum one. Unless I'm going to use a fact right then and there, I shouldn't introduce it, because that's just one more thing for the other actors to keep track of. As far as the workshopping side went, we were free to develop these sorts of details, but as always with the standard improv disclaimer: If it doesn't come out on stage and someone else contradicts it, it doesn't exist any more. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>So all that was defined was the relationships at first, as well as the overall situation/setting.

The first was a relationship circle, where everyone says how their character feels about the other characters (and why). These were always subject to negotiation, as we would often realize that a previously stated relationship would be more dramatically interesting if it were changed. ("Wait a minute. You're my best friend? Oh, then I should be having an affair with <i>your</i> wife instead of your brother's.") We took and exchanged notes on this. Second, we did character questionnaires. This one, in fact:\n<blockquote>CHARACTER QUESTIONS<br/><br/>   1. NAME AND NICKNAME? AGE?<br/>   2. DESCRIBE YOUR HOME AND HOMETOWN.<br/>   3. RELIGION? POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY?<br/>   4. WHAT WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE?<br/>   5. HAS YOUR LIFE WORKED OUT AS EXPECTED?<br/>   6. JOB/CAREER/OCCUPATION?<br/>   7. CLOSEST FRIEND?<br/>   8. WHO WOULD YOU KILL IF YOU COULD?<br/>   9. HOBBIES?<br/>  10. HERO OR PERSON YOU EMULATE?<br/>  11. WILDEST FANTASY?<br/>  12. GREATEST REGRET?<br/>  13. HOPES/DESIRES?<br/>  14. FEARS/PHOBIAS?<br/>  15. DEEPEST SECRET?<br/>  16. MORE THINKING OR FEELING?<br/>  17. FAVORITE/HATED FOODS AND DRINKS?<br/>  18. FAVORITE/HATED ACTIVITIES?<br/>  19.  WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU LIKE?<br/>  20.  HOW DOES YOUR CHARACTER MOVE? SHARP OR FLOWING, ETC.?<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>So at the end of the scene, you've changed the characters somehow: one has done something for the other, one is now in over their head, etc.  It sounds like you should then have the set up for the next set of situation complications that will hit up your character as the plot develops.

And, well, it's quite simply far less terrifying than being required to produce output at a "realistic" pace. I'm personally pretty comfortable LARPing, for instance, but would probably get fop sweat (I have at times) if I had to produce in front of an audience. Much less to be expected to do it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nImprov, it seems to me, demands that you act at least passably. RPGs, in my experience, are rarely ever about acting well. It's not about if you portray the character in a believable fashion where we may actually associate you with the character, it's more about chosing the decisions that the character makes. Which is why, in many cases, it's fine to do this in third person narrative. The Tabletop RPG player is more akin, in most cases, to being an author of a book writing out the actions of the character, than being an actor. That is, it's more important that we relay what the character said than to ensure that the delivery was somehow done by the player in such a way as the other players find the player to seem to be like the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is cool, because it then allows us to play such a wild array of things successfully in this context. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I'm biased when I think of my IRC game, because it is, in fact, written, and not acted at all. The players literally are, in fact, authors, and not actors. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this is important to understand: people equate first person acting with "role-playing." But that's usually juxtaposed with "combat" or "system play," if you will. But there's this third activity which is making and relaying decisions about what the character does, etc, that aren't precisely what you'd call "role-playing," nor are they noodling around with mechanics (though they may be informed by mechanics). This "narrating," for lack of a better term - it often involves things like negotiation or personal explanation, and other things than you'd consider narration - is just as important to play as the other two categories of activities. Except in cases where the group eschews it, such as these actually exist. <br/>\n<br/>\n(On a side note, there are lots of groups who claim that "role-playing" is their sumum bonum, meaning that they want all first-person portrayal. The claim is often that this is for immersion's sake or something. I think that often, however, what is occuring is a reaction to metagaming of the sort that they don't like. The point being that they may be throwing out good metagaming/narration techniques, just as a reaction to bad ones. Yah, Beeg Horseshoe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you intend to eschew this other activity, it's important to consider in your techniques and such that you might want to incorporate from improv or elsewhere, how they interact with this sort of play activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91644/#Comment_91644" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:58:32+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow--maybe we should start a new thread, Mike.

Our improv troupe does an excellent job of teaching what I call "story skills" and not such a good job of teaching acting skills. We're really good at getting people to understand how to establish relationships, pick up on offers, make strong choices, etc., but not so much on portraying characters. We actual had a short run of workshops a few months ago called "Acting for Improvisers" because we realized we weren't as good at it as we should be. And I'm actually taking a hiatus from our Monday evening workshops for the rest of the year so I can take an acting class at the local community college.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91681/#Comment_91681" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:53:28+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite> What is the audience going to be like, Paul?

Listening to what offers they accept is a big deal, and breaking promises you've made to the audience is a great way to kill a scene. I think I told you about this at GenCon, Emily, but I'll repeat it just in case. A few months ago, we were doing an Opera scene about dental hygiene. The Demon of Gingivitis was trying to get me to use someone else's toothbrush. I was horrified by this, but the audience chanting for me to do it. I didn't, and it gutted the scene. My father saved me, but it didn't really matter. I should have brushed my teeth and died.<br/><br/>Audiences also have a strange way of finding things funny that you don't expect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92241/#Comment_92241" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:47:55+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 11:50AM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>there's this third activity which is making and relaying decisions about what the character does, etc, that aren't precisely what you'd call "role-playing,"</blockquote>\nIt's not what I'd call "acting", but it's exactly what I think of as "roleplaying".   A big part of improv is just getting information across, and effectively making decisions about your character to further your story.  Both of these things are shared by the decision-relaying process that you describe.  And, it is this aspect that most improv techniques are designed to facilitate!
