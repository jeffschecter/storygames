Should you only promote your game once when you first publish it? Is it okay to post it everyonce in a great while? Does it make a difference if you are offering the game free of charge or selling it? Does it make a difference if the game is generating a lot of interest and posts? What is the proper etiquette?

So posting about your game once a month would be too often if the sole point of your post would be to win attention, while having what amounts to a weekly blog would be fine as long as each time your post attempted to initiate some meaningful dialogue with others.<br/><br/>The people who write about their games a lot here are generally doing game design, and thus asking or answering a steady stream of questions as they progress. Those with finished games would usually write about it whenever something interesting happens regarding the game. There's no particular reason why one couldn't write about a finished game more regularly, each time approaching the conversation from a different direction, of course.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, the interactivity of the posting is the most important quality in making it acceptable, with practical informativeness being second-most-important. If a post neither enables conversation, nor provides concretely useful information, I'm likely to disdain it as crude attention-hogging. For example, the annually repeating informative reminders about various conventions and such are acceptable in my eyes not because they make for sensible discussion, but because they're to the point and useful for those interested in the particular convention. Multiple posts about the same convention, with no new information, would amount to useless attention-hogging. A similar standard holds to games, I feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456801/#Comment_456801" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-02T21:44:01+00:00" title="October  2, 2016  9:44PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2016 10:10PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: I asked Eero what he thought of advertising one kickstarter                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456803/#Comment_456803" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-02T22:06:48+00:00" title="October  2, 2016 10:06PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't find a simple one-time announcement of a Kickstarter campaign to be amiss - new games <i>are</i> information of interest here, after all! Multiple threads about the same crowdfunding campaign would be boorish when one could just as well make multiple posts in a single thread.<br/><br/>Really, Kickstarter is not that different from an announcement of publication, which is another well-established press release event. I wouldn't find it unusual if a given game were promoted here once for its Kickstarter, once for being generally available, and once for being out of print, for example. New supplements, major media appearances ("My game will be on TV next week!"), new print runs and such are also reasonable excuses.<br/><br/>As a counter-point, a new thread to tell us that your crowdfunding campaign (that you posted about when it started) is drawing to a close would seem impolitely hoggy to me. Likewise if you were to start a new thread for your every convention appearance, or when you get reviewed by somebody, and so on - minor things like that are clearly just an excuse to keep posting about your game, which is simply sad in a world where a person with a whit of creativity could just as well post something substantial about the game itself. If a discussion of how to stat up the Enterprise in your rules system would be more interesting than the press release, consider whether you really need to post that "press release" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>All things considered, advertising spam hasn't been much of a problem here historically. Given the relatively low attendance nowadays, it should be even less so. You should probably just post about your game and rely on others to tell you if they feel that you're harping on it too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456805/#Comment_456805" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-02T22:14:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2016 10:14PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great, thanks for the thoughtful posts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456806/#Comment_456806" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-03T00:47:25+00:00" title="October  3, 2016 12:47AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2016 12:48AM by zircher.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to follow the two thread rule for starters, one for announcements/updates and another for extended discussion of the system and settings if warranted.

I got a less detailed answer but it really seems there is no immediately acceptable answer. If people are interested lots of posts seem fine. If no one cares they just don't comment. I thought Id get more just on the fact that I made a sci -fi thing. But alas this community has some diverging Prerogatives <i>(and that's ok, I just didn't know)</i>. <br/><br/>There are the "lets talk about doing specific stuff with traditional gaming (D&amp;D, pathfinder, ect.)" crowd. There's the "I'm all about the indie games" crowd. They are often looking for new and or very specific things that people have made. I thought I'd get more just passerby's in the indie crowd but they are three years ahead of me on hacks and new concepts, and are looking for lots of little, unique, specific games.  I have fallen in a rut in the sense that I was shooting for a "new general sci-fi system made by yours truly." Which doesn't fit nicely in either of the strong above trends. And as Mike Sands said in his reply to the post about my RPG I'm not likely to see much traction really and should not get my hopes up about a lot of insightful critique (though I did get some great stuff) It wasn't like people are falling over themselves to read your stuff, there's just been too much stuff<i> and I get that</i>. <br/><br/>As an aside I want to say for the record I don't claim to have represented all the trends that ever will be here, just the one's that have concerned my posts. But yeah its a tough game that no one prepares you for, the idea that you might make something you really believe in but nobody cares, and that's totally fine on their end but what do you do? The obvious answer would be make stuff that people WILL care about and make posts and they will come, but i mean that's actually hard to do, not to mention the fact that in this isolated small community, all you have to go on to motivate you to create is what YOU are interested in, not taking a poll and making whatever the highest item is. Mainly because there is no such poll, and something being a big item everyone seems to want doesn't make it easy to create or give you the insight, energy, and ability to create it.<br/><br/>The answer as far as I've seen is post as much as you like, see what happens and adjust. Seriously there is no right answer here. Either it will feel like a sad attempt to pull views from the crowd or the best thing ever, and it may have nothing to do with your product, its just they way things are and you see what happens. Learn from your own experience, everything else is just kind of general advice that may or may not apply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456808/#Comment_456808" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-03T01:34:04+00:00" title="October  3, 2016  1:34AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2016 1:36AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool k_man, I appreciate the thoughts.

Comment on other people's topics, offer to playtest their games, make friends.<br/><br/>A stranger comes here and posts about some game they made? I probably won't even click on it unless I'm killing time or something about the title jumps out at me.<br/><br/>But if you post something, I will definitely read it, because you're a regular contributor, you seem like a nice person, and we've had a few very affable and human conversations. <br/><br/>I think something like that goes for most people!<br/><br/>Another way is to offer interesting content. If you post something that is perceived as interesting or quality on a regular basis, people will start to think of you as a person to follow.<br/><br/>It's been pretty rare to see anyone "over promote" here at S-G. I think that if you do, someone will say so sooner or later (possibly a mod).
