                    There was a moment when I glanced around, and three of the four tables had a baby nursing at the table. That's gotta be a gaming con first!<br/><br/>Best Friends: <br/>This was fun, and we (Nathan, me, Steve, Dev - and Julia for a tiny bit) agreed we'd all like to play BF again with less of a 'smart, together' group concept. Playing new congresswomen colored us as too slick to get into the really petty goodness I think is at the heart of BF. Barristas and pirates were mentioned. Emily did a good job as GM, giving spin as needed and poking us in interesting directions.  We kind of handed her a lot to do, with being congresswomen *and* pulling off a shady deal. My favorite scenes: Dev's Repulican asking Nathan's Green-Rainbow to come with her - it was a clear case of 'you're still my friend even though we're politically opposite'; the president admitting the VP was out of controll; exposing the Platinum Club on the senate floor.<br/><br/>carry. a game about war:<br/>Rocked. I loved the first part where Nathan, Jeff, Eben, Shreyas and I all talked about how we were connected to the military - who we knew, which of our uncles fought where, etc. - before playing. It really gave a very personal edge to the game. One thing I love about carry is the pre-gen characters Nathan brings. They are rich and full, and he's obviously thought a lot about them. I also love that you can choose how much responsibility you want to start with. Jeff was our leader, Sgt. Ram.; Shreyas was LCpl. Saint; Eben was the new kid, Pvt. Jewel, and I was Pvt. Chameleon. The process of getting burdens via group effort was cool, too, especially when what the next person wrote was just what I'd  been thinking. My favorite scenes: Ram and the other sergent posturing in the fire-fight; Ram and the general; me confronting my ex-best friend with the knowledge that I haven't yet sold him out. I'd happily play carry again tomorrow.                </div>

                            Word. My thoughts on the Best Friends game are <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22109.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for the nonce. I'll probably be writing something more in depth up about the game real soon now.<br/><br/>I'm glad you enjoyed carry, Meg! I had a good time as well. I think it's interesting that some of the characters are more compelling than others - Chameleon has been played in every game I've run, Jewel has been in many of them, and the Sgt. is also a popular choice. Saint has been chosen multiple times by people who aren't as "into" the genre or the game (Shreyas said he was pretty tired coming in, f'rex). This is the first time nobody has played the medic Jesus - interesting! It was cool to me that setting explicit lines at the beginning of the game really does shape the session, and how there's enough depth to the situation that even once we cut off the more horrific options (rape, torture &amp; cruelty, children as victims) we still had a solid PG-13 session.<br/><br/>Was there anything that rubbed you the wrong way or wasn't particulary fun?                        </div>

                            Huh. I seriously don't remember anything striking me as 'off'. The pace was good, the conflicts were logical and cool, and I thought everyone got a decent shot at their character's issues. I'll give it some thought, and see if anything comes up.                        </div>

<p>Nathan, that's a really interesting observation about the patterns of character selection you've seen. Any thoughts on what brought them about?</p>

                            *shrug* Here's why I played who I did, FWIW.<br/>I decided I wanted to play across ethnicity, so that narrowed the field for me. I chose Chameleon based on his 'strong, silent type with a side of ass-kicking' - he's a character-type I often play. I almost chose Anaconda.                        </div>

                            Huh. <br/><br/>Well, there's a handful of characters who I don't think anyone has played (most of the "big bruiser" types). <br/><br/>Chameleon has been played every session I've run - TonyLB managed to almost make it through the entire game without him speaking! I think the "point man" is a popular concept. He's kind of a maverick, has some authority without being in charge, and the strong silent asskicker, as Meg points out, is a solid character archetype.<br/><br/>Jesus, the medic, is also the one who stands out as very popular. He's the squad medic, and he's called Jesus, so there's a potent symbolic connection. When I created him I thought that his call sign was a little much, but in play it hasn't been particularly weird. <br/><br/>Ram, the sergeant, I think is either interesting or not because of his rank. Some people look at their burden and go "huh, well, the Sergeant wouldn't be good" and something they go "I have to be the Sergeant!". Usually burdens that have to do with responsibility and authority go to him.<br/><br/>Oftentimes, at least one of the three Corporals is taken (Locker, Anaconda or Raven). I think they are good choice for people who want to play characters/have burdnes concerning leadership and responsibility, but the Sergeant is too much.<br/><br/>Looking back at some notes, I was wrong above. I was thinking of Alexander Newman, who played Locker, not Saint - but he had a burden about drug addiction, which is why I got confused. But he created that Burden because he was playing a little more out of intellectual interest and not genre interest, and I think it provided a good distancing factor for him.<br/><br/>The last trend I've seen is people taking the more inexperienced members of the squad (Skid, Bull, Jewel) to hook into appropriate burdens and to contrast with players who take the Sergeant and Corporals.                        </div>

                            I think there are some guys that just harder to step up to - Bull and Professor due to their apparent annoying behavior, and Temple and Coyote due to their nerves and inexperience. Next time I play, I want to be either Big White or Deadwood.                        </div>
