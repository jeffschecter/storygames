The lady's voice is melodic even, "Ready, ready, ready, ready...  Six, two, three, niner; eight, niner, four, seven; three, one, two..."  Numbers repeating on a loop.  <br/>"End transmission."<br/><br/>Lying in bed--awake.  Heart racing.  Pupils dilating.  Then dressing.  Grabbing.  Running.  Running fast.  Running where?  Running to what?  Then there's jumping.  And kicking.  And punching.  And shooting.  Yeah, lot's of shooting.  And god, lot's of running. <br/><br/>Looking for what?  Pulling the threads together.  Holding them together.  You...  Why?  Are you remembering, yet?  Never mind.  There's always fighting.  Crashing.  Shooting.  And of course, running.  And then darkened-dreaming.  And then the numbers again, repeating.

When the Conspiracy Meter reaches ten, start the next round with catastrophic  complications in play (full-scale invasion, martial law, crashing stock market; nuclear, or ecological disaster, etc.)<br/><br/>THREATS<br/>Threats should be set up in a line representing the pursuit or flight of the agent.  Choose one threat as the controlling threat to put at the end of the line.  The nature of the controlling threat should remain hidden until the end.  Unless the agents have some intelligence about it, don't roll it up until the agents are about to face it (for GM-less play).  At least half the threats are count-down threats directly controlled by the controlling threat (staged, or guarding it) or being manipulated by it. <br/><br/>Each threat has a location for color, complications, and rewards.  If an agent rolls 7+ hits while confronting a threat, he/she gets that threat's reward and gain a new bonus die for it.<br/><br/>Count-down threats don't advance the Conspiracy Meter; instead, when they reach zero, they add new complications (activated security systems, radiological fallout, alert guards, secret police, counter-intel, disinformation, pursuers, hostages, etc.)<br/><br/>THREAT-O-MATIC<br/>d6 Edge                    Trade                      Str/Weak            Location                    Reward<br/>1  Fanatic or Freelance    Syndicate or Gang          Action or Steel     Train station or Airport    Quid Pro Quo<br/>2  Corporate or Neo-nazi   Agents or Terrorists       Combat or Will      Bridge or Stadium           Asset<br/>3  Rogue or Revolutionary  Network or Defense System  Deception or Power  Military Base or Port       Intelligence<br/>4  Shadow or Underworld    Battalion or Saboteur      Tech or Luck        Hotel or City Street        Technology<br/>5  Para-military or ????

I found an interesting, unfinished, playset idea by <a href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">@Jarvis</a>, called <ins>Action Squad</ins>, in a 2009 Story Games post.  I talked to Jarvis about finishing it up; he gave me the green light.  When I looked at the original material, I thought that there were more that one playset idea in it, so I carved off a section.  This is <ins>Clandestine Patrol</ins> (maybe it needs a catchier name!)  So, I'm playtesting this on Friday.  I thought you might be interested to try it out too.  Comments are welcome.
