I mean, if my game's sales continue at this rate, I'm looking at breaking even by the time it's been out for a year. Which is great. After that, it's all profit. Cash money, wodie. Yes, I <b>will</b> have fries with that, thank you.<br/><br/>But if I'd done things differently, if I'd made a game that I wasn't 100% excited about, because I was hoping for that extra $100 in sales, or $1000, I would be very unhappy right now. It's all about making the game that you want to make, that you want to play -- and if you feel that you have to spend money to get it made, keep your costs low enough that you can at least break even (or come close).<br/><br/>If you're one of those people who creates games that they believe in, and you're selling thousands and thousands of copies, then you're a badass and I salute you. But I believe that it would be a mistake for me to try to design a game in the hope of matching your sales. That way lies madness.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Or rather, everyone who was already a game designer is now standing up to be counted as one.  And it's awesome!  I love the explosion of different ideas, the way everyone has their own project.  I love the hacks, the house rules, the home-brews, and everything.  I think that, I hope that, the distinction between "player" and "designer" is disappearing just as the distinction between "GM" and "player" is.  <br/><br/>I think you're right on the money, Joshua, in suggesting that not every design needs to follow the "publish on IPR, promote at Cons" model.  I think we're hung up on that in the same way we were hung up on the three-tier model.  Certainly that's an effective way to publish a game, but it's not always best for every game.  I'm constantly designing games, hacking games, and so on, like everyone else.  I play these games with my friends, and we have fun.  That's my goal.  A few of the things I've done I've published as free PDFs, and it makes me feel good when people say nice things about them.  But if I hadn't made them first and foremost as a way to play fun games with my friends, I'd be pretty unsatisfied.  <br/><br/>I wrote about this same topic last year on Knife Fight, and I've been thinking about it a lot since then.  I think there will always be a range of different publishing models, from three-tier distribution through self-publishing, and down to trades between friends.  I guess what I'd like to see is that last model be seen as equally valid, and not just a consolation pize for people who aren't cool enough to play with the big boys and girls.  I'm really happy that this is starting to happen.

The former means you write, playtest and put out into the world, either by yourself in a "here you go, guys" format or through an imprint kind of deal. The latter means you do all the previous, but are also interested in doing the business of Publishing/being a Publisher. You do not need B to do A. Publishing a game and selling it to others means you are entering into a business deal, and if you're not gonna do that right, then why take on that headache at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126284/#Comment_126284" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T14:30:27+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  2:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel</cite>do you want to be published or do you want to Publish?</blockquote>\nThis is similar to an issue for would-be writers in general:  Do you want to write, or do you want to <em>have written</em>?

It does not mean its the "primary" definition.  It is not the most important definition and most certainly does not mean the best definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs issuing for sale publishing? yes.  Is simply issuing also publishing? also yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua, I trust it is no longer necessary at this point to identify who's not making this distinction?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGareth, there is certainly a big difference in publishing for profit as a business, and publishing for reasons that have nothing to do with profit or business.  I have no doubt that your advice with regards to the former is solid and valuable.  But to the extent you want to claim that the latter is "not publishing" or somehow harmful to the efforts of the former, you can go fuck yourself...seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for being a laughingstock...please.  There are a number of top industry people who stream into the Forge booth every year and walk out with armfuls of indie games.  There are a number of top industry people who specifically ask to have indie games demoed for them and make special arrangements for after hours play.  There are a number of traditional games where the influence of indie designs can be seen.  There are a number of indie publishers who've been recognized and given awards by top industry people.  Laughingstock?  I think not.  I think the only "industry" people who are laughing at indie publishers are the fools who aren't nearly as important players in the industry as they like to pretend they are.  And I have that direct from folks who ARE important players for real, and not just in their own imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know of any artists who haven't been paid what they were promised on time from any indie publisher I'm familiar with.  I know several artists who are happy to do indie commissions because they know they'll actually be paid...because they've done plenty of work for "real" publishers who's "business plan" apparently included stiffing the freelancers.

I decided that I just didn't want to do what I was doing . In the year since releasing Panty Explosion I had been to a half dozen cons, dealt with tons of printers, distributors, stores and individuals (often in languages I didn't understand), stuffed a few hundred books into envelops, wrote, tested and published a companion game, sat on panels, argued with tons of people and was called all kinds of names. I helped grow Portland's indie game community with Travis, Matthew, Colin and a bunch of other great people, I ran or played in two or three games a week. I posted, argued and participated on forums, chat rooms and blogs constantly, and I promoted my game in any place and way that I could. <br><br>And looking back, it was a year well spent. But I was exhausted. I was physically and emotionally drained. I realized that despite the fun I was having, all that stuff was keeping me from doing what was important to me. It was keeping me from being actively creative.<br><br>So I decided to just stop. I didn't go to Gencon. I stayed away from some other regional shows as well. I stopped promoting my games, and I stopped posting to (and reading) this and most other gaming sites. I let Classroom Deathmatch go out of print, and I only ordered a minimal reprint for PE. I stopped running games, and I stopped playing games (for any other reason then personal enjoyment)I let myself relax, and I let myself focus on getting some good work done.<br><br/>It's been really nice. I've put some really solid work in on my web comic (and to a lesser extent, the art for Bliss Stage), and I've been enjoying playing and working on my new game design. I feel happy and good. I don't feel like I'm missing anything. I don't regret the year of hard work I spent promoting PE, but I don't think I'll do it again. <br/><br/>There have been side effects of course. Sales of our books have slowed. So be it. I'm happy.<br/><br/>Jake                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126370/#Comment_126370" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T00:06:35+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, Jake.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126377/#Comment_126377" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T01:08:14+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  1:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going back to the original subject, and trying to decide why I have chosen (for example) to publish Solipsist by printing it in hardcopy and distributing it to IPR, rather than punting out a PDF, I have come to the conclusion that it has a lot to do with closure, and with making sure that the game is *finished*.<br/><br/>I find it hard to finish things, and I know lots of designers are the same. Left to my own devices I will keep tinkering with a system forever, adding something there, taking something away here, and probably eventually rewriting the whole thing in some other system that isn't as good as what I started with. I've seen plenty of other people do the same, and never finish their games. For me publishing my game, in a final, paper, printed, distributed form, makes me actually finish it, polish it, and stop messing with it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now evidence of PDF sales and blog-released games shows that other people don't always suffer from the same syndrome.

Anyway, I've been biting my lip over this thread for a couple of days because its made me think long and hard about some things regarding the entire indie rpg design experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore reading onwards, can we all prepare our 'tongue-in-cheek' filters to low and our reading charitably screens to high? Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Mr Glass Half Full. I look at some of the things that people post on this and other forums as cautionary tales and well-thought out advice regarding the entire adventure of games design from people who have blazed a trail before me. A lot of it is common sense - like 'don't spend what you can't afford to lose' and 'if it stops being fun then don't do it.' Sometimes we need to hear that to remind ourselves to take off the blinkers and cast aside the tunnel vision that our design work can create.<br/>\n<br/>\n(remember those filters and screens? Now please)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm Mr Glass Half Empty and what I see is yet another apparent truism barrier to participation in the Indie Games Design Movement being created by people who have already established themselves within the movement. You think I'm kidding huh? Check out what I've been 'told' since I first joined?<br/>\n<br/>\n- You cannot - CANNOT - have a game ready for GenCon. If you do then it MUST be half-baked. Established folks like Luke Crane can do it, but you? You new guy? Oh no, thats not on. Any other time but GenCon is fine but release at that high-sales time and ... bad designer! greedy designer!<br/>\n<br/>\n- You have to playtest. No really, you can never playtest enough. Indeed your game HAS to be playtested so much that it can stay in an almost infinite playtest loop as when it is taken out of playtest and published and something doesn't sit right with a reader ... it hasn't been tested well enough!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Beyond playtesting you can ASHCAN, which is like playtesting but with money involved. And depending on who you talk to this is either a good idea or makes you a handmaiden to Satan.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You cannot do the game by yourself. You need a paid artist (well meaning friends doing it for the love are being exploited like South East Asian orphans), an editor, a layout guy. You need professional art software, professional layout software and even special text writing software for jotting down notes. The sheer technological buy-in to writing the damned thing is immense!<br/>\n<br/>\n- The only socially acceptable form of promotion is word of mouth. You cannot pimp your product that you have had the audacity to bring to the market without insulting someone with your base capitalism.<br/>\n<br/>\n- And now, increasingly it would appear, you should consider not even printing a hard copy of your game. People with print published games and income from those published games are say that maybe you shouldn't do the same. For your own good. To make you happy. And people are saying what a positive experience they had not print publishing. And soon it will become like GenCon, where only a select few seem to have a licence to release there without being castigated. Gah!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n(and back to the real world of Neil)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so that was a little bit of fun hyperbole, but in the end I think it serves a purpose. It seems very quickly that a few blog posts can become a theme which becomes a movement which becomes a truism or a received wisdom. And in so doing the joy of the indie games design thing starts to creep towards the rigidity and banality of the old design system where only the chosen few could be 'proper' games designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud the posts that prompted this because they reiterate questions that we should always be asking ourselves about our investment and hobby endeavours. However, I wouldn't be stunned if Mr Glass Half Empty is seething in front of his screen condemning a blatant attempt at market segment protection!!!!~\xa3$!<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126385/#Comment_126385" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T03:12:05+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  3:12AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot do the game by yourself.

I've heard people say that too.<br><br>Personally I do think that being published has a cachet, and not just from the Indie Industry. You get it from the writing side as well, being published is *special*, like having an agent.

Brought a smile to my face.<br><br>The rest of this post contains a lot of "for me" and "as far as I'm concerned" and "I think".<br><br>As Joshua A. C. Newman (it's weird, but I always have to refer to him by his full name -- it's like, if I leave out the middle initials, I'm not giving him proper credit or something) put it, "I think that people should make things in the way that makes them happiest." I should probably just quote him and be done with it. But I do have a few points to make. Apologies in advance for the length of this post.<br><br>I believe that independent game development should be just that -- independent. My game is going to be ready for GenCon -- eleven and a half months after its release. I didn't ashcan. I'm not even a hundred percent sure how to do that. I hired a bunch of artists. I promote my game in a variety of different ways -- word of mouth being just one of them. I also do banner ads and I hand out review copies. And I aim to make some money with this game. Last time around, I broke even and maybe pulled in a hundred bucks on top of that. This time around, I'd like to make enough cash to do something really cool with the profits. Maybe I'll spend the money on hiring a bunch of artists for a new game.<br><br>Mr. Glass Half-Empty will probably snort with derision. So what? It's my money, my game, my time. Cachet is invisible and intangible. I can't do anything with it. It's useless. Same goes for condemnation, status, and accolades. Those things won't put gas on my car. I can't listen to them on my iPod. They have no presence at my gaming table, where I throw dice with my buddies. There are elements which one can perceive in any hobby -- forum chatter, private messages, praise, snarkiness, categorization. I guess that some of this stuff can be useful, but much of it is pretty irrelevant. To me, at any rate. I made a game. I like it. That's all that really matters.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>It seems very quickly that a few blog posts can become a theme which becomes a movement which becomes a truism or a received wisdom.

The problem with themes, movements, truisms, and wisdom is that they're all ephemeral. You make a game, people will still be playing it years from now. Not a lot of people, but someone out there is going to play it once in a while. You will probably never hear about it. I still own and play the same games I played in the eighties. I know I'm not alone in this.<br><br>Point is, all of this concern about how we're perceived, or what people think, or (worse) how they feel -- it should never hinder one's desire to create something cool, or to deliver it to the world in a certain way. You got a few thousand dollars to burn, you want to print your game up with color interior art and a sassy little gold tassel bookmark? Go for it. If you've got the business acumen to pursue the three-tier model or whatever the hell, then good for you. Or, maybe you don't want to spend any money up front, so you type up your game with a free program like Open Office, and you illustrate it with some images from Morguefile, and you upload the file to Lulu, or you make it available for free as a PDF. Great. Whatever. If it's cool, I'll pick it up. If not, I'll pass, and someone else will think that it's cool, and he or she will buy it. The important thing is that you get what you want from the experience.<br><br>I used to design video games for Ubisoft. Now I work for Sony. I love my job, but there are parameters, because it's someone else's money and someone else's idea. What I do on my own time is unfettered -- I make it the way that I want it made -- and the game is what it is. Since the internet is a large place, I know that someone somewhere is bound to like what I've done.<br><br>I tend to focus on the specific activities that work for me. I enjoy learning about layout. I enjoy marketing and production and project management. I enjoy writing and designing. I enjoy cons -- I love to hang out and talk to people about gaming, I like running games, I like making new friends. I like talking about games on message boards (so long as it's neither hostile nor academic).

A <i>publication</i>, the product of publishing, is something I spend money on: that's common use.  Hell, I think the innate commerciality of the term is part of what's exerted a subtle psychological pressure on folks to go all the way to selling what they create.<br><br>But when I was five, I didn't know shit about any of that.  But I knew, thanks to Mom and Dad, that it was good -- hell, that it was <i>important</i> -- to <b>share</b> things.  And that's what's really at the root of that thing which has been conflated with the idea of publication, the thing that people wanted to do but let all of the commercial trappings of publishing get in the way of: the joy of making something and then giving it to other people and seeing the fun it gives them.<br/><br/>Which is just another expression of the businessman/philosopher-artist divide that I think is operant here.  "Businessman" is to publishing as "philosopher" or "artist" is to sharing.  For one, the point of the act is to successfully engage in commerce with the fruits of a creative effort; for the other, the fruits of the creative effort is where it starts and ends.  <br/><br/>There's a lot of happiness that can rot away inside that fruit once you add the commerce to it, if you're not careful and clear about why you're adding it.<br/><br/>So, remember what it's like to be five.  Remember that sharing is important and good.  Remember that five was a pretty happy thing to be.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126424/#Comment_126424" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T07:09:23+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  7:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 7:14AM by Judd.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WIthdrawn.<br/><br/>Semantic bullshit.<br/><br/>My apologies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126429/#Comment_126429" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T07:24:29+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  7:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil, Rafael,<br/><br/>I don't think anyone is trying to keep other indie designers down or tell them how to run things.  Honestly, I used to have the sense the designers who had "made it" were trying to keep me from doing the same thing, that they wouldn't accept me because I hadn't published something, and they kept describing more obstacles to the success of indie games, which felt like they kept raising the bar so as not to include me.  This is part of what the internet does to these conversations, I think, turning them into something resembling fucked-up status games when really it's just a bunch of fellow hobbyists trying to give advice to each other, based on our own subjective experiences.<br/><br/>Vincent once said something to me, like "I make a bad The Man, though I know you want one."  It could have just as easily been Luke or Ron who said it.  As much as the indie roleplaying scene can seem like a new establishment, the same old wine in a brand new bottle, something that must be rebelled against in order to break free of the restrictions that hold us back, in person, when you're not limited by the internet, it's really just a bunch of people who love this hobby and are happy to talk with anyone about it, whether it's play or game design or publishing or whatever.<br/><br/>So... if you want to take the accepted wisdom on how to publish or design or play and do completely different, then I say "Amen."  That willingness to challenge existing ways of doing things is what created this community in the first place.  Honestly, it's the only thing that keeps indie roleplaying vibrant and not a slowly calcifying group of roleplaying traditions branched off from the main body of roleplaying.  Whether you feel like a part of the scene or not, YOU ARE INDIE ROLEPLAYING, whether you publish in the Forge diaspora model or not.  And honestly, I'm always really excited when people do things differently, because my inner rebel goes "Damn straight!"<br/><br/>But that doesn't make the indie games scene The Man that must be rebelled against, not because it's some all encompassing blob that'll swallow you and your game up while chaning "One of us!  One of us!"  But because indie roleplaying is way broader than the Forge diaspora.  It includes folks like Malcolm and Gareth who hate the Forge diaspora.  It includes people publishing their homegrown d20 book that are much less likely to be frequent posters on Story Games or participate in IPR.  It may seem like we are all fighting each other to make money and, more importantly, to win status, fame, and accolades, but we really are all in this together, fighting as one for the betterment of the hobby.<br/><br/>While it may seem like some indie game designer on the internet is telling you how things must be done and trampling all over your dreams, generally, I think they're just trying to warn you about problems that they've encountered.  If you want to plow right into those problems or embrace them as good things, more power to you.  If you have to say "fuck all this jazz" and walk off to do your own thing, that's cool.  I had to do that with the Forge in order to find my own voice and figure out what I wanted out of game publishing.  Does that mean the Forge sucked?  No.  It just means it wasn't what I needed right then.  It may be that the stuff that gets thrown around here on SG (or on any other forum) isn't the stuff you need.  That's cool.  But I hope you find it somewhere and I hope you keep doing what you want to do, acknowledging other people's experiences and learning from them without taking anything they say as gospel.<br/><br/>So... uh, yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126432/#Comment_126432" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T07:29:58+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  7:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 7:38AM by Matt Snyder.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred, what businessman/philosopher-artist divide? What is the distinction here? I'm particuarly puzzled at this coming from a guy who built his customer base on ... publishing (sharing? whatever) a free game that involved no "publishing" as you now define it.<br/><br/>Both are sharing. Both are publishing. Whatever. The only distinction is whether or not currency changes hands. I fail to see how one must, as a matter of definition, change one's goals either way once money changes hands. I see many profitable, successful publishers who do not share the goals as you've defined them, for example.\n<blockquote>For one, the point of the act is to successfully engage in commerce with the fruits of a creative effort; for the other, the fruits of the creative effort is where it starts and ends.</blockquote>\nI don't buy it. That's what you say it is. Fine for you. Great. But, consider, if the goal of my commercial activity is not "to successfully engage in commerce with the fruits of a creative effort" does that make me Not-A-Businessman? I don't see it.<br/><br/>The goal of my commerical activity <i>uses commerce as a medium</i> to accomplish this: To get as many people as I'm able to play my games. Not buy them, play them. I am <i>able</i> to do that because the goal is not, for example, "be able to have health insurance." Which doesn't make me somehow "less" of a businessman. I just don't see that, either.<br/><br/>I read your businessman goal where commerce is the end of the goal. I define commerce as the means.<br/><br/>So, am I "publishing"? Of course. Are you? Certainly. <br/><br/>Similarly, your goal for "philosopher-artist" is flawed. It is not shared, not defitional.<br/><br/>My goal in creating a published (shared, whatever) thing is not to accomplish some "creative effort." I'm not especially sure what that means. <br/><br/>Among my goals as a "philosopher-artist" is creating stuff, sure. But, also among them, and indeed with greater priority, is affecting change in my hobby by designing, <i>publishing</i>, and encouraging people to do their hobby differently. That is, not only changing the way games get <i>played</i> but also the way the hobby accepts games (primarily, how they <i>buy</i> them and what they find "acceptable), how they use the books and materials they acquire, and how the hobby's social role may improve (er, in my eyes, that is).<br/><br/>I know others -- but certainly not everyone in the creator-owned scene -- who have similar goals. Indeed, the entire point of the creator-owned scene is ownership <i>so that one can decide what one's goals are</i>. EDIT: I'm not interested in whether that causes people to roll eyes that it's such a low bar of success or whatever. I just don't care.<br/><br/>And, yet, we routinely see angry dust ups here busting up the zen because people want to fight about what "real" business is. I do not see a fight. At all. What I see is arguments about identity politics, feeling threatened, posturing, and making sure the other fucking guy knows how smart and talented one is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126454/#Comment_126454" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T09:01:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  9:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Fred, what businessman/philosopher-artist divide?

Sorry, man.  But I've got a pledge with myself to ignore emotionally strident stuff, and I got that in the first three paragraphs.  I'm not looking to kick off an argument here, but you're sure as shit taking me up on that.  No deal.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>But as to the stuff in the first paragraph or so:<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, when Rob and I put out the free version of Fate, we weren't publishing it.  We were sharing it.<br/><br/>When we put out Don't Rest Your Head and Spirit of the Century -- investing much of our own money into it, and engaging in acts of commerce to make money from what we created -- that was when I felt we were <i>publishers</i>.<br/><br/>So the only inconsistency in what I'm saying is the one you're imagining needs to be there in order to support your reaction.  Again, sorry!  That's all on you.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I don't think it's deniable that money equals stress for a lot of people.  "Just adding money to the equation" is a terribly, terribly minimizing way to look at things.  I've discussed what's involved, financially, emotionally, impact-on-your-creativity-ly, etc, with transitioning from the no-money create-and-share activity and the commercial activity of publication at great length on my blog, and in this thread.  If you're not reading that, as I'm not reading you, great!  But your reaction is founded on a profound lack of information about my perspective.<br/><br/>Time to stop reading this thread, for me.

I'm not surprised that this community slips into it.  I'm happy that we generally follow that by taking a good look at things as they are, rather than as we've grown to perceive them, and readjusting our thinking.  That's why we're always telling each other that we're wrong ... because we are.

Honestly, I used to have the sense the designers who had "made it" were trying to keep me from doing the same thing, that they wouldn't accept me because I hadn't published something, and they kept describing more obstacles to the success of indie games, which felt like they kept raising the bar so as not to include me.</blockquote>\nFor me, it was the opposite. Like, almost everyone I talk to in this scene is ultracool. The guys at the Forge, back when I got into this in 2002, were so freaking friendly. It was great. Some people take things more seriously than others -- hell, I'm the most flippant person I know, I had radiation treatment for this tumor thing and I asked the nurse if it would give me powers, and she was like man what -- but that's cool. The point of my post was, I see all these cats, and they're like, "but should I publish? I read on some guy's blog that blah blah blah," and I'm like so what? Do what needs to be done. Teh intertubes is a rotten place to find your purpose.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>But that doesn't make the indie games scene The Man that must be rebelled against, not because it's some all encompassing blob that'll swallow you and your game up while chaning "One of us!

We are totally on the same page there. That's why I dug the Forge (wait, is the article capitalized? Is it "The Forge" or "the Forge"? Dammit!), and that's why I dig it here. Theory doesn't appeal to me, but I'm always interested in hearing about experiences. Best-practices discussion is the most powerful tool in the arsenal of the aspiring designer/publisher/whatever. My first game was pretty much built at Tha Forge (aha, that works, better email Ron), and that was mainly because there were all these great threads about printing and binding and artwork and layout and whatnot. Sure, my game looked like a used colostomy bag, but that's not the point. The point is, uh...<br/><br/>I like the cut of your jib, Walton.
