                    [Cross posted at The Forge]<br/><br/>Dragonmeet, in London, is a very friendly and successful one day convention that runs on the first Saturday of December. With 600 - 800 (approx.) attendees, there's a goodly number of people there playing games and browsing the trade hall.<br/><br/>This was the first year that <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com" rel="nofollow">The Collective Endeavour</a> had a presence there. Indeed, this was the first con that we would be at as a group to promote indie games in the UK. As well as demoing our own games, we were also on hand to talk about the full range of indie games that were being carried by the excellent Leisure Games, who had the stand right next to us. Brennan Taylor also kindly provided us with an Indie Press Revolution banner and postcards.<br/><br/>Our stand itself looked excellent, with the Collective Endeavour and IPR banner providing a backdrop and the tables dressed with appropriate red and black cloths, with handy clear racks for the books. Our conscious decision, taking note from The Forge booth at Gen Con, was to really engage with con attendees, standing in front of, rather than behind our stand, offering 15 minute demos and taking time to discuss games and gaming with people who came to the stand.<br/><br/>The result? An excellent first outing for The Collective Endeavour. Our sales were way beyond our expectations and the buzz around the stand was fantastic all day. Out of all the stands in the trade hall, ours definitely had the most enthusiasm and get up and go. People were enjoying demos, enjoying taking and buying games. There were also many opportunities to direct people to Leisure Games after they asked about (and this is just a small selection) My Life With Master, Burning Wheel, The Princes Kingdom and many others.<br/><br/>So how did the hard sales figures work out? Well, we took well over Â£900 (almost bang on $1800) during the eight hours the trade hall was open. Sales broke down as follows:<br/><br/>a|state: 3<br/>a|state Villains supplement: 4<br/>a|state PDF collection CD: 2<br/>Best Friends: 23<br/>Best Friends PDF CD: 7<br/>Best Friends poker chips: 6<br/>Cold City: 10<br/>Contenders: 7<br/>Covenant: 12<br/>Dead of Night: 14<br/>Mob Justice ashcan version: 1<br/>Swansong: 9<br/><br/>The outstanding sales success of the day was undoubtedly Best Friends, but all the titles we had showed good sales (I was even surprised to shift 3 copies of a|state, given the number of copies that we had sold a previous Dragonmeets). Cold City could have sold more, but sadly we only had 10 copies available due to shipping mishaps.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Dragonmeet was a great success for all of us. On a personal note, I'd like to thank Gregor Hutton, Andrew Kenrick, Matt Machell, Iain McAllister, Joe Prince, Cat Tobin and John Wilson for their hard work and enthusiasm throughout the day and in the run up to the convention.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>

Congrats, you guys! I'm glad that all of your games got some love, and that The Collective Endeavor had some presence and drummed up some support. You guys rock.<br/><br/>PDF CDs?!?!?!??!!?<br/><br/>Selling CDs of the PDFs sounds really, really cool. Can you tell me more about this amazing idea? What goes on the CD? Are there special "CD only" bonus features? Do you have a bunch of links to webpages on the CD (AP posts, design threads, etc)? What were people's reactions to them?                        </div>

                            The a|state CDs have all the pay-for PDFs you can buy at RPGnow and DriveThruRPG, as well as wallpapers and all the freebies available from the website. I think it's pretty handy and you get a good deal for your money. People seem to like the free stuff being all in one place on a CD and are willing to pay for the convenience, and while they'd maybe only buy one or two of the PDFs for sure online, they figure that the ones that were borderline for them to buy individually are worth it as part of a bulk deal. [In fact, Malcolm, thinking out loud, is it worth making a bulk deal of a|state stuff for sale from RPGnow and DTRPG for people new to the game?]<br/>
<br/>
They look nice (Paul did a great cover and CD booklet, as well as printing on the CD itself) and for people that don't have accounts online or internet connections it's a good way of getting support material.<br/>
<br/>
The Best Friends CDs had the RPGnow/DriveThru version of the game on them (includes wallpapers, playsheets, richly linked PDF of the game, and the text as an RTF file), as well as extra wallpapers, some advert PDFs, an MP3 of the Sons of Kryos demo (I figured some people might not have web access), and the 24 hour versions of Best Friends and 3:16. I also put some other stuff on like a high-res Kill Bargle video and PDFs of the free games from my website. They came in pink CD cases (mostly) and each one had a different circle-triangle girl drawn by me on the front, so they're kinda cutesy and unique.<br/>
<br/>
They were aimed at people who either picked up the book and thought "what the hell, give me the CD as well", or for folks who don't like paper. For me, they were quite cheap to make (as I've already done the hard work assembling the stuff for online retail earlier in the year), and I was pleased that my small run of CDs ran out at the con.<br/>
<br/>
I'd recommend it to any Indie designer to make up a few for sale at cons, they're extra income and there is a market for them.                        </div>

                            Hey guys, it was good to meet everyone last weekend.  Great to be able to put faces to names and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of quick questions:<br/>
<br/>
How much were people buying?  I mean, I know I had to put up a pretence of not wanting to buy everything for Claire's benefit, but if I'd been left to my own devices I'd probably have bankrupted myself and bought one of everything.  Did people mostly pick up one game after a demo, or did they tend to go "Sod it, I'll take the lot"?<br/>
<br/>
What was the ratio of "Who the hell are you guys?" vs "I've heard about this game online." vs "Ohhh, I really want this, gimmie!" ?<br/>
<br/>
I cannot state clearly enough how cute the Best Friends CDs looked.  I regret not buying that the same way I regret not eating the last few chips when I'm totally stuffed after a fine steak dinner.                        </div>

                            I picked up one of the Best Friend CDs (along with a bunch of other stuff both from the Collective and Leisure Games, if interested you can see my LJ post about the con <a href="http://nuclear-powered.livejournal.com/32217.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>) and my thought at the time was 'well, it's only an extra Â£2.50, I enjoyed the game and Gregor is a nice bloke, what the hell!'  The CDs <i>are</i> cute and cool as well and I certainly don't regret the purchase!<br><br>Other than that, yeah, it was a great day and it was very cool to meet the Collective, chat and play some cool demos.  I ended up picking up Covenant and Cold City as well as Best Friends and am looking forward to trying them all out sometime soon.                        </br></br></div>

Well, that's the big question, isn't it? :-)<br><br>In actual fact, we have pretty solid plans about where to take this, and the excellent first time out at Dragonmeet has only reinforced this. In the interim, the plan is to grow the CE website as a community and some good discussion going on there. There's already a couple of game sin develoment being posted about, so that's a great start. The site is also being used to set up small indies games meetups throughout the UK, with Matt machell taking the lead in this and organising one for the Midlands.<br><br>As far as conventions go, the next one we will have representation at will be Conception in Bournemouth in January, followed by Conflagration in Glasgow at the end of February. Then there is Conpulsion in Edinburgh in March, followed by the re-vitalised (hopefully) Gen Con UK in Reading and the new UK Games Expo over the course of the summer.<br><br>Our aim is to make the CE stand a feature of UK cons, where people can pitch up, try demos, talk about games, get advice on publishingor any other game related matter and, yes, maybe even buy a game or two. As with anything, we can't stand still and hopefully we'll see other indie publishers from the UK joining us on the stand as things progress. <br><br>With the website and our success at Dragonmeet, I think we've built a really solid base for future success.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            There were some people that picked up almost one of everything, but most picked 2 games or so I think. Dead of Night, Covenant and Cold City were quick out the traps in the morning. I certainly felt that the first people to make a bee-line for the booth had heard of them online and just wanted to buy them. Best Friends and Contenders were slower to get going at first -- Best Friends really started selling well in the afternoon (hats off to Graham for running his game of it, and I figure that the demos helped too -- none of the 4 sucked which was great).<br/>
<br/>
As for the demos? Well, the other guys won't say anything publicly negative about the BF ones so I will. One of them was 40 mins long, which is way too long. I should have been more on the ball about that, but guys, you should also have booted me off. So something for us all to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand two of the demo games couldn't in any way have been done in 15 mins. I had 8 players on one and 7 on another and you can't pregen characters. I think Swansong is maybe another that needs some explanation time too.<br/>
<br/>
I've also had some feedback that some of the congoers wanted more than just a "bang!" 15-min demo (they felt those are too rushed in the more laid-back UK environment). I'm sympathetic to their argument, and perhaps a 20-30 minute demo wouldn't have killed us.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure on keeping demos short at Indy is that there is a lot of pressure on table space. I felt that there was less of this on our tables.<br/>
<br/>
I also ran a Best Friends demo at the end of the con where we kept the players at the table and got Joe to do a Contenders one to the same group. In hindsight maybe it would have worked better if we'd split the large table into 2 Contenders demos and got them all slugging it out.                        </div>

Having been one of the players in those 2 demos I have to say that you're probably right.  My personal feeling was that the Contenders demo suffered from having so many people involved.  I didn't feel involved in the majority of the demo, a fact that left me feeling reasonably indifferent about the game in the end.  Still, Jan (short guy with a wolf jumper who went to lunch with us) picked up a copy so I'll be forcing him to run it sometime soon!                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite> Any idea how Leisure Games did?  What was selling there?</blockquote>
They certainly had a slowly decreasing stock of Indie games over the day (I had a browse myself!) I know somebody I spoke to was glad to have nabbed their last copy of Hero's Banner. I chatted to a few folks about everything from CoS and Prince's Kingdom, so there was definitely lots of interest.                        </div>

                            I purchased a few things from Leisure Games at the start of the day, namely PTA, Nine Worlds, Shooting the Moon and Hero's Banner.  On of my friends purchsed some other stuff including My Life with Master and Mortal Coil (he grabbed some other bits but I can't recall what now.)  There were 2, hardcover copies of Spirit of the Century there at the start of the day, they didn't last long though!  (I'd have bagged one but couldn't really justify Â£30 for a game at that point, ~Â£10/game, OTOH, was all good!)                        </div>

                            The "annotated kpfs" is the last print version of it (from GenCon 2005 if I recall) that has kpfs and cockroach souffle together in one book, along with some comments from vincent in the margins at the bottom of the pages. I'm not sure what it's availability is like at the moment from Vincent.<br/>
<br/>
The Best Friends poker chips are just some nice pink poker chips, but seeing as they did well (I sold out of my 6 batches) I'm considering getting more with some sort of Best Friends branding on them. I'm guessing that would be of interest to some of you.<br/>
<br/>
Leisure Games was doing a roaring trade in Indie RPGs and speaking to Angus I can only see his IPR and other indie orders being more regular and with more volume. At least one other UK shop also showed an interest in stocking Indie Games on the back of the con from what I gather.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I think it really helped that we were all aware of each other's games. So we were able to pitch them effectively even if the writer wasn't there. So for anyone looking to see if small group "squads" work at cons, I'd say "yes".                        </div>

I'd certainly second Gregor on this. The great thing was that we all knew each others games. Even if we couldn't demo them, we could confidently pitch them to customers and answer follow-up questions. How this will change as the CE presence at cons expands and the number of games on sale grows, I don't know. But for now, the group that we have works extremely well together. Even when (through a bit of brain freeze on my part) only Matt and I were left on the stand for a bit at lunchtime (Joe and Marie turned up from there lunch a short while later), we could still carry out our jobs effectively and tell people what they wanted to know about everything from a|state to Swansong.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></div>

                            The booth was buzzing the whole con and I felt there were fewer quiet periods than last year. The double booth also gave us space to breathe and spread out the books.<br/>

It was a great team effort by everyone. It's a shame Iain had to leave early to go back to Edinburgh, as the pub afterwards was good fun too.                        </div>

                            Yeah I will definetley come for longer next year. Events conspired against me this time around. I really enjoyed meeting people and talking to folks like Andrew, who I haven't met before, and Matt who I haven't seen for a while. There was a really good buzz around the stall all day and it was interesting talking to some people who had been out of gaming for a while and were coming back to it through the indie scene. Kudos to Gregor on his sales of Best Friends. Nice to see something so different from the normal RPG fare doing so well.<br><br>All the best<br>Iain                        </br></br></br></div>

Oh, well, yes, good question.<br><br>I started the day with a demo of Swansong, which was a lot of fun, especially in the Elizabethan setting which Joe used; then I played Paranoia XP (Paranoia is my favourite game in the world), which was good, but the GM didn't use one of the most interesting parts of the new system, which was a shame; then, finally, I ran Best Friends, and that just knocked the ball out of the park. Really, that's not some sort of support-your-fellow-designer spiel: it was an amazing game. People left very happy afterwards.<br><br>I have a <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> about Dragonmeet, actually, which says all that but in more detail.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I got to play some Savage Worlds, which was novel.  Novel because I've been running that since February and it was neat to actually get to kill some things and take their stuff for a change.  Also, it was Dave Blewer's upcoming Sundered Skies setting run by the author himself, which was pretty cool.<br/><br/>I also bought too much stuff, spoke to Marcus Rowland about Elvis: The Legendary Tours and a few people about various boardgames.  And someone collared me to help work on a game I can't talk about.                        </div>
