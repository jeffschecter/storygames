That lack of knowledge made for some delicious dialogues, orc NPCs vs human PCs. They had a near catastrophic misunderstanding about some "gifts", giving away much of their equipment, and were hard pressed to correct the misunderstanding with little common language-ground to stand on with the orcs.<br/><br/>And then they met with some <i>dwellers</i> (dwarves), who had crippled servants that spoke "human", but with some twinges that made it difficult. The fact that the dwellers themselves, in all their powerful iron-glory, stood as stoney witnesses to the dialogue, made it even more unnerving and difficult.<br/><br/>Making nonsensical sounds when talking for the orcs and dwellers, as they talked amongst themselves, made it even more fun for me as a GM, and contributed to the character/player feeling of being out on thin ice ...<br/><br/>Fun to do! <br/><br/>Do you have experiences to share with us, on the use of language in roleplaying games, particularly strange languages, limping use of everyday words, and more or less bad translations?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357490/#Comment_357490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T05:40:48+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  5:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've experimented with this here and there.<br/><br/>I do love wrapping players up on the "There's really no word for that on this language, but there's a similar one which also means [male sex organ]."  The double entendres are enough to trip players up.<br/><br/>And I'll throw in a bad "They're killing my men left and correct" type mistranslation when someone clever has given me a good example and I remember to write it down.<br/><br/>Still, my favorite language stuff is committing the players to some deed or exaggerating some great offense when a roll is failed/botched, an then justifying it linguistically.

The script was highly amenable to being scratched into writing surfaces by any being with four claws, and I arranged for an appropriately Lovecraftian inventory of too many consonants and not enough vowels, plus really promiscuous phonotactic rules. I did it to engage one of my less-enthusiastic players, who was a linguistics student, and she really enjoyed it - and that made everyone else have a better time, and got a few of them interested in how languages are deciphered in real life. So that was a lot of success for a half-hour of prep, and I've kept using it for flavor in games I've run since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_357653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357653/#Comment_357653" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T15:30:20+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  3:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2012 3:32PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game some years ago, where I introduced a sociolect called "porcelainsh". It was simple; in high circles you spoke porcelainsh, or you would not be listened to. and porcelainsh was like everyday speak, but with lots of foreign words, that we found in a dictionary, and gave meanings by rolling a die and counting down in the dictionary (adopting the meaning we found there). We built up quite a vocabulary this way, and had great fun using it. <br/><br/>But of course; <i>expanding</i> the vocabulary made for some sweet misunderstandings (and hilarious situations full of danger ...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
