Does anyone have any suggestions for good story game designers to interview?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about interviewing Tim Klinert about The Mountain Witch. However its been difficult to find his contact info. He is listed as time@timfire.com where ever i can find him, however timefire.com does not exist anymore. Is anyone in contact with Tim who could introduce us?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
