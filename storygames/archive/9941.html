You and your friends will create vibrant exciting tales where the activities within the story push the narrative forward. You'll take a primitive stance on creating stories to immerse yourself in ways that are both natural and original. And while you're listening to your friends' narration, you'll be able to introduce disturbances which can change the plot of the story in fun and unexpected ways. Easy to learn rules and no character creation means you'll be ready to play in a few minutes</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThat was my blurb by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goals for Radiance was to create a game where the world takes precedence over any characters. To move away from Cartesian dualism (mind/body, subject/object, self/world) and create something more Heideggarian (characters are in the world and the world is primary, personhood is revealed through ongoing activity rather than choice being a consequence of character) I was influenced by childhood tales such as the Billy Goats Gruff, ancient stories, and some hunches I have about oral cultures and storytelling. Other influences come from animism (anything can be a character as long as it is involved in an activity: fight with a sword that doesn't like you and you may find yourself in trouble, climb a mountain that demands a sacrifice before it will allow you to reach the top and it may cast you down, release a balloon on a playful breeze and that balloon may guide you somewhere magical, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRadiance has no setting other than what players give it.

It's what you get when you remove hundreds of years of bullshit theory and analysis out of story and return to the roots of storytelling. And it creates vibrant exciting stories because it works the way that we normally tell stories to ourselves and one another.<br><br>Activities don't push the story forward in most games. Characters make decisions and these move the story forward. You start with characters thinking about what they should do and then you get activity. Which is the reverse of how things should be. In Radiance you start with activities and these activities reveal the characters present within them. <br><br>So how about this for the blurb...<br><br><i>Nearly everything you've been taught about creating stories is a lie. Maybe you think the characters you create matter, that their motives and beliefs makes a difference. Maybe you think that stories are about people making choices, developing from those choices, and resolving some internal issue. Or maybe you think that the stories are about people facing challenges and overcoming obstacle. If that's what you think, you've arrived too late, everyone's gone home, party's over. Radiance is a game which takes you to the primitive roots of storytelling. You'll tell stories where the world you create and the activities you narrate within that world are primary and elemental. Stories where anything can become a character. And while you're listening to your friends' narration, you'll be able to introduce disturbances which can change the plot of the story in fun and unexpected ways.</i> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220884/#Comment_220884" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T05:01:21+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  5:01AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, now we're talking.

Go back far enough or look at how other cultures perceive things and there is no internal/external dichotomy; your thoughts, feelings, beliefs aren't private experiences inside of you, they happen in the world. In many RPGs the dichotomy between internal/external, subject/object, character/world is present in the way that characters are created separately from the world rather than with the world. Radiance is primitive and elemental because it goes back to earlier ways of thinking about how we relate to our world. <br/><br/>You're right about being confrontational and I've also enjoyed the same things as you.

You need an image with copy space.</p>\n<p>Here are some:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://photoxpress.com/Content/water-green-tree/3444172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://photoxpress.com/Content/water-green-tree/3444172</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-6599661-concept-vector-illustration-history-book.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-6599661-concept-vector-illustration-history-book.php</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-4642929-open-book-on-black-background.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-4642929-open-book-on-black-background.php</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-9846762-ancient-storytelling.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-9846762-ancient-storytelling.php</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>They aren't all forests, but let's be honest here - the only <em>identity</em> you have to work with is <em>the action of storytelling.</em> If you're not going to highlight that in your cover image, your cover isn't doing any work and it doesn't matter what it is.</p>\n<p>Were I designing this cover, I'd probably go and look at, uh, academic journals, books of essays, "classics" editions of old novels, etc etc for inspiration. It seems like you're providing something very dry that calls for a lot of player investment and focus to make it into something awesome, so you should use the visual language of things that require a lot of reader effort.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221021/#Comment_221021" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T15:36:43+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  3:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a graphic designer, but have you considered using a photo of a campfire for the cover?

But if for some reason, you feel like a photo of a stream and woods with no people really exemplifies a game about the primal roots of storytelling, go back to the full original shot and fix the contrast. Or send it to me, and I'll do it for you, if you like.<br><br>I'd strongly suggest looking at a stock photography site, or even Flickr, and searching the word "storytelling" if you've got no conceptual idea of what your cover should be. Chances are excellent that someone has already conceptualized "storytelling" in a way that you think will match well with your game. Even if you find an image that's too expensive for your current budget, you'll have found a concept, and then you can make a cover that actively works to sell your game and what it does.<br><br>I'm not saying you have to spend a ton of money, but I am saying you should spend <i>enough</i> money. For a lot of people, your cover will be the game's introduction and first impression. What the cover says matters. But, like I said, if you're really hell-bent on that photo, let me know if I can help you make it a bit more cover-ready.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221220/#Comment_221220" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T16:04:40+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  4:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, if you have 40 bucks for a cover (and I know not everyone does) I would hell of encourage you to take a strong look at this:<br><br/><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-6386262-inspiration.php" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www1.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/6386262/2/istockphoto_6386262-inspiration.jpg"/></a> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221339/#Comment_221339" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T02:14:40+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  2:14AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 2:15AM by MJGraham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, Shreyas and Guy.

There is a lot more to graphic design than just knowing how to use software. A lot of it has to do with spending years looking at design and thinking "this is great because" or "this is shit because." A lot has to do with understanding how to use the principles and elements elements of design.<br/><br/>I like the last cover the best, and the fact that there is Papa Legba's veve on the cover makes me want to check out the game. <br/><br/>Don't break up the word. Don't use two sans-serif typefaces together. Don't use a font because you think it looks cool, but rather because it enhances the flavor of the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
