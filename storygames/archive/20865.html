Do you think your game, which didn't have much scheming and in which the regalia never changed hands, is typical? Also, when you say it is like Fiasco, do you mean it is similar mechanically or in another way?

Due to some of the language in the rules, I thought it was going to be competitive, with some opposed player striving, and some uncertainty about whether you can seize roles or not.  In reality, it's much more choice-driven than that.  You just grab GM duties from the GM more or less when you feel like it, at least relative to what I'd imagined before playing.  The result is satisfyingly unique, allowing you to gradually reconfigure the creative roles at the table over the course of a session.  <br/><br/>Beyond that:<br/><br/>\u2022 The template situations (types of Kings? I can't remember the terms, it's been a few years) are all full of good inspiration.<br/><br/>\u2022 I remember the system being simple and allowing my group to tell fun stories with ease.<br/><br/>\u2022 That's about the whole deal!  Not a ton of system to discover.  As a neophile, the main thing to explore is the "seize GMing" dynamic.  Otherwise, just have fun telling stories of shifting power dynamics.<br/><br/>\u2022 Maybe there could be something deeper to the experience of changing player roles corresponding to changing fictional developments and character roles... but I didn't experience that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458051/#Comment_458051" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T03:30:35+00:00" title="November 13, 2016  3:30AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a><br/>Nice, thanks for all the info on the game and system:)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458052/#Comment_458052" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T08:53:45+00:00" title="November 13, 2016  8:53AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you think your game, which didn't have much scheming and in which the regalia never changed hands, is typical?</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure it isn't. That's like a game of D&amp;D where no attack rolls are rolled! That happened because of how the relationships between the main characters and their in-the-moment priorities ended up, but I'm confident it was quite a unique occurrence.\n<blockquote>Also, when you say it is like Fiasco, do you mean it is similar mechanically or in another way?</blockquote>\nI mean the general feeling of how the game played out! Mechanically it's a bit simpler, with no dice rolling or any other random elements involved.<br/><br/>I do think it's a neatly designed game and one I'm definitely going to play again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
