Based on the excitement of the players during and after the 4-hour game, I can safely say that it rocked. It was a pretty bog-standard D&amp;D fighty adventure, so I am wondering what made it so fun.<br/><br/>I think a large part of it is atmosphere. Metrocalypse is, at the end of the day, just a setting, a justification for all the weird stuff in D&amp;D. Its magic is making the player characters come from a more normal place -- in this case, 1605 Oxford, England -- and dumping them into the world and "forcing" upon them terrible transformations and dropping them into a terribly dangerous jungle that swallows the city. Conveying that atmosphere is one of my most important jobs as Dungeon Master.<br/><br/>Atmosphere occupied my mind during the game. In the prior game, when the PCs crossed from Christ Church Cathedral (their home base) to the Bear Inn on Alfred Street (the Mayor's home base), I turned the travel into a random encounter. I wanted to make the players understand that travel was dangerous. In last week's game, I realized that they'd be frustrated by a constant onslaught of random encounters whenever they wanted to move around the city. Still, I wanted them to feel how dangerous travel was.<br/><br/>My solution was to tell them it was dangerous with a little exposition. I described the jungle-clogged streets in some detail. The forest canopy was higher than it was a couple weeks ago, I said. The underbrush was full of choker vines, razor-edged weeds, and carnivorous plants -- not to mention all kinds of monsters. "Just assume that whenever you travel, you have to kill stuff," I explained. "It's never an easy journey."  I also described how line-of-sight was so limited, that sometimes they'd walk into the walls of buildings before they realized they were there. Every house and shop was like a hidden ruin, waiting to be discovered in the forest.<br/><br/>I'd prepared a handful of quest cards, 4"x6" note cards with minor and major quests printed on them. Each quest has a name, a minor/major designation, an indication of the quest's level and XP reward, a short description, plus hints about the treasure available on the quest. I am going to enhance them further to explain what kinds of encounters each quest has, so the group can choose what kind of play they want. For example, a quest might offer "2 small combat encounters, 1 long role-playing encounter, and 1 short skill challenge." The group looked over the cards and chose one of my favorites, which involved eradicating some giant ants.<br/><br/>With atmosphere on my mind, I had them come upon an ant scouting party (2 worker/minions, 2 warriors, 2 drones). During the combat, I described the pincer attacks, the acid burns, and the chemical smells (these ants communciate through pheremones). It was a short encounter.<br/><br/>The largest encounter was an ant work party (12 workers, 2 warriors, 2 soldiers, 1 drone). I drew out the battle map with a 20-foot-wide street and 25-30-foot buildings aside it, with several 5-foot alleys between buildings. The players' eyes widened as I dropped the 15 pogs on the table. Unfortunately, I hadn't prepared ant pogs, so I was using kobolds. I regret that but I didn't have the wooden cut-outs. I've ordered some (should arrive soon, I hope) and I have printed and punched a bunch of really creepy ant art for next time! The worker ants were tearing down the buildings, log by log and stone by stone. I drew giant piles of rubble around buildings on the map.<br/><br/>The ants have a special ability that allows all of them to shift 2 squares whenever an ant dies. Man, it's creepy when 14 ants all skitter when one dies. The PCs' clever battle positions were constantly overrun by ants that could burrow under them, shift around them, or climb the buildings. I managed to convey the impression of a swarm of giant insects.<br/><br/>I ended the game with a preview of next week (this Thursday). They followed the ant trail to the northwest corner of the city. The ants have created a 100-foot-tall mountain of rubble with cave entrances in it. It's swarming with giant ants. They need to penetrate the depths of the mound and kill the ant queen. If all goes well, they hope to score some <i>royal jelly</i>, which has magical healing properties (I decided).<br/><br/>For next time, I have a few techniques I want to add. First of all, I want to convey urban decay. In every scene, I will include one bit of narration about buildings and visibility in the woods. I will also mention one or two bits of humanity that have been left behind: a wooden toy on the ground, a table set for dinner but left to rot, a shoe stuck in the mud, a stack of papers. If I can get just a couple of these tidbits into every scene, the world will be richer for it. Second, I will have the players take turns describing what they encounter in each travel scene. I don't want them to take travel lightly. If I remind them that it's scary by letting them narrate spooky and dangerous cut-scenes, they can take part in the building of atmosphere.<br/><br/><i>Crossposted to <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/244044.html" rel="nofollow">my LiveJournal</a></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222205/#Comment_222205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T09:50:53+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  9:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very interested in other techniques people have for conveying atmosphere.

One of the best tools I've found for containing atmosphere is an LED lightbulb we dug up on thinkgeek with remote-controlled color and brightness options. It's really nice to, at the touch of a button, cycle to the appropriate colors of a room, or darken the light as characters go deeper into catacombs. This has been especially useful in Lacuna; dark blue and black clearance take on a whole new meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222379/#Comment_222379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T07:35:02+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  7:35AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a cool idea.

It requires the right kind of humorlessness and depth of play, so it definitely isn't for everyone.

When I ran My Life with Master at my house, I experimented with putting a lit candle (in a glass globe) on the middle of the table and turning off lights one at a time over the course of play. It got darker and darker. It helped that there was rain, thunder, and lightning outside. It also helped that my wife pounded on the door (a frantic, "gah, let me in because I'm getting soaked") at a tense moment and scared everyone witless. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222490/#Comment_222490" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T14:15:17+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  2:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>For next time, I have a few techniques I want to add.

Since 4E combat thrives on interesting terrain, see if you can flavor all of your encounter terrain like the above, with smashed treehouses, pub wreckage, improvised acqueducts, etc, etc.<br/><br/>For navigating across a hazardous environment, a skill challenge also seems apropos.  Mike Mearls has some navigating-across-the-city skill challenges in a recent Dungeon mag.  For races against time you can limit the number of rolls per character so that people have to really think about Aiding Another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222511/#Comment_222511" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T16:02:50+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh. Thanks for the reminder about Mearls' DDI articles about city crossing. I'll have to look those up again.<br/><br/>I do try to use the terrain in interesting ways for encounters. Mostly, the players aren't biting. I'll have to be more explicit (the way John Stav. is) about what characters can do with the terrain features. I love your suggestions for /new/ city features (treehouses, aqueducts). Stolen. <br/><br/>As a side note, though I was describing all of the street terrain as hard to pass through, during encounters I totally decided it wasn't difficult terrain. That would just make every encounter boring. I may back up a bit and make explicit clearings and have areas of difficult terrain around the edges, but I've sorta done that in the ant encounter with the rubble falling down around the buildings.<br/><br/>Appreciate your consult.

I didn't take Acrobatics and Athletics for nothing!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like using music but I have trouble finding good music for D&amp;D.; Dark Heresy, I had a metal mix for combat, I had a low level ambient mix for normal play, and I had a ambient noise mix for demons and other icky things. I also used the same song for an intro every game, with the same narrative text, to establish ritual. But it's harder for D&amp;D.; Renaissance Games has movie soundtracks going in their gaming space, which on one hand is cool but when it's the LotR soundtrack everyone's pulled a bit out of the experience since it's familiar music with other associations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current self-assigned GMing task for atmosphere: describe a smell in every scene, cause I'm lousy at adding senses other than sight to my descriptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mixed emotions about narrative control when you're trying to creep out players, because control detracts from creepiness.
