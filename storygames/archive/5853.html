That's a little bit like what you're getting at here, but less competitive.  It's more about resource management than the possibility of failure.  People still fail, but only intentionally or because they have no resources left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130926/#Comment_130926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T12:09:09+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 12:09PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2008 12:10PM by Nathan_H.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, do you think it would horribly effect play?<br/>\nlike how would Harm work?<br/>\nyou'd just have a flat penalty, right?<br/>\nor you could probably just treat Harm as it is.<br/>\ni like the idea of fairly blatant player created suspense.<br/>\n...taking the roll of suspense away from dice, which is kinda shallow, and harder for me to invest in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130941/#Comment_130941" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T12:32:09+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 12:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the resolution mechanics would rely on unspoken negotiations between the GM and players more.  Like the difficulty that the GM sets and the strength of the players' desire to succeed become the critical parts of resolution.  Less random and more arbitrary, but with the arbitrariness shared between GM and players.  I'm not sure how much that would effect the events that occured in play, but it would surely change the feel of resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130955/#Comment_130955" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T12:56:05+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 12:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one obvious issue:<br/><br/>You're going to have some wrangling with the Transcendence rules.

I thought he meant the former.<br/><br/>In regular TSOY, it doesn't matter how many bonus dice you have, you'll never transcend unless you're already a Grand Master. In this variation, if you were rolling dice, it could happen on many more rolls. For example, if your skill is 2, anytime you spend two or more tokens, you risk Transcending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131086/#Comment_131086" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T20:38:19+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  8:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you make a good point Paul.<br/>\ni didn't even think about the whole Transcendence thing.<br/>\nand yeah, i was thinkin' you'd still use the three Fudge dice, and any extra dice from Pools or Gifts would instead be +1 tokens.<br/>\ni like tSoY enough as is...i just like to think aloud sometimes.<br/>\nthere's something to the players hiding resources thing...<br/>\nPaul, can't you spend only one die from a Pool, and also maybe a Gift die?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
