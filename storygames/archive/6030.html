Elements of content can be anything from story elements to things like the GM asking a player to roll the dice.<br/><br/>A roleplaying session is made up of people introducing content to the game. Usually that means that the GM introduces many-many prepared content and all players (inclusively the GM) adlib some content while playing.<br/><br/>Let's have a look at this act of content generating. The adventure writing is somewhat complex, so its discussion will be postponed. Now it is time for the adlibbed content.<br/><br/>Basically in a classic session there are two types of adlibbed content: the player's character decisions and the GMs reactions to the player's decisions. <br/><br/>How is a player's decesion (an adlibbed content element) generated? First, the player looks at the content element just introduced into the game, then looks at the prepared character. The relation of these two content elements will generate the decision. (Of course the generation needs the creativity of a human being.)<br/><br/>How is a GM's decision (an adlibbed content element) generated? First, the GM looks at the instructions of the adventure (wich is a prepared content element) and/or the situation the PCs are in and then looks at the just introduced player's decision (wich is an adlibbed content element). The relation of these content elements generate the decision. (The human creativity is needed here, too.)<br/><br/><br/><b>What's common in these content element generations?</b><br/><br/>Every generated content element is generated by two other content elements. Note, that content elements don't have to be part of the active content wich is known by all the players. Content elements can be part of the thoughts of only one player.<br/><br/>Then why is it practically important that a new content element is generated by two other content elements if any player can have any content in their heads? Because it is always quicker to generate new contents from existing ones. If you have to wait for your ideas, that means that you risk that maybe nothing will come to your mind in the session.<br/><br/>The more content you can generate the better. You don't have to introduce every possibly generated content into the game if it would harm, but the more the possibility, the better you can choose.<br/><br/><br/><b>Fruitful Content</b><br/><br/>So you generate content by looking two or more conent elements and then generate a new one based upon their constellation. But content elements differ in how fruitful they are. For example if you wait for your ideas, that can be very random. If you consistently look for content elements to generate new content, that's better than to wait for an idea from nowhere. But the best are those content elements wich automatically generate more content because of their nature.<br/><br/>For example the personality of a character is a content like that. It makes a pair with every situation the character gets into. But even better if you can describe a character as short as you can. For example if an NPC is all about 'I endure everything and everyone should pity me.', that means you can follow this only one sentence without knowing the thorough personality of a character. It not only gives birth to character decisions, but generates probable situations or memories that the character likely has. You don't have to flesh that out, because it gets fleshed out automatically while playing.<br/><br/>If you consider to use more fruitful content elements, you can spare many work when writing an adventure.<br/><br/><br/><b>Introducing Contents is Communication</b><br/><br/>The history of roleplaying makes us (the players) difficult to talk about preferences and if we do often miscommunicate or just say vague things that don't mean enough for each other. (For example: 'We want excitment.' or 'We want a good story.' mean nothing to the GM if players say things like these.)<br/><br/>But the content elements introduced by players mean business. Of course even this type of communication is distorted somewhat, but not as much as the out of game communication. For example if the player at character developement when - has freely to choose wich skills to raise - raises fencing, that means that the player is awaiting or is preparing for fencing itself.<br/><br/>Note, that these are different content elements: the raise of the skill and the use of the skill and the skill itself are three different things.<br/><br/>You, as a GM, can react to the introduced contents. For example if the player raises a value of the character, you should introduce trials of the very value into the adventure. It is just trivial to introduce battle if there are fighters among the characters.<br/><br/>But this also works on other types of content elements. If for example a character is lazy, you can play on it by inventing a situation where lazyness is a problem OR lazyness is the solution.<br/><br/>If we step one more step, we can say, that it is even logical to assume that it works with adlibbed contents, too. If a player attacks on spot an enemy without consideration, you can introduce more fights even in the same session. That gives even shy players some achievement, because the story bends as they want it.<br/><br/><br/><b>Teaching the Players</b><br/><br/>The GM has to 'teach' the players communicate using the content elements, if there is a traditional GM role in the game. Unless the game has to teach the players the communication. What does that mean?<br/><br/>That means two main things:<br/><br/>1. The players may assume that they 'have to' do some decisions. That there are better decisions and there are worse decisions. For example some player may argue that in a fantasy setting it is wise to have some skill in physical combat, wich causes them to raise the combat skills while they don't want at all to fight, they're just afraid that they will meet combat trials. All the players have to know all their possibilities.<br/><br/>2. The other important thing is information. If a player doesn't know some important information, than the player can't make real decisions. The game becomes random. It is important that every player gets to know every content wich has been introduced to the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134952/#Comment_134952" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T14:37:59+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!

That is, players also take into account the "Adventure" or "situation" and the GM also takes into account the characters. No, the players don't have access to the details of the adventure in traditional play... but they do have some sense of it. Is this an adventure that is about saving a princess? Then my decision to pick flowers in this scene may have nothing to do with what the GM just presented about the scene, but everything to do with the expectation that we might meet the princess later. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the GM, knowing that I like to have my character fight, may respond by having an NPC from the adventure be more beligerent than the scenario text indicates, so we can get into a fight. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically it's not just in-game content that forms the decision, but game participants also understand to some extent what the other participants want, and this informs the decision-making process to some extent. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I agree with your concept of "Teaching the Players." In that it's important to have an agreement between all of the game participants regarding expectations of what the game will be about. But I'd argue that if you have a good system, it does this "teaching" (I'd call it agreeing), for you to some extent. I've found that it's only when you try to use the system to do something that it's not for, that you get this sort of confusion. The obvious example being using D&amp;D to do other than tactical fun. In your example, what's probably confusing the players is not so much a lack of communication as to what the goals might be, as the game communicating to them that combat will be important. Yes, if you go against that grain, you'd probably want to "teach" some. But I'd argue you'd be better off simply playing a system that communicated your goal for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135386/#Comment_135386" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T10:45:33+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 10:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2008 10:45AM by Max Higley.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In principle, you can get any complex combination of content by combining two pieces at a time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135442/#Comment_135442" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T16:42:37+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  4:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for the feedback.<br/><br/>Mike,<br/><br/>I think I wasn't clear enough. Of course new content can be generated from more than two other elements. The other thing is, that under content elements I understand functions, wich don't have to be in-game. (I think the Big Model calls this the ephemera, but I wouldn't like to debate about Big Model in this thread, just for clarification.) So if you know something about your player, that's an element of content, too, except it's not active content, but peripherical content. (I'm using here Mendel's jargon from PCon3, wich can be worked into here for my big surprise.) I still don't know whether I should call that a function.<br/><br/>The other thing that I was very much simplifying things. And I don't think I really can write a normative essay myself in English. Maybe I should make up more examples. Some of them are coming right now.<br/><br/><br/>Chris,<br/><br/>I wrote an adventure for Aeon Trinity. It started with an Aberrant (they are the bad guys) attack on a space station. The PCs quest was to do some research on the case. They soon realized that an important thing was stolen from the station under the attack. The important part of this is the survivors who could be questioned. I wrote the adventure the night before the game, so I didn't have much time, but I had to make up some NPCs besides the thief (or it would've been to easy).<br/><br/>So, I asked myself: what was happening? They were under attack by the strongest badasses in this world. The important word here is: survival strategies. I decided to make up as many survival strategy as I can and each will become an NPC. The strategies were:<br/>- stepping on others<br/>- 'We should stay together!'<br/>- 'We need a plan!'<br/>- 'It's all over. I lie down here to die.'<br/>- 'We have to face our enemy.'<br/>- 'I endure everything.' (and make others pity me)<br/>- 'Time will tell. I flow with the current.'<br/><br/>These are seed elements wich help me generate content. I started to prepare some content before play, so I chose etnics, allegiance, description and some history based upon these. Here you can see the facts I deducted in the order of deduction.<br/><br/>Mike Hastings<br/>- Under the attack he took away an oxygenpack killing other people doing so. (It's derived from the survival strategy + the situation of the attack.)<br/>- He worked before only in earthside offices. (The inexperience made him do this terrible decision.)<br/>- Orgotek assigned him as project leader. (And of course he needs to be as high ranking as possible.)<br/>- FSA citizen (This comes from Orgotek.)<br/><br/>Julia Delgado<br/>- She gathered most of the survivors. (It's derived from the strategy + the situation.)<br/>- Orgotek technican. (She has to be mundane and walk on Earth with her feet.)<br/><br/>George Baker<br/>- He guided the survivors to a shuttle to escape. (From strategy + situation.)<br/>- He was former a technician, now he's a team leader. (To emphasize that he is practical and tactical.)<br/><br/>Jerome Forbes<br/>- He hid in a closet with a gun and waited for his destiny (from strategy + situation)<br/>- until Julia and the others found him. (from Julia's content)<br/>- He is a research scientist. (To be weak. He drifted away too much into science and got physically and emotionally weak.)<br/>- He understand how the stolen thing works. (from 'research scientist' and the nature of stolen thing already established)<br/>- He works for Orgotek. (from scientist)<br/>- FSA citizen. (from Orgotek)<br/><br/>Rick McCormick<br/>- He would've gone to a suicide attack (from strategy + situation),<br/>- but George stopped him from doing so. (from he survived + George's strategy)<br/>- He set up traps for the attackers. (from his strategy + George's strategy)<br/>- He works for the Legions. (from strategy)<br/>- He is Australian. (from Legions)<br/><br/>Maria Schr\xf6ter<br/>- She's the thief. (She likes when others pity her and she likes to pity what she stole. So she wanted to save it.)<br/>- She's a technician whose job was to set theup some apps belonging to the scientific thingy.<br/>- She was an airport controller (The story said the stolen thing was shout out into space to pirates. The best place to know some pirates is to be an airport controller.)<br/>- on a moonbase. (The pirates are space pirates, so the airport was on the moon.)<br/>- Had a bad childhood. (From strategy. She has to be pitied and every part of her asks for pity. Even her past.)<br/><br/>Nika Jamatta<br/>- She walked through the battlefield luckily without getting hit. (From strategy.)<br/>- Clairsentient. (They mostly like the named strategy.)<br/>- Member of ISRA. (clairsentient)<br/><br/>The important thing is: I didn't have to think about these things at all. These were all very much evident from the strategies and what I knew about the setting with some extrapolation. And when playing I could easily adlib the answers of the NPCs and the detailed facts of the attack.

That's a hard question.<br/><br/>I think that depends on the game. I did right in my adventure, because I could write it about morality. But if you are playing D&amp;D with delicate power balance of the characters, you should/could totally use Encounter Level as one of the fruitful functions. (You put the monsters in CR order and can choose among them easily when preparing or even on the fly.)<br/><br/>If I think about it, most players require some details about the world, wich means that some adjectives regarding the daily lives of the people should help you generate detailed discriptions of the surroundings - if you derive architect from that (customs + region), you can even make up maps for combat on the fly (from place + architect).<br/><br/>This means you have to decide beforehand what do you want to speak about while playing. If you don't have any fruitful content wich generates the things required while playing, you have a problem. So you have to guide the players not to ask about those things. This is similar to (or maybe even encompass) the defense of the genre. For example if you're playing Star Wars, you mustn't speak about technical details. Or when you are playing fantasy, you mustn't talk about relativistic physics. There should be some method of discouraging some types of content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135595/#Comment_135595" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T18:14:59+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  6:14PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somehow, now I'm envisioning a series of posts titled "How to Make Fruitful..."

If there is a secret, it has public consequences or it doesn't exist. An NPC is secretive or kills him/herself before the players could beat the secret out of him/her. The purpose of every secret is to be uncovered by the players. There is no such thing as a secret mechanism. If the GM thought out a good secret wich has no effect on the gameworld and can't be uncovered, than it doesn't exist for the players. Everything has the purpose of getting known by the players. If not directly, then indirectly. This latter I call hidden functions, where you realize afterwards what was or could be the purpose of some things wich seemingly didn't have any importance. But that's also has the purpose of impacting the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
