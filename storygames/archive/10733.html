It's <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/VGG Vision.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and I post it to S-G because there are lots of community builders here, and people who are part of or interested in forming gaming organizatoins. Please! Read it, comment, discuss.<br/><br/>I'm really excited about the direction we're going. I learned a lot, as president and facilitator, about our direction and our history. Neat-o.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238090/#Comment_238090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T22:03:00+00:00" title="October 18, 2009 10:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, Joepub.  It's great to see someone injecting some energy and giving some direction to the VGG.  You guys out there in the west coast have always held a warm spot in my heart and I think there is a core of a good, solid gaming community in the history and structure of the VGG.  But it seemed to be suffering from two of the classic problems, lack of active, dedicated leadership and lack of capable manpower.  With this document and some of the activity I've been seeing on the forums, it seems like you are already starting off on the right foot with the former.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the document itself, I think it's really solid.  It's good to have a formalized structure, but I hope you won't let formalization take up too much resources from actually doing stuff.  Ultimately, in my experience, most local community-building efforts break down on the operational level.  So I guess I'm saying, get the mission statement and guidelines locked down, so you have a solid foundation, but then move forward on dedicating all your resources on completing specific tasks.  The last pages of the document are a good start in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting up a volunteer coordinator is a good idea.  We have never prioritized that here in Montreal with Draconis, but we did it at my workplace.  It has really born fruit, but it's a hard job keeping volunteers connected, requiring constant inputs of communication and incentive by the coordinator.  It's doable but make sure you coordinate the challenge to whoever is going to take that on.  It's not the same as doing publicity or administrative stuff.  You've got to be constantly pushing buttons, keeping things moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be really interested to hear how it goes moving forward.  I am particularly interested in how effective you find the document to be as something that keeps everyone more or less united and progressing forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally great stuff overall.  Good luck with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other note, and this is total supposition.  In general, you seem to be a pretty productive person, but I warn you against burn out.  Early enthusiasm when you start a project like this can be high and you may have a ton of energy (when you said "I told the participants that I'd have a formal report ready within about two weeks, but five hours later I'm done" is what made me think of this), but over time, as difficulties and inertia set in, it can be difficult to find that enthusiasm if you've gone too hard at the beginning.  This may be your normal mode, so I could be way off-base.  Just keep on eye on pacing yourself for the long haul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238091/#Comment_238091" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T22:09:26+00:00" title="October 18, 2009 10:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>One other note, and this is total supposition.

Part of the reason I'm wanting to establish a Volunteer Coordinator and a GM Coordinator for the organization is so that I don't burn myself out, promoting my cause in a vacuum.<br><br>Still, though: very good advice, and thanks for checking me on that. I tend to have energy ebbs/flows, and part of this planning is enabling the society to function when any individual members are ebbing/burning out/busy/moving/adopting cats/buying houses/having kids.<br><br>Really, writing that report tonight was a joy, whereas writing it next week might have been a labor.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238121/#Comment_238121" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T06:32:15+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  6:32AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great to hear.  And again, your priority of finding specific people to take on major roles is a huge step. This was not done aggressively (though we passively accepted anyone who stepped up and volunteered) with Draconis and it has hurt us, in my opinion.  You need motivated people who are given the authority to take on the responsibility and keep things moving forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
