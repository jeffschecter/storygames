Is there some media that we can watch together that will help people get a handle on the setting?<br/><br/>We discuss the <i>characters as a group</i> -- what do the PCs do together?<br/><br/>We discuss the characters' backgrounds -- how do the PCs know each other, what shared experiences do they have, what shared ideals do they have, what fertile ground is there for in-character disputes or reminiscences or relationships?  Are there any toxic relationships between PCs that need to be ironed out before the game starts (a PC who is mortally afraid of all things reptile in a group with two reptile-people, etc.)?<br/><br/>We discuss the characters' mechanics -- does every PC have a spotlight?  Do PCs that share a spotlight share it well?  Does anyone have a spotlight that will never, ever come up (i.e., the ace pilot in a game where no one will ever see an airplane)?<br/><br/>We sometimes do things like "describe the enemy of the PC of the player to your left" or "what was the worst job the PC to your right ever had?"<br/><br/>We pass around our usually-limited set of books and players who have made characters before (or who are just faster at it than others) help out new players/slower players.<br/><br/>We typically have a GM, so when everything is said and done, the GM (who also participates in the entire process, of course) gets to take some notes on the PCs and let that inform his prep for the first actual play session next week.<br/><br/><br/>Any one or two of those things would be worth a Saturday before starting the game just by themselves.

So you're already gonna spend a couple hours makin' your dude.<br/><br/>If everyone does this together, it makes for lots of useful feedback that will result in a better game ("Wait, so that shadowy organization that's chasing your guy?

If so, I'll make my rogue more of a sword guy." ... and so on).<br/><br/>Without a specific character creation session, you don't get that kind of thing.

Our group is playing it for the first time, and we've only done the character-creation session so far, but it was a blast.<br/><br/>I generally find this to be the case with most games, though.  Also, our group is very social, and I like hanging out with them anyway, so character creation is just another fun thing to do.  We have, sometimes, done character concepts together and then done some of the fiddly, mechanical bits later as homework.  Character creation tends to have a lot of t-crossing and i-dotting in some systems, and that can be a not-so-great group activity.  We are also one of those groups that plays for 2-3 hours, rather than 5-6 hours, so creation fills up a whole session for us fairly easily.<br/><br/>Another advantage I just thought of: whatever game we're playing, we usually have about three copies of the rules between five to seven players, so it almost makes group sessions mandatory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240493/#Comment_240493" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T14:07:15+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  2:07PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think judd is misremembering some of our SotC sessions.

If it is dry, you are all going to meet in a bar (oh, Call of Chtlhu, you all meet in an insane asylum....which is already a much more interesting situation than the trite bar cliche) and lets just fill in the character sheets... that isn't much fun.  <br/><br/>But CoC isn't a particularly complicated Chargen.  You should probably be able to all get on the same page and still find a couple of hours to actually launch the game.  Here is where expressing your enthusiasm can really work.  Especially if the players come to the GM with PCs loaded with plot hooks... that way she/he doesn't have as much work to do in terms of coming up with something right on the spot.

I'm reading the various posts thinking "Man, I'm glad I'm not at that session". No offence, you understand.<br/><br/>I'm wary when games (such as Diaspora) or people (such as Mike) suggest that character creation sessions are generally good. I mean, I understand it works for their group, and that's cool. But I don't assume our group's stuff will work for everybody else. I don't write games that say "You must have a meal in the middle of your game! It will make your game better!".<br/><br/>It may be my improv training. Every time someone suggests you can work out relationships / background / etc, I think: why don't we just work it out in the game? It'll all change, anyway.<br/><br/>I like the idea of watching Raging Bull. I'd happily do that. I do also enjoy world creation, much more than character creation, and I can imagine a preliminary session of Ganakagok or Sign In Stranger. <br/><br/>And, oh, man, the idea that we could socialise or play Guitar Hero, instead of roleplaying, is anathema to me. I mean, we'd agreed to roleplay. It's like turning up, in full football kit, ready to play, only for someone to say "Hey, shall we go to the pub instead? It's all social time, right?".

Ever?  Because I'd say that the majority of our group's character creation sessions are focused on "What do we do in this game?/What will this game be about?" questions and not so much on "How should I fill out this character sheet?"<br/><br/><br/>Edit: also, I think it's more along the lines of being told "Let's play football, but first we need to get together and discuss the league rules and our game schedule, and also decide what the team colors should be and things like that.  If we have time left, we can hang out as friends, since our first actual game will be next week."  If you showed up in full football kit for <i>that</i>, you'd be a loon.

That's almost exactly the conversation I had with my wife after I came back from our Mouse Guard session zero.<br/><br/>I'm a proponent of it because it gets us on the same page, and it's a valuable brainstorming session. Particularly with a new group of people, or those who are relatively new to each other, it's good to hang out and chat while doing the chargen. For a oneshot, of course I don't do this. I go with pregens or we're playing a game like The Mountain Witch or 3:16 or something that has quick chargen. But when I sit down for something I expect to go fairly long term, I consider this essential.<br/><br/>My Mouse Guard group is a good example. While I've played with everyone there, they have not all played with each other (though they have all met each other at various times). So for this group anyway, it's as much a "get to know you" session as it is something where we attend to the business of the game. I can tell you that we had a good time kicking ideas around, building certain things up, putting things together. We were playing, even if we weren't creating in-game fiction (we were making pre-game fiction, if you want to think of it that way).<br/><br/>I can understand Graham not liking it or getting it, but well, it works for me and it works well, and I hardly see it as a waste of time - I hung out with friends, we talked about the game and got ourselves on the same page creatively.

Generally I find that in such sessions, I spend half the time waiting for the rulebook (if there's only one) and the rest of the time waiting for other players to mull over the options presented to them. But I guess it comes from my own experiences; I've had many a chargen session in D&amp;D; 3.5 where we all had to have an awkward conversation about who's going to play the cleric, or about how we'd rather player X didn't play another elf with a rapier.

That's fine.  Everyone's different.<br/><br/>Having run the Diaspora Cluster/Character creation session twice in the last week for two different groups, I thought that I would share some of my thoughts on that. (I intend to put out a detailed write up of this soon, once I finish transcribing my notes.)<br/><br/>First of all, I hadn't originally intended to run the cluster creation, thinking I would just scale back to do something set in our solar system (albeit in the future).  But at the first creation session, one player was late, so we started it.<br/><br/>We made a 6-system cluster then, and everyone started swapping ideas.  The ideas for systems fed into the ideas for characters.  Very few players made characters from the systems they "owned."  Most interestingly, after they saw how the cluster was arranged, they decided that they would rather run a slipknot station (a la Babylon 5) and let the adventure come to them.  We had no idea starting out that they would get a station.  It just emerged from our cluster/character creation.<br/><br/>The second group was smaller (four players, counting myself), so we each made 2 systems, for a cluster of 8.  This time, the rolls greatly influenced us.  You never saw a cluster with so many barren, resource-lite worlds.  We quickly agreed that the who Cluster should get the "Used Up" aspect.  And our sole Tech+3 system, after we looked at the cluster as a whole, picked up the aspect "Screw You Guys, We're Outta Here."  They instantly became the bad guys of the Cluster, stealing resources from other systems to build a generational ark to leave the cluster for somewhere else.  And this became part of the backgrounds of each character.  In the end, we decided that a run in with these guys had left our characters' ship crashed on an ancient, ruined world filled with "Man-Eating Mutants."<br/><br/>So, I think Character/Setting creation sessions are a good place for emergent play... we wandered down a few dead ends, but in the end we had a good feel for what had happened in our characters' lives to that point.  Perhaps they're not for everyone, but at the same time, it can be a valuable resource for a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241287/#Comment_241287" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T12:55:25+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 12:55PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>People who do enjoy character creation sessions: what do you get out of them? Should I learn to enjoy them? Am I missing something?</blockquote>\nI find them to be a necessary evil in traditional games where the system does not allow for collaborative and player contribution. A group character creation session lets everyone talk about what sorts of characters, and thereby story, everyone wants and create characters that are already connected before the game starts.  Since these games also tend to require a couple of hours to fully make a character, this can be done as well. Although usually, I find that a couple of people actually make their character during the session. Most people go home and make their character after the group basics have been worked out.<br/><br/>Although really, you can do this online as long as there's someone to pester people who have trouble contributing. All it takes is a little bit of structure, talking about high level themes and drilling down into character specifics, making sure no one moves too fast so they don't have Sir Fred the Battlescarred and his Family History while another person is still debating the highest level details (or at least, make sure that they are okay with others moving ahead if they are having a hard time deciding).  Personally, I prefer the excuse to get together and socialize. Even if I'm not already friends with these people involved - no, especially if I'm not already friends with them - I want the chance to have a light evening where the game isn't happening to see how I might get along with them.  A character creation session is a wonderful space to be able to go "You know, this isn't going to work for me" without as much of the guilt that occurs with a game that's already underway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
