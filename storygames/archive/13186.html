Tim and Ron's characters knew each other's Day Faces, but my character didn't know theirs and they didn't know mine, so it was fictionally important to me to make that a "thing". Other than choosing a certain Trait at character creation, Day Face and Night Face don't have any mechanical weight in play, which I thought was fine given all the other mechanical widgets in the system.<br><br>As for the TPK, we basically smuggled ourselves into the catacombs (or whatever) beneath the citadel via crates that were being used to bring some kind of mysterious creatures. Turned out that the mysterious creatures were undead monsters, and after some kibbitzing and discovering that the ground was covered in the flesh and blood of the laborers who had opened the crates on the receiving end (ew), Ron's character tested on his Necromancer skill (with his Dead Speaker Trait) "to discover the things that are coming for us". Keith described these two Soldiers of the Damned, and we went to a conflict (technically a Fight, I think, but we were playing pretty loose with skills). The goal of the Soldiers of the Damned was to kill us all, and our goal was to neutralize them as a threat in some way (Ron wanted to destroy them, Tim and I pretty much just wanted to evade them). We both started with Disposition of 6, IIRC.<br/><br/>Basically, Keith was rolling well and none of us were scripting Defense actions, so our Disposition went down pretty quick. I think they had Dis 3 and we had Dis 1, and Ron and Keith both scripted Attacks, and Keith rolled two or three successes and Ron rolled 2 successes. So, we were at 0 and they were at 1, which would have been a Major Compromise in their favor, but then either Tim or I pointed out that Ron could take a Doom die to add an automatic success. He did, be both went down to 0, which (after consulted the Mouse Guard book) meant that we both get our goal! <br/><br/>Things that would have avoided this outcome: Ron not taking the Doom die (I think, I'm pretty sure Keith would have used the Major Compromise to maybe only kill 1 of us, or give us some hefty conditions, etc); us coordinating our scripting (like I said, no Defense rolls = no good), us having higher relevant skills (which is a separate issue)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299436/#Comment_299436" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T08:01:51+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  8:01AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting that in this case, being more successful cost you guys everything.

Remember also that none of us knew what would happen if we both hit Disp 0 (Keith had never seen it happen before himself, I think he said, and he's played a lot of Burning stuff). I see the logic behind the rule (if you get your opponent to Disp 0, you get what you want, so if you both do it you both get what you want), but fictionally it's pretty damn wierd. Maybe it should be more like neither of you get what you want? I don't have the answer.<br/><br/>Tyler, I don't have the original rules text in front of me, but as we experienced it, each side has a goal they're trying to achieve, and the idea is you'll probably end up making a compromise that's somewhere between the two goals. In the cases of one side reduces the other to Disp 0 <i>without having their Disp reduced</i>, then they get the original goal as written. So, in 99% of cases, the winning side will get what they want on some spectrum of original goal -&gt; minor compromise -&gt; major compromise, so I don't know if there's a rule-based "objectives should not be exclusive" or what. In our game, most objectives were generally opposed (like "I get him to tell me what he's smuggling vs. "He tells you nothing and throws you out on your ear", stuff like that). I guess you could have objectives that are more orthagonal (like "I get him to tell me what he's smuggling" vs. "He steals your wallet, reducing your Resources to 0" or something like that), if it makes sense in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299472/#Comment_299472" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T10:42:33+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 10:42AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler,<br/><br/>As I see it, you could not have mutually exclusive goals in a conflict, because if the goals don't conflict, you are not in a conflict. A conflict requires two opposing goals, even if they are not head to head goals, like in this case, I wanted to kill them, they just wanted to remove me as a threat.
