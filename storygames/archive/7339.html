This year I played no scheduled events. <br/><br/>All I did was play demos at the exhibit hall, pick up games at Games on Demand, and hung out till 2-3am every night at the Embassy Suites. It freed me up to socialize. I didn't get to hang out with everyone I wanted to (Jason being one prominent example) but I did meet many new people, saw friends I only see once a year, and had many non-small talk, deep conversations. The social aspect of gaming is huge for me. The social part fuels me. And it was sweet, nutritional, and filling! <br/><br/>The one low of the con for me eventually turned into a high! My contributions to the marketing seminar were a mixed bag. There were a few technical problems, miscommunication, and I became nervous at the last second and was too shaky and talked too fast. I thought it was terrible. <br/><br/>But almost every single person at the seminar who I didn't know gave me their card, signed up for my mailing list for more info, and a few people offered to buy me drinks later on to pick my brain! <br/><br/>So overall it turned out ok. I need to fix my delivery but the content was good.<br/><br/>Terry had a wonderful time which always makes me happy!<br/><br/>A few of us ate at a fancy steak house late Sunday night which was a pleasure.<br/><br/>Jared bought me a Teifling mini for our 4E game! And then upon purchasing a new set of dice, rolled a natural 20 on his first roll! His enthusiasm when "talking about his character" at the game design seminar was very cute! <br/><br/>I just got to spend a tremendous of quality time with many people. Ralph especially!<br/><br/>And on our way home from Gencon, Terry and I made a few new friends while waiting for our plane at the airport. Which is always a plus.<br/><br/>And the red panda...

I personally sold at least 8-12 copies by ranting about the game to people. It's so easy to pitch. It's starship troopers where you don't roll to see how much damage you do. You roll to see how many aliens you kill! Also, it was an easy game to play through an entire reward cycle in 1-2 hours. Coupled with the fact that someone gave out dozens of printed character sheets to play with, it was very easy to play and see for yourself if you were interested in buying. And failure is fun. So if you have no idea what you are doing, it's still enjoyable. Gregor is also very sexy and charismatic. So all the pieces fell together. I did have issues with stunting and getting them to be effective but I haven't fully read the book yet. So it could have just been the convention first release, In a Wicked Age effect where the book looks small so everyone reads it quickly, assumes quite a bit about the rules, and rules drift quickly creeks in. So I definitely wouldn't consider this a review of the game. Just super quick first impressions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163028/#Comment_163028" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T13:06:17+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  1:06PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also got closer to proving my Vincent / Graham = Spike before vampirism / Spike after vampirism theory.

Willow Palecek's FATE hack <i>Awesome Adventures,</i> which is ... wait for it ...<br/><br/>Not so surprising:<br/><br/>4.  <i>Thou Art But A Warrior</i> turned out great, with some lovely full color plates and very elegant add-on mechanics.<br/>5.  <i>It's Complicated</i>, which my (apparently soon-to-be-a-gamer) wife immediately grabbed and pored over with intense interest.<br/>6.  <i>3:16</i>, you maggots!  Now stand up and hook up!<br/><br/>I also scored a copy of the Solmukohta 2008 collection <i>Playground Worlds</i>, which I will treasure.<br/><br/>That's just my personal taste, but there were about six booths stuffed with creator owned amazing games and games-to-be,a nd each of those was stuffed with creators.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163041/#Comment_163041" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T13:43:13+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  1:43PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put together a huge post about it <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/maid-rpg-update-gencon-indy-2008/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>The short version is:<br/><br/>1. I got to meet lots of really cool people, including but not limited to: Jerry Grayson, Luke Crane (who finds the rough English translation of Meikyuu Kingdom hilarious), Elizabeth Shoemaker, Shreyas Sampat, Eero Tuovien, Adam Dray, Jason Morningstar, Paul Czege (who got me to buy The Fisherman's Wife in addition to Darkpages), and some others who I can't remember because names take a little while to stick in my head.<br/><br/>2.

I came home with a sizable stack of new games, and I played some awesome stuff too. My top 3:<br/><br/>1. Mist Robed Gate - this game had the dual pleasures of describing crazy wire-fu moves and veiled/passive aggressive speech. I started out playing a simple chef who, through play, became many things, including the crime lord of all of Chinatown - awesome!<br/><br/>2. Misery Bubblegum - I did not want to play this at all - "Anime cardgame" is a phrase that causes my eyes to instantly glaze over. But I had nothing else to do and my husband was interested, so I shuffled over to the table. It. Was. Fantastic. We only played for about an hour, but we packed it with sweet moments, surprising revelations, angst, cruelty, and other great stuff. Really fun - Tony must finish this!<br/><br/>3. Under My Skin as Jeepform - I'm still having difficultly talking about this. We had a great game with many very real moments, and I am grateful to the wonderful people I played this with. It was a pleasure to watch and a pleasure to play. Relationships were put to the test, and we had a happy ending, but it was one of the most quietly disturbing happy endings of any game I've played in. I am haunted. And I want to play it again.<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163095/#Comment_163095" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T17:16:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  5:16PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm psyched that Maid RPG did really well.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163099/#Comment_163099" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T17:32:16+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  5:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16 was the game everyone was playing.

Getting to meet my favorite artist, <a href="http://rebeccaguay.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rebecca Guay</a>, and totally being awestruck into a vague semblance of the English language.<br>3. Seeing friends from last year, and meeting new ones that I've only interacted with on this forum and others (you're all a lot taller than your avatars, go figure!).<br/>4. Being on two panels, and finding out they were actually good and informative to the audience.<br/>5. Starblazer Adventures. I now have a new superweapon!<br/>6. A 10-minute game of Zombie Cinema that made us laugh like nothing else (Ryan Macklin alluded to this game on one of the Sunday shows of This Just In... From Gen Con).<br/>7. The White Wolf Party. I got to connect with my goth roots again.<br/><br/>There's more, I know, and I'll remember later.

This year I played no scheduled events.<br/><br/>All I did was play demos at the exhibit hall, pick up games at Games on Demand, and hung out till 2-3am every night at the Embassy Suites. It freed me up to socialize. I didn't get to hang out with everyone I wanted to (Jason being one prominent example) but I did meet many new people, saw friends I only see once a year, and had many non-small talk, deep conversations. The social aspect of gaming is huge for me. The social part fuels me. And it was sweet, nutritional, and filling!<br/><br/>The one low of the con for me eventually turned into a high! My contributions to the marketing seminar were a mixed bag. There were a few technical problems, miscommunication, and I became nervous at the last second and was too shaky and talked too fast. I thought it was terrible.<br/><br/>But almost every single person at the seminar who I didn't know gave me their card, signed up for my mailing list for more info, and a few people offered to buy me drinks later on to pick my brain!<br/><br/>So overall it turned out ok. I need to fix my delivery but the content was good.<br/><br/>Terry had a wonderful time which always makes me happy!<br/><br/>A few of us ate at a fancy steak house late Sunday night which was a pleasure.<br/><br/>Jared bought me a Teifling mini for our 4E game! And then upon purchasing a new set of dice, rolled a natural 20 on his first roll! His enthusiasm when "talking about his character" at the game design seminar was very cute!<br/><br/>I just got to spend a tremendous of quality time with many people. Ralph especially!<br/><br/>And on our way home from Gencon, Terry and I made a few new friends while waiting for our plane at the airport. Which is always a plus.<br/><br/>And the red panda...

Highlights include:<br/><br/>*playing <i>A Flower for Mara</i> on Thursday night. I'll be writing up some AP when I get the chance. Deep, intense, powerful play. I felt a special connection with my fellow players during the rest of the con, and it wouldn't surprise me if it lasts longer than that.<br/><br/>*playing <i>Dirty Secrets</i> with Chris and Susie on Friday night. Because it was after-hours, I didn't feel like I had to have my designer hat on (like at IGE/GoD). Instead, I just got to hang out and play a game that I enjoy. Plus, I got my second dose of the corrupt college town of Bloomington, IN!<br/><br/>*talking game design until <i>way</i> too late with Eppy, Emily, Marc, and Matt.<br/><br/>*encountering <i>Zombie Cinema</i>.

I got to spend time socializing with friends, made new friends, and played my new favorite game -- 3:16 -- a whole lot (I even got to play with Trooper Dog!). I managed to sleep enough, too, except for Sunday night (Insomniac Award = Me).<br/><br/>Speaking of awards, congrats to Jason Morningstar for his Diana Jones victory! In your face, Child's Play!<br/><br/>It was wonderful to see all the small press booths buzzing with activity. Design Matters takes the prize for classy booth presentation.<br/><br/>I discovered how fun it is to say, "We are being attacked by chombies!" in a Finnish accent. Eero, Markku, and Juri were delightful and very fun to game with. I forgot to buy <i>Zombie Cinema</i> and now I am crying bitter tears.<br/><br/>I learned that Julia's ability to run an excellent demo is not impaired by alcohol. Also, <i>The Fisherman's Wife</i> is good, naughty fun.<br/><br/>It was great to finally meet Graham face to face, but I wish he wasn't so loud and rude. Maybe the next time he visits the states he will have learned his manners.<br/><br/>I had to give Ron a yellow card. But we hugged it out.<br/><br/>Matt Wilson and I sang Dr. Horrible lyrics at each other all weekend. He's writing a musical now (I think it should be called "Chombies!").<br/><br/>Vincent Baker will annoy the crap out of you with three foot tall Swamp People and then try to kill you with giant aquatic crows and he will laugh like the devil while he does it. <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> is shaping up into something special.<br/><br/>I never made it to the free breakfast at the Embassy, but I did show up for the free booze thing in the evenings.

Call it a sneaking suspicion, but I think he's on to a winner.<br/><br/>Having some great people at the games of Mob Justice, Cold City and Hot War that I ran as part of the Indie Games Explosion.<br/><br/>Meeting Jeff Lowers wonderful wife Julie. Likewise for many other people I met for the first time in the flesh: Clint Krause and Amy Garcia (hopefully Empire of Dust will get some play soon), Elizabeth Shoemaker, Shreyas, and many others.<br/><br/>Major Restaurant! The best food in Indy! Wonderful Ethiopian delicacies, incredibly friendly service and great coffee (plus incense as an added bonus). And the company of Vincent Baker, Joshua A.C. Newman and Jim Pinto wasn't half bad either!<br/><br/>And, getting to stay in Western Mass for the week before Gen Con with my brilliant friend Joshua A.C. Newman and the always lovely Carrie.

I bought a lot of great games and got to see a lot of cool stuff, but getting to actually play these two games (with the authors) was what made the con.

I've owned the game for a little while and never had a chance to play it. On Friday, I finally got the chance and I wasn't disappointed. The characters we played had more depth in the single 15-minute scene than most RPG characters have in a full story.

I and thrilled that Jason is making this a yearly tradition and it makes for treasured memories.<br/><br/>So, the con for me kicked off in style with Jason getting the Diana Jones Award for Grey Ranks. The speech by Matt Forbeck used the word "narrativist" too. Great! Wolfgang Bauer's Open Design which shared the award also showed that non-conventional models of interaction with people who play your games is not only possible, but rewarding too.<br/><br/>On that note, the Design Matters booth was so much fun for me to be on and we didn't lose our jackets. Kevin and Nathan really led us from the front and Amy, Clint, Eppy, Shreyas and I were happy to follow them and have a good time. It was such a team effort and everyone was a perfect fit. Eppy coughing up a $100 dollar was hilarious and he kept the booth rocking. Nate, on a personal note, also helped me learn American by the end of the con...dum. Sweet Agatha is glorious and sold like hot cakes too, while Dread just hops into people's paws on its own. Though we do need an all-black Jenga set.<br/><br/>My friends Shannon and Paul were down from Seattle - so good to see them. They'll miss next year as they're getting married a week after the con in 09. They had a great time, which was really satisfying for me. The Grey Ranks demo they were in was fun (Shannon's character arguing with Jason playing her mother, and Paul's character going on a mission to brew up a tank) so they picked it up and will be playing it soon. Paul also really got his teeth into Black Cadillacs and some Axis &amp; Allies at the show.<br/><br/>John Harper was a huge reason that 3:16 sold so well. Thanks John! I awarded him a medal on the last day of the con for his efforts in combating bio-warfare (the least I could do). I think a lot of people had fun with it and it was very rewarding to see people just play it and find it's easy to do. You could see players getting savier with their choices as they played more and realised that there are (sometimes subtle) tactical choices in many facets of the game. (Hearing Brandon from Seattle talk about it was also fun, since he is trying his damndest to push and pull at the system.) Thanks also to John Snuffleupagus (ha!), Steve Segedy, Lance Allen et al. who talked to me about it. The cheap AT-43 minis were also ideal.<br/><br/>Also great to see so many UK guys there: Malcolm, Matt, Graham and me were there. Then Angus Abranson and the Cubicle 7 guys, as well as Pelgrane Press. So seeing Sacha Bilton, Marc Farrimond etc.<br/><br/>Going to the Ennies and seeing Flames Rising getting an Ennie Award was superb. Arneson cracking the room up with his humour was also delightful (...it's hard keeping a campaign fresh after 37 years, you know... he said to much laughter). Shame that Game Night didn't get an Ennie, but Jonny would have gone to pieces if he'd have to have given a speech, so it was for the best.<br/><br/>The Ashcan Front was a highlight for me again. Blood Red Sands is a gamey game and I'm keen to try it out. Kagematsu and Silence Keeps Me A Victim were my reading choices for the plane ride home.<br/><br/>The con ended on two high notes for me. One. Matt Wilson deservedly getting levelled up in 3:16 on a random roll-off. Adam's character Bronson went up on kills mainly owing to a grenade ambush that he rolled 20 for kills on, while Matt carved his way through most of the planet's Threat on his own. So when all the undeserving maggots rolled 8s and 9s, it was euphoric to see Matt roll a 10.<br/><br/>Two. Saying goodbye to everyone on the last night. Hugs all round, and the one I appreciated the most was from Clyde. It meant a lot to see Clyde with his book out as an ashcan and to hug him at con end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163568/#Comment_163568" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T06:26:39+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  6:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wandered the hall briefly with Graham and developed the Booth Babe Attraction-Repulsion Theory (BBART). Booth babes have a long range attractive force and a short range repulsive force in proportion to their looks and the scantiness of their costumes. I speculated that there are two approaches to using this phenomena to get people close to a booth. One would be to replace the booth babe with a less intitimidating one when the babes reach the Walmsley Horizon (where the attractive force equals the repulsive one), the other is to use two or three booth babes as sheep dogs to heard the punters to the stand. Graham volunteered to be a Pelgrane booth babe next year wearing only a pair of lime green Speedos with the Pelgrane Press logo on the front.<br/>\n<br/>\nSales-wise this was a decent year for ProFantasy, and our best for Pelgrane. The Mutant City Blues previews and Trail were flying off the shelves. Better sales means the usual con experience of long periods with little human contact were few and far between. Robin and Ken were a great draw to the Pelgrane stand as well as being a pleasure to talk to. Our new venture, Axe Iniative for 4e adventures got a great launch - we had a huge ProFantasy battlemat, and Sasha was DMing, using the Finger of Doom to point out characters in danger of death.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve ran some great Trail, Fear and Eso demos in half-hour slots, and this year I heard much less about "your books are a great read" and more about "we enjoy the game" and "how does this rule work"?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had fruitful talks with WotC about software and the GSL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discussed Fisherman's Friends with Julia and Graham, and played my one game of the con - Zombie Cinema with Eero and Graham. It was a good demo in that it showed what the game was about and we enjoyed it. I didn't get much IPR chat in - Fred was horribly busy, and once again didn't see the mighty Vincent. I at least spoke to Luke, Emily and Elizabeth, and grabbed some ashcans. I'm a disappointingly easy sell.  Generally, though, the only way I get to talk to people is to see them at the booth.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and we got two ENnies, hooray!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

She's giving us her sizes so we can get her a shrine maiden outfit next year.<br/>* She fucking *plays*. Big time RPGer (currently stranded in bumblefuck Indiana, mind), also does CCGs IIRC. She played in my Tenra Bansho game on Friday as the inscrutable Shinto priestess/ayakashi demon crossbreed, and really brought some game to the table. It was awesome.<br/>* She also works at a video game store, and spent a majority of the con trying to convince me not to buy a PS3 so that I could get an XBox, to join them all on their weekly Saturday Night online games of Bomberman and Halo. I think she even put me in a headlock for emphasis. That's how passionate she is about games.<br/><br/>And yeah, her enthusiasm was contagious. Sure, there were some leering types (Ex: when she went out for a smoke in her gear, some creepy guy started talking her up about furry outfits, etc), but for the most part she dug the attention, drew more attention to the game, and in general was having fun on her own terms.

I am interested in the sales curve from different gen con and sale years, and I was rather surprised when (after the enthusiastic threads about it after Gen Con 2006) there was almost no mention of total sales (at least in public forums) after Gen Con 2007 (I sort of assumed it was because the fragmentation led to lower sales than expected,  and to a sort of a backlash started in 2007 against these threads too). What it's your impression about the differences about this from 2006, 2007 and 2008? How were sales last year? What do you think are the causes of the higher sales this year? Better games? Better presentation? Better publicity? The booth position? You are better as salesmen this year?

But at the con itself, only 1 ticket-holder showed. But there were like 7 people loitering around that wanted a seat. I'm happy to say that we managed to fit them all in, and everyone brought their A-game. Seriously, every time I run this game it gets better and better, because of what the players bring to the table.<br/><br/>Another highlight was finally putting a face to the name of the hardcore anime gamer Seizui (Danny). Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you choose the moniker "Holy Water?" (Sei and Zui?)<br/><br/>Danny is off the hook, and I'll talk more about him in a new topic, because he does something I haven't seen much before: He has concepts for anime-themed characters, and writes backgrounds for them. Then, he finds an RPG (Tenra, Anima, Alshard, 7 Fortress, whatever) and tries to conceptualize the character in that system. Then, and this is the majestic part, he commissions VERY high quality anime art from solid artists for his characters. It's like spending some serious dough not on "roleplaying books", but on "play/concept materials". That's goddamned hot.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/ziggurat/SKzz1aVOuKI/AAAAAAAABYg/T_C84iQJwEg/GenCon2008%20060.jpg?imgmax=640"/><br/><br/>Another highlight: Selling out of the MAID RPG.

Luckily, I never got completely sick, despite being in a virus hibernation chamber (the dealer's hall and the bathrooms there), but I never felt completely awesome either.<br/><br/>* When I got back from the con, I booted up my PC to find that it wouldn't boot, not even in safe mode. Luckily, I didn't lose any data at all because I back up like a madman. But I did have to reinstall the OS. Which was probably a good thing, because now the machine is sleek and mean again:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ziggurat/SKz26z5BG6I/AAAAAAAABbA/BISppOrf7X8/GenCon2008%20098.jpg?imgmax=640"/><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163997/#Comment_163997" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T07:59:25+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:59AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>events on Wednesday</blockquote>I didn't even know there WAS official gaming events on Wednesday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163999/#Comment_163999" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T08:00:07+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  8:00AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite><em>My Mother the Bolo</em>, in which an orphan is raised by cybernetic tanks.</blockquote>Are you messing with me?

Two Gencons and still not one person has been less than friendly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2)The games!  Last year I spent much too much time walking around doing nothing in particular.  This year I got to play all sorts of cool games, Vegas After Midnight, Mecha, Mythender, Seiyuu (don't think I spelled that one correctly,) and Swashbucklers of the Seven skies.  Lots of games, all unique.  The creativity startles me sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3) Getting to run Vegas After Midnight after the podcast meet-and-greet.  I don't know what it is about that game, but I just get it.  Note: Running a playtest of someone's game with one of the creator's watching is a little nerve-wracking, especially when the creator is also a friend.  <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Watching Lenny Balsera and Ryan Macklin talk.  It's 4am Sunday after Matt Gandy's Seiyuu (I'll go with it until corrected,) playtest and Lenny convinced me to drink yet more alcohol.  We're sitting there, chilling and Macklin shows and they just start chatting.  Ass-early, sleep deprived, 4-5 days straight of nothing but gaming and they still have such a passion for games.  <br/>\n<br/>\n5) New books, more than I should've bought, but I don't regret buying a one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7339/gencon-2008-how-was-the-show/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7339/gencon-2008-how-was-the-show">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7339/gencon-2008-how-was-the-show/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7339/gencon-2008-how-was-the-show/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7339%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7339%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
