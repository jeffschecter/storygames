It might yet be possible to save them. He has a lead on information, but it is an address in Habagaria.<br/><br/>Colonel Nathan, an Eagle Commando, recently watched his unit suffer terrible losses at the hand of a mad alchemist in Camport. It was only the action of a group of alchemists (including Edmund) that the madman was stopped. Nathan is told to take three of his trusted lieutenants with him and follow Edmund, who is already a wanted man following an incident at the Central gaol.<br/><br/>A Hermetic Alchemist, who keeps his name a secret, is celebrating coming into an inheritance after using the chaos at Camport to poison his brother. His investigations of the mad alchemist's workshop have alerted him to the existence of an important book called the 'Logos of Krull'. However, he learns that important documents were in the hands of his brother's lawyer in Habgaria, so a journey is in order if he is to enjoy the fruits of his fratricide.<br/><br/><br/>Trouble strikes for Edmund at the border crossing- he is unmasked as a transgressive alchemist and only escapes into Habgaria by his wits and alchemy. Nathan, observing at a discreet distance, chooses to observe rather than intervene. Both of them purchase tickets for the train travelling to Northern Habgaria.<br/><br/>The Hermite cannot afford such luxurious passage. Neither can he afford to buy a quality horse, so instead has to make do with a 'feagued old screw'. On the road he is approached by a party of soldiers, who warn him that politically-motivated bandits have been seen in the area. Sure enough, later he narrowly avoids being seen by two of them. He follows them to where they have set up camp, and learns that they intend to attack the train that evening. He waits in the shadows until most of them leave, then ambushes the one who remains behind. After freezing him solid, the Hermite takes his horse and continues his journey.<br/><br/>Nathan confronts Edmund in the dining car, with his lieutenants as back-up. Edmund persuades the soldier that his mission is noble, more or less. Nathan, images of the massacre of his men in his mind, agrees to accompany Edmund to his destination. He will defer judgement, at least for the time being. As this entente is reached, the train shudders to a stand-still, covering Nathan in lobster bisque. Seeing that logs have been thrown across the tracks, the two of them suspect an imminent attack. Edmund prepares some alchemical gyres on the windows of the carriage. Nathan takes his men to the guard's van, and sees men on horseback approaching. He tries to get all of the passengers into the dining car, to keep them safe, leaves two of his men there, and returns to Edmund to fill him in. Edmund leaves the train and prepares a circle around the carriage behind the dining car.<br/><br/>Nathan hurries back to the guard's van, only to see that the guard is holding his men at gunpoint after the bandits have swarmed onto the train. When they bandits reach the dining car, Edmund tries to drop the previous carriage into a hole using alchemy, but someone foils his attempt by creating a rocky pillar to support it. Gunfire breaks out in the dining car. Nathan overpowers the guard and runs back to help. A grandly-dressed woman and a teen-age girl are being held at gunpoint by the conductor. "Don't you know who I am?" the girl haughtily declares. Despite their best efforts, the conductor flees with the girl. Two of the bandits are trapped in a hole by Edmund, for the authorities to question. The rest are allowed to leave peaceably, as long as they do so with no further violence. The theory that one of the bandits is an alchemist is borne out by the way that one of Nathan's lieutenants was incapacitated by someone extruding a metal beating stick from the train.<br/><br/>Edmund and Nathan continue to their destination on foot, aware that their presence might not be exactly welcomed by the Habgarian authorities.<br/><br/>Some time later, the Hermite arrives at the lawyer's estate. The lawyer is a Habgarian noble and, it turns out, an alchemist. The lawyer is welcoming, inviting the Hermite to stay the night and peruse the library. The Hermite discovers a copy of the Logos of Krull, and sneaks it into his bag. The book is written in Mallinese, and is clearly alchemical in nature- a contradiction that is intriguing. The lawyer leaves for the afternoon for business over the border in Mallinet.<br/><br/>Much later, Edmund and Nathan arrive at the address Edmund had. The girl from the train opens the door, then swears and slams it in their faces. Edmund uses alchemy to make a hole in the wall. The conductor is in the room, pointing a gun at the intruders. Nathan talks the two of them down and the truth comes out- the girl is the daughter of Archduke Gantt, and an active organiser of the militant group. The entire train heist was her idea, hitting a soft target to secure funds. She is, herself, an alchemist, taught by a distant relative. He used to live at the cottage until he inherited the estate from his father, and he now lives at the big house. The girl had chosen the cottage as a place to lie low as she had a key to it and was unlikely to be disturbed there.<br/><br/>Edmund and Nathan traipse over to the mansion, and encounter the Hermite there. The paranoid Hermite is convinced they have been following him all the way from Camport, and the situation nearly spirals out of hand until they realise that the information Edmund is seeking could well be in the book the Hermite has taken. None of them can translate the Mallinese. The butler informs them over dinner that the master is late returning from his errands. With some questioning, it is revealed that the lawyer is fluent in Mallinese, and did indeed teach some alchemy to the Archduke's daughter. Nathan and Edmund head back to the cottage with the Logos of Krull, hoping that she can help translate it.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the master of the house returns. He is wounded. He was denounced as an alchemist over the border in Mallinet and barely escaped with his life. A lynch mob has followed him across the border and is heading towards the estate. The Hermite had discovered earlier that the flower beds around the house were an alchemical gyre, and takes the opportunity to fortify the wood alchemy with some ice alchemy of his own. When the mob appears, the alchemists raise a wall of thorns and ice around the mansion, buying them time. Over a hundred angry Mallinese zealots starts hacking their way through it. Fire pots are thrown through the windows of the house, keeping the Hermite busy dousing the flames. The butler helps with some left-over lobster bisque.<br/><br/>Edmund asks for help from the daughter. She can read some of it, but there is not enough information in the book about the key issue- whether the people trapped in the gyre beneath Camport can be saved. The book does say that its contents are a partial transcription of engravings in the Temple of the Weeping Maiden, wherever that might be, and implies that more information might be there. When Edmund and Nathan return to the house, they see the mob clustering around it. Edmund creates and underground tunnel for them to enter without being seen, and collapses it after them. Nathan and his lieutenants opens fire on the mob, driving it back until the Habgarian cavalry arrives to save them all.<br/><br/>At the end of the session, important information has been discovered- but it looks like Edmund will have to travel deep into Mallinet to find out more- just after a very graphic demonstration of the Mallinese attitude towards alchemy.<br/><br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining three hours. The most memorable quote was the recurring 'Covered in bisque!', which only makes any sense if you like Eddie Izzard.<br/><br/>(Balls, this was meant to be in actual play vignettes. Can someone help?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
