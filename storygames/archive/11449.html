What would you do in that game?  Like, if it was a pirate vessel, how many ships can you raid before it gets boring?  I can think of shows like Star Trek and movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, but most of what goes on has nothing to do with manning a vessel. <br/><br/>The reason I ask is people always become interested in these sorts of campaigns.  I've played in pirate games, spacecraft games, games with airships... and at the end of it all, there aren't really any conflicts that are on a "ship" scale.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254936/#Comment_254936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T22:32:55+00:00" title="February  3, 2010 10:32PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 11:59PM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

It's not often that such games enter a "moral space" or demand "tough choices"--which is a large chunk of what role-playing (i.e. acting, immersion) gets at.

The gunner can attempt to fire a counter missile or he can try and pummel their ship some more. The engineer can either route more power to the shields or to the weapons.  Ideally each player controls something that as a whole, controls the ship.  Like Voltron.<br/><br/>There's more conflicts I can think of that address the entire ship.

Doing something that fantastical would take away the onus of credibility, which would pretty quickly raise its head if you wanted to depict a crew of even a quasi-real ship as any sort of independent actors making decisions against a common enemy. Because if that were your game and I were playing the torpedo guy, do you know, I don't think I'd make one decision during a battle myself - I'd just do what the captain told me to, and perhaps rolled the dice a couple of times when you told me to. It's not smart to start improvising when you're part of a trained machine of war like that.<br/><br/>But Voltron, there you have plenty of fantasy room to make real individual cooperation towards a common goal. You can set up the technology of the miracle machine any which way happens to support your idea. Perhaps the power source guy has to make split-second decisions about who to give power to, while the others are constantly screaming at him to give them more power? A stupid way to structure a giant robot to be sure, but it's fantasy, so it's OK.<br/><br/>Yes... at the beginning of a combat round the arms guys (one or two, depends on how many players you have) get to choose which weapons to use on which targets or if the arms do something else than attack, while the legs guy (only one, as you can't make important tactical choices with just one leg) gets to choose where we're going... the power source guy gets to distribute power (dice, whatever) to the others, thus determining their chances of success. The head guy gets extra data he has to vet and distribute to the others (like, the GM gives him half a dozen pieces of paper per round with external communications, details scanned by the Voltron, internal data and such, but he only gets to give one to each of the other players); the head guy also talks to the outside world in the giant robot's stead. All this is assumed to happen so quickly that no command chain is considered possible, everybody just has to go go go go! before the space alien lands and crushes the White House. In practice I'd probably set it up with players being able to talk to each other freely, but they only have a minute to make their moves for the round - their choice whether to get paralyzed or get something done. After the fight the Voltron crew gets to have a thorough post-mission row as they all realize they hate each other. During the third session the whole Voltron gets sucked through a spacetime rift into a space carnival where everybody is 100m high (just like Voltron) and they need to take care of repairs and social interaction in their giant robot form to ever get home.<br/><br/>Yes, I could see a game in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255186/#Comment_255186" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T07:40:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  7:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>In my imaginary game, each player has an important station aboard the ship.

Like Voltron.</blockquote>\nAs noted above, <i>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</i> is <b>exactly</b> like this, inspired by the old FASA <i>Star Trek</i> RPG<br/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255268/#Comment_255268" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T17:28:13+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  5:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>Like Voltron.</blockquote>\nSold!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255281/#Comment_255281" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T21:49:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  9:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about the ship combat rules in Diaspora.

If I remember right, there were three variants in the rules -- the first was a wargaming-type system, meant more for mass battles, which used a hex map and didn't involve any character stats.  The second was a modification of that system, where characters could make skill rolls to temporarily "bump up" ship stats.  <br/><br/>The third was the system droog is talking about, where each player had a different sheet, and different responsibilities.  I remember that the weapons officer assigned weapons to targets and made the firing rolls; the engineer assigned energy to different systems and also had points to assign that represented repair crews, to try to bring damaged systems back up to full; the science officer was in charge of the scanners; the helmsman was in charge of movement, and so on.  As in the second system, players could use their characters' skill in various ways to try to "get more out of" the ship.<br/><br/>I believe the captain didn't have a sheet at all -- his responsibility was simply to listen to the situation and give orders to the other players, who would then use their judgement in exactly how to carry out those orders.<br/><br/>We played two combats that way over the course of the six months or so I ran Star Trek, if I remember right, and it worked out fairly well.  I'll dig it out tonight and see if I can give some more detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255915/#Comment_255915" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T08:10:15+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  8:10AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Voltron would actually be a really smart direction for you. Doing something that fantastical would take away the onus of credibility, which would pretty quickly raise its head if you wanted to depict a crew of even a quasi-real ship as any sort of independent actors making decisions against a common enemy. Because if that were your game and I were playing the torpedo guy, do you know, I don't think I'd make one decision during a battle myself - I'd just do what the captain told me to, and perhaps rolled the dice a couple of times when you told me to. It's not smart to start improvising when you're part of a trained machine of war like that.</blockquote>\nWell, I'd missed the thread before...<br/><br/>What about not having a played captain at all? As in, no one (including the GM) controls the captain. It is sort of retconned that any decision made by the players is attributed to him automatically. So, that torpedo guy's player decides what and when to fire, and in fiction the captain ordered the guy to do so.<br/><br/>And that works mechanically as Eero said about the voltron stuff (only you mustn't be playing a big pieced robot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255929/#Comment_255929" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T08:44:49+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  8:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you have against playing a big multi-part robot, Damian?

I am not sure how granular you want your rule set. The example in Burning Wheel is as follows:<br/><br/><i>"The characters are sneaking a ship out of a harbor and sailing through pirate-infested waters to a remote island. The GM determines that this stated intent is going to require three tests: The Orc pirate must pass a Piloting test, the Priest Navigator must then pass a Navigation test and the Temple Guardian will test his observation as he watches for pirates. In this case the Orc pirate-player barely meets his obstacle. This doesn't affect the Navigator, who fails anyway. Luckily, the aged Temple Guardian passes his test, despite the increased obstacles. <br/><br/>The final result is that this ship finds it's way to the island (success) but approaches from the wrong angle (failure) - she's spotted by pirates in the bay at the same time she spots them (success). The chase is on!!!"</i><br/><br/>So each player has something to contribute towards the overall intent. This same approach works for ship to ship combat as well. Hope this helps.<br/><br/>Ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue" title="Greentongue"><img alt="Greentongue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue">Greentongue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256220/#Comment_256220" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T16:42:42+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  4:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about something like Firefly in the Verse?
