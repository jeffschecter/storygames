But I thought this combination of random rules and doing your own thing would suit my kids, and I think I was mostly right. We used pencils and crayons to do our drawings. I thought about getting out the tracing paper, but I thought it would add too much complexity and confusion for them, so we are doing these on one sheet of paper each. I cut the Age of Civilization a little short just so we didn't completely fill the map, and to stave off kids' boredom through repetition.<br/><br/>I told them that the only way to do something wrong or to "mess up" was to stop having fun. I think Mr. 7 had a moment or two like that, but in general we didn't worry about doing things right, we worried about having fun and making cool maps.<br/><br/><br/>THE PRIMORDIAL AGE<br/><br/>We rolled these separately. My primordial age was fairly sedate with mithrail deposits, a gold vein and three caverns with primordial beasts. Mr. 7 had a magma cave, the primoridal beast caverns, and an ancient wyrm (which I forgot to have him name).<br/><br/>Mr. 4 had a deep underground river, a vein of gold and I think the primordial beasts, too. He also drew a few green shapes that I think were supposed to be cities or other inhabited areas, along with another cave in a place where he thought he could use a monster. He also added a purple line snaking across the map--I forget what that signifies.<br/><br/>THE AGE OF CIVILIZATION<br/><br/>To simplify things, we made one roll for all of us, ending up with the Demon Civilization (I'm sure that's what they would have picked if they had the choice). We drew our large demon pits and filled them with 10 pennies (our dark beads).<br/><br/>From there, the demons' tunnel worm went to work on each of our maps. On my map, he hit the gold vein on the first year, resulting in a Gateway Stone and a bound demon. Two years later the tunnel worm found the primordial beasts, slupring up one per year. Looking back at the rules now, I'm not sure if those should have become Demon Palaces or Charnel Shrines, but I made them Charnel Shrines at the time. <br/><br/>The boys played this part pretty loose. Mr. 7's worm made a labyrinth of tunnels all over the right side of his map, eventually making tunnels in the air (which seems like a neat trick). I think at one point the worm discovered a dragon and was devoured, but soon replaced by another worm, apparently FedExed from the demon dimension.<br/><br/>Mr. 4 moved his nickel (the token we were using for the worm) around somewhat at random, drawing a single line for the tunnel. The worm did manage to eat someone along the way, and I think uncover a water-filled room?<br/><br/>After about five or six years of demon civilization, I turned my worm toward the surface and precipitated the war with heaven. We all cleared out our demon pits, and got ready for the Great Disaster.<br/><br/>THE GREAT DISASTER<br/><br/>There's really no going wrong with the Great Disaster. All the options are equally messed up. We rolled for The Fallen Star and added the resultant crater to our maps. <br/><br/>THE AGE OF MONSTERS<br/><br/>We went through the setup stage of the Age of Monsters. My surface Kingdom castle, near the Fallen Star crater, is named Starwatch. Mr. 7's is something like "Lair of the Wraith." True to form, Mr. 4 wanted to call his "Lair of the Wraith," too, but I think he ended up with something like "The Mind Flayer's Kingdom."<br/><br/>For Delving Groups, I think we rolled "Fungaliths," but none of us knew what that meant. I went with Dark Elves. Mr. 7 was excited to see there was a "make up your own" option, and decided that Delving Beholders were the thing. I think Mr. 4 missed the memo. My map will star the Outsiders as the Breeding Group, complete with planar warp. Mr. 4 setup the goblins, while I believe Mr. 7 is going with kobolds. For Alpha Predators, I drew the sphinx and the boys both went with purple worms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233264/#Comment_233264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T07:42:50+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  7:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really awesome!
