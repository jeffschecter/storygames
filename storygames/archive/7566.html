So well, we're actually following it up with another Nobilis campaign. Now, I'd never gamed with either of these women before and it seemed like they were used to tyrannical GMs. Apparently he would come to the table with backstories written for them. I am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. It actually took them awhile to get used to me, and early on there were a lot of interactions like this:<br/><br/>"So, what is my character's husband like?"<br/>"Hm. Good question. Why don't you tell me what he's like and I'll just play that."<br/>*her head explodes*<br/><br/>There was actually a lot of struggling. I never gave them clear answers. Problems were open-ended. Generally, I just reacted to what they were doing. In one of the first plots the landlord of their Chancel was dying. I had their Imperator come in and be like, "OK, this human is almost used up. Find another one." They then proceeded to investigate ways of making her immortal which I did not anticipate at all.<br/><br/>So anyway, that leads to this. Game over. Post-mortem. You guys have any feedback for me?<br/><br/>"Well, I had fun, but you led us around by the nose too much."<br/><br/>I actually laughed out loud. I then talked about what I did, how I prep, how everything I did was reacting to what they were doing. It was interesting. After I did that they were like, "Oooh. Everything seemed like such a natural progression it seemed like you came in with a story in mind."<br/><br/>I wondered how long they'd thought this. I mean, maybe I did lead them by the nose but I really don't think I did.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was interesting and kind of funny. If you've played with me (which an odd few people on here have) you might know that I suck big-time at prepped, linear stories. I can't do them very well even if I try. My most recent D&amp;D game is an example of that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167907/#Comment_167907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T06:48:32+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  6:48AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've often seen the same thing, again with people who are used to linear plots.

Players would say things like, "How did you know we were going to do that?  I don't understand how you planned all this out."<br><br>I didn't plan it out.<br><br>The first time I played BW with Luke Crane was several Gen Con's ago.  We were playing The Gift (Elves vs. Dwarves!) and Jeff was gaming with us too and we were having a splendid time.  But one player was sitting there, really upset and perturbed.<br><br>When Luke went to the bathroom, obviously thrilled with where the game was going, the upset player spoke up, "This isn't what he had <i>planned</i>.  We're messing up the game!"<br/><br/>I tried to make him feel better but he seemed really edgy until he found a hand-hold for his character in the later scenes but his anguish really stayed with me.  I make a point of saying something to players when I run con scenarios about not having any idea where this is all going.  "I don't have an end-point in mind, all I did was write up a solid starting point and I'm going to go with your flow, here and push on you in interesting ways, not to get you to a certain set-up end-point but to keep things in motion."<br/><br/>The reactions I get from that speech are always interesting, from nodding to verbal affirmations ("That is how a good DM should work!") to looks with a bit of fear in 'em.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167924/#Comment_167924" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T07:31:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  7:31AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Bret:  I've had people who played<em>Capes</em>with me tell me afterwards that I was too railroady as a GM, and I should have given them room to do what they wanted instead of forcing them to my agenda.</blockquote>\nHoly shit that is interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167927/#Comment_167927" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T08:07:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  8:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was like "WHAT?

I think this misconception is unfortunately the source of a lot of railroading when people take it a step further: "Therefore when I GM, I am going to write an awesome story in advance".  This means that players who are future GMs can learn railroading not only from railroady GMs, but from non-railroady GMs too, if they misunderstand what their non-railroady GM is doing.<br/><br/>For that reason, I think this approach is cool:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I make a point of saying something to players when I run con scenarios about not having any idea where this is all going.  "I don't have an end-point in mind, all I did was write up a solid starting point and I'm going to go with your flow, here and push on you in interesting ways, not to get you to a certain set-up end-point but to keep things in motion."</blockquote>\nThese players are not only being informed about what they are getting into before the game, they are also learning about GMing.  Next time they go to run a game, maybe they will say "I had so much fun in that game where that GM was working with the players rather than planning in advance.

But seems to work every time.</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w179/kingpoopa84/1176387326941.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167966/#Comment_167966" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:06:30+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:06AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret, <br/><br/>You tell the best stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167970/#Comment_167970" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:20:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:20AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's funny because I've been wanting to tell this story to Judd for a week and I kept forgetting and I was like, "Oh crap, I should tell Story Games."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167972/#Comment_167972" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:23:34+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's funny because I've been wanting to tell this story to Judd for a week and I kept forgetting and I was like, "Oh crap, I should tell Story Games."</blockquote>\nThat is really funny.

Sometimes when my players  win a conflict, and thus gain a narrative right, they don't always want to use it. Sometimes they're more interested in being rewarded with privileged knowledge on which they can act. So I've changed tactics: When a player wins a conflict, I ask if the player wants the narrative right (some always says yes, others often says no), or if they want information from me (even if they know that I am improvising).<br/><br/>The thing is, that some players seems to be not comfortable with improvising, but mainly it seems more likely that they are focused on acting their characters, than having a (narrative) control of the story. So when offering the right to narrative control or to gain (privileged) knowledge (i.e. the character knows something nobody else knows) on which to act their role. In this manner everyone is satisfied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168158/#Comment_168158" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T05:36:16+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  5:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>There's always the slight possibility that people mean different things when they say "leading by the nose" - they might just not use the same vocabulary we're used to.

My experience with seriously GM-led players has been positive, but I've taken a different tack: I've come in with the usual "GM authority", directing what's going on, very forcefully, but let them do the actual work. Mostly this is because a bunch of old-school D&amp;D players asked me to run a game with a) no preparation (no forward notice), and b) in a pretty constrained time situation, so we all wanted to get cracking as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Instead of:<br/><br/>"What's my husband like?"<br/>"Well, I don't know. What <i>is</i> he like?"<br/>"Ummm..."<br/><br/>I came in and said,<br/><br/>"OK. The scenario takes place on an island. You, Bob, draw a map of the island and tell me what's on it. You, Jenny, name me one important character on the island."<br/>"Uh, you mean like a governor?"<br/>"Yeah. Now Bill, write down three character traits the governor has..."<br/>etc...<br/><br/>So, it was the players making stuff up as much as possible, but I went into it head-first and fully in charge, so they never had time to react or question what I was doing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't get to talk to them too much about it afterwards. I wouldn't be <i>completely</i> surprised if they thought they had just played through a linear scenario afterwards...<br/><br/>I wonder about the whole "proof of free will" thing. If you come in to a game with players like that and you say, "OK. I am NOT railroading. I'll show you: I am going to tell you exactly what I have planned to happen in this session." Of course, then they might just play out what you told them.<br/><br/>What if you <i>write down</i> how you think things will turn out, and then show them the paper at the end of the session (when, presumably, things have gone completely differently)? Well, they can <i>still</i> accuse you railroading, I guess, and just claim that you lied about the stuff you wrote on the paper.

I've had players who refuse to believe that everything wasn't scripted, because  I wasn't struggling to GM                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168463/#Comment_168463" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T05:37:59+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  5:37AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a part of it.<br/><br/>"You always seemed to know what you were doing so we thought it was planned."

He looked at me like I was crazy.<br/><br/>"How can you GM a game without planning it in advance? I would just be chaos."<br/><br/>And I'm like, "Dude, when you play a game, do you plan what your character's gonna do in advance?  Of course not, right?  You just roleplay your character, right?"<br/><br/>"Well, yeah."<br/><br/>"And I'm doing <i>the exact same thing</i> as GM, except I've got more characters and I have to 'roleplay' the environment too."<br/><br/>He started nodding, but in that kind-of "I'm not really getting this, just nodding to be polite" way.

They've sorta cheated by prompting the GM, "Does our Chancel have X in it?" They want it to have X in it. They just told you, "I want our Chancel to have X in it, but I don't want to blow my flow by figuring out how that all works. That's your job, clever GM!"

Pre-programmed adventures for solitaire play with pregenerated characters are an excellent idea. Those Choose Your Own Adventure books put out by TSR (and Steve Jackson) in the early days were a<br/>clever way to get some people into the hobby by giving them a taste of what it's like and making them want more. Maybe we should revive them.<br/><br/>The essence of the RPG experience is character creation and prepared adventure scenarios. That's what makes it what it is.

Instead of "does it have X in it" you can try something like, "is it the kind of Y that has X in it?" or even "explain what kind of X you mean", and, as they explain, their explanation becomes reality, unless it's so unbelievable that they flounder and drop the idea, realizing that they were asking out of hope and not because the idea made sense to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168812/#Comment_168812" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T18:39:10+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  6:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What can I tell you?

And as we don't get to make up the world we live in, they didn't want to make up the world they were experiencing. The on the fly thing was more of a sticky issue, and seemed to do with the idea that if I was making stuff up on the fly it wasn't as real, or as stable. I might be tempted to include things because of what they wanted at the moment, or to screw them in the moment, rather than because of the world's intrinsic quality. I'm fairly sure they felt (maybe rightly, I dunno) that if I made stuff up away from them, the table, and the moment -- or if I got it out of a book by someone who didn't even know us -- then it was more likely to be authentic to the world and less subject to bias and interpretation of the moment. If they felt that the world had become biased, it hurt the experience of game for them. <br/><br/>Neither of them ever said that games that didn't do this were RPGs, but they did say that they didn't have as much fun in games where they couldn't get it. (Also, they hated railroading, they wanted to be able to go and do what they wanted -- and no, they didn't give a shit about story. In fact, they didn't really want the game to have a story, as far as I remember. And yes, that's why I eventually drifted away from playing with them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168871/#Comment_168871" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T10:38:59+00:00" title="September 13, 2008 10:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ignotus wrote: <i>"Does one just have to make up on the spot one or more clever mystically-significant tasks for them to undertake, or is there a trick to answering this sort of unexpected question without prep in such a way that accomplishing the goal (i.e. making the person immortal) will be a fun and entertaining process?"</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWell... The Landlords of Chancels generally <i>are</i> immortal, and in any case granting, say, eternal youth (or just about any other boon that you can think of) to someone as long as they never stray beyond the boundaries of the realm for longer than a day is well covered by the actual mechanics of the game.

I used to have lots of fun playing like this. It's a different focus--kind of like how reading the "Atlas of Middle Earth" is a different experience from reading "Lord of the Rings". I haven't done that in years, though, because a) I don't have the time to put in to make it happen and make it fun, and b) I haven't seen a good way of doing that doesn't end up being a GM fiat/railroad festival of some sort that makes the players feel useless. <br/><br/>I have a possibly naive and misplaced hope that those people feel like me.

Playing a game is essentially putting your thoughts in a box. You have to think a certain way in order to get anywhere with the game.  I think that just about anyone that has played RPGs has experienced their first magic moment where all the work finally comes together into a thrilling experience.<br/><br/>So, after that experience they try to reproduce it by hopping into that exact same box, or something that looks a lot like it. Most of the gamers that want to be lead around are probably used to traditional RPGs where the GM is the player's only window on the world and the story is already ":told" and all you need is to add heroes and stir. This leads to some very passive/reactive thinking. Players used to that would be disturbed by being asked to think actively because it it outside the box they are used to, and may not produce the wonderful experience they are looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168907/#Comment_168907" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T18:35:04+00:00" title="September 13, 2008  6:35PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be.

It is a stance that places <i>"the supreme scenario"</i> and <i>"the almighty GM"</i> in a semi-mythical sphere above <i>"the ordinary players"</i>.<br/><br/>In my view it is a very convenient stance, placing the players in a false position of non-responcibility. It is totally untrue in regards to what a scenario really is, what a GM actually represent, and what players may achieve with their imagination, interaction and ability to improvise. Good methods for making use of the inherent player-abilities, as most classical games does too, may make any fiction come true.<br/><br/>However: the classical RPG, with the GM in a key-role, is a very well tested formula with the power to instigate truly remarkable gameplay.

I myself don't like all improve all the time, because you do seem to get a lot of you lead us by the nose the whole time, whether its because the players really don't know any better, or if because they had to be lead by the nose threw a new power structuring technique, well you can make up your own mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169179/#Comment_169179" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:49:51+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Players need to spend some time GMing, so they can disabuse themselves of the notion that good GMs don't make (lots and lots of) stuff up on the fly.<br/><br/>p.</blockquote>\nI see the same assumptions from experienced GMs, though.

Why would that make you unhappy? Why is it nok okay to be improvising to create either goal?

There's no planned sequence of scenes, no planned outcome. It's just a starting point, and the evolution of the scenario is completely a product of the interactions of the participants.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, the players operate almost entirely through the agency available to their characters, and the GM "role plays" the non-player actors and events according to their own internal logic. Oh, the players and GM might collaborate a bit on fleshing out the setting. It's not like the GM knows beforehand if all the dogs in town are brown; if a player suddenly needs a brown dog, you can roll dice or say yes. Likewise the GM isn't going to perfectly "channel" the NPCs, if such a thing even makes sense; there will be elements of whimsy, maybe some dice rolls. But the GM is playing "in the moment" without regard to achieving particular outcomes or modulating the dramatic quality of the game.<br/><br/>How can you tell the difference? Improvisation can be too perfect, too pat from a "story" perspective. That <i>might</i> be what was going on in the original post. I mean, what I read over and over in Brett's account in this thread is that the players were used to not having control over the <i>backstories</i> and <i>setting</i> of their character. While these elements can be handled in a bunch of ways, some more collaborative than others, they don't in and of themselves dictate the path and outcome of a scenario. Also, collaboration \u2260 no prep \u2260 no "GM-led story". The players might have written up all the details of their chancel, husband's personality, etc., before the game, and that would still leave open whether the game would end up being a "GM led story" or a situational jumping off point.<br/><br/>So it's possible that the players felt "led around by the nose" because they felt the game lacked the accidental quality of player actions blundering into a prepped situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169446/#Comment_169446" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T11:12:15+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 11:12AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Again, I don't know if we're crossing terminologies or if you really don't get me, but "GM-led story" isn't even on the map when I refer to "prepared situation."

What is of interest is what people actually <i>do</i>.<br/><br/>As Jesse just pointed out, as an example, Eliot plays exactly how <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> are prepped and played.  It's exactly how I run games of <i>Sorcerer</i>, and how I run games using the <i>HeroQuest</i> rules.  <br/><br/>The truth is, I have no idea how Bret prepped and ran his game.  He wrote, "I then talked about what I did, how I prep, how everything I did was reacting to what they were doing."  But, technically, that gave me no information!  Not that what he did was good or bad.  My assumption was he prepped like I do (and Eliot, for that matter).  But just now I took some time to think about it... and the truth is I don't know what his prep is, I don't know what he means by reacting to what the players do.<br/><br/>Whether it's worth breaking that out, I don't know.  But I do know I'm watching people begin to talk at cross-purposes as they assume people do or don't do things as they do, but, in fact, might do exactly the same things when prepping or playing -- or in fact be doing things exactly differently.<br/><br/><br/>Edited to Add:  And even the brief description Eliot offered is just a taste of similarity to my own prep and play.  In broad strokes, yes...  we GM in very similar fashion.  But there will be many details of prep and play where we differer, overlap and maybe could even learn from.  As is the case with everyone here. (At least in my eyes.)

(Robert might have an idea of where you are going with the ""there's also a wide divergence in the purpose of the improv that does occur" but I have no idea.)  I'd love to hear more about what you consider GM manipulation of reality; clearly every GM is manipulating and creating some aspects of the game's reality on the fly since there's no reality there to use.  But some application is considered good, some bad.  I'd love to hear more about your boundaries.  And I didn't know what you meant by "out-of-character control in mid-game" exactly.  I'm assuming you're referring to things like spending fan mail for more cards in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> or points in <i>Nobilis</i>.  Is this what you're talking about.  If so, could you explain more about how it pertains to the conversation at hand.  (And by the way, I understand completely how this kind of activity throws some people out-of-sorts.  But the people playing in the original post suggested the GM was leading by the nose.  Are you saying that feeling out sorts that way made them feel they were being led by the nose?)<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and as for the scenario in the <i>Sorcerer</i> book, you're quite right.  But even Ron says, in the paragraph introducing the section:  "This section provides a practically ready-to-run Sorcerer night that takes about half an hour to set up and go, and only a single evening to run.  <i>It's nowhere near coherent enough to be used as the basis of a real game, of course</i>, but the idea is to have some fun and see how the rules work."  [emphasis added]<br/><br/>So, yes, the scenario flies in the face of everything set up in the book.  But does so with a clear disclaimer (in my view) that you're not playing what has been set up in the rest of the book.  While I can see as much confusion as help coming from the inclusion of the scenario.  Still, it's clearly marked off.

It's easy to say, "Oh, that's just improv", but it's strongly motivated improv that works off a very wide leeway in use of the pre-existing facts of the scenario.<br/><br/>By that I mean--sure, if you make use of the interstices of prep, you can improvise anything, but there's a point that strains credibility and undermines the legitimacy of the prep. If you don't define the cop's personality beforehand, then you can slot something in on the spur of the moment that'll hit character X's character issues <i>perfectly</i>. Say, character X has an aversion to violence but a dedication to standing up for the little guy, so you decide that the cop'll put the beat down on a hapless immigrant right in front of the character...and nobody else seems willing to do anything...so it's all up to him. Awesome! Conflict! Hard decisions! Well, some people might like that, but to me it feels heavy-handed, contrived, and shallow.<br/><br/>Difference of quality or degree? Maybe you could work up to the conflict, lay the groundwork, give players a chance to get to know their characters and the NPCs. The DitV GMing section has something similar--the idea that you can give a player an easy decision in Town A, then push against that decision in Town B, keep going until a sort of crisis point is reached. In theory it still sounds contrived; in practice I haven't seen it either in person or in actual play reports. Every instance I've seen of people mindfully applying the Bang/Conflict/Escalation strategy, I've been turned off--except where the game is so radically outside the norm that there's no doubt it's an altogether different thing from what I think of as character-perspective roleplaying. (E.g., <i>Polaris</i> still looks like it could be fun.)<br/><br/>So how does the GM make improvised decisions? Randomly. Unconsciously. Whimsically. Falling back on local tropes of the group and general tropes of genre. Extrapolating from the known to the unknown. Depending on the mood at the table, the GM might also choose to bridge from one piece of prep to another--a kind of "say yes". But not with an especially strong aim to push conflicts toward crisis and resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169567/#Comment_169567" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T00:32:04+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 12:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering, though, how creating an evil cop whose beating up an innocent on the fly is more heavy handed than (a) creating a bang like "Player A will come across a cruel cop beating an innocent man" or (b) designing a raft of NPCs including a "cruel cop named brown who likes to beat innocent men whenever he can get away with it"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169572/#Comment_169572" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T03:26:21+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  3:26AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher Kubasik wrote: <i>"And I didn't know what you meant by 'out-of-character control in mid-game' exactly. I'm assuming you're referring to things like spending fan mail for more cards in Primetime Adventures or points in Nobilis."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a tiny clarification to those who might not be familiar with the game, spending miracle points in <i>Nobilis</i> is only an OOC factor in the same sense as rolling dice would be in a randomized system. They reflect the effort that characters may put into accomplishing their goals (the attribute ratings alone determine what someone can achieve effortlessly, while the point pools associated with each attribute measure how much further they can push themselves in an emergency), instead of acting as "drama points" which would allow players to narrate events beyond the control of the PCs during play. There are no "metagame" mechanics for anything of the sort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div

But I can certainly believe that a GM might see that the point of the games is to bring in Bangs or threaten Issues like a hammer that doesn't care about context.  (By contrast I ran a game of <i>The Mountain Witch</i> that seemed very forced a lot of the time.  I wasn't pleased with it.  But I put that squarely on my shoulders as being awkward with the rules.)<br/><br/>In my experience (as Player and GM) all the Issue Stuff that felt "heavy-handed, contrived, and shallow" usually comes about in ways very natural, organic and really engaging.  I finished up a <i>Sorcerer</i> game of many sessions and the response from the players was, "You never forced us toward anything."  They had a kind of amazed look on their faces after the wrap up of the last game as we discussed if they liked the game <i>Sorcerer</i>.  They were in the drivers seat the whole time in the game, and they didn't know, as a GM, you could let the Players do that.  I don't think I changed anything arbitrarily about the reality to get any Bangs... simply let NPCs with pre-defined agenda push against what the PCs wanted or other NPCs.  (Though, for complete disclosure, what the NPCs wanted shifted as they responded to actions of the PCs and other NPCs.)<br/><br/>Your comments are colored by the phrase "except where the game is so radically outside the <b>norm</b> that there's no doubt it's an altogether different thing from what I think of as character-perspective roleplaying."  Was my game of <i>Sorcerer</i> normal?  The games I run are very collaborative, there's lots of talking back and forth between everyone at the table outside of character to make sure we're clear about characters and background.  It sounds like that would drive you nuts.  On the other hand, I can't pretend to know if you'd have a good time in a game I would run.  The way you described the application of Bangs or Issues seems like taloned monkeys with wings swooping out of the sky arbitrarily and shouting BANG! independent of any context of characters or fiction -- which is so alien to my understanding of how to effectively play this stuff it seems like a caricature of these techniques.  (As for GMs placing PCs in direct conflict with one another -- I don't know how you do that.  The Players either want to have their PCs be in conflict -- or not.  Right?)<br/><br/>I can only say that the game I play seem completely normal to me.  I have no idea still how you play.  Either the fun is had, or it isn't.  It sounds like you've had some terrible experiences with people shoving one crappy moral dilemma after another at you, irrespective of the fiction, the characters and whatnot.  <br/><br/>The example you gave about the cop sounded drawn neither from a play experience of your own, or a posting from the internet, but I'll assume you laid out what seems to be a cartoon summation of all your bad experiences: "We had characters.  We're walking down the street.  Everyone at the table knows my guy has a thing about violence and underdogs.  And suddenly the GM has a cop jump out and start beating up an immigrant.  Having nothing to do with the rest of the game.  It all seemed so contrived!"  Well, yeah.  That would be!  And if that's what you've been subjected to, I'd also walk away -- whether it was <i>GURPS</i> or <i>Sorcerer</i>.   As always, I prefer examples from actual games.  But I'm guessing that isn't going to happen.  Hypotheticals always open the door to, "But what if they were Dogs, who saw the town elder beating an Indian, and that Elder was all tied to town's Sins, so it wasn't arbitrary, and the Dogs are the cops who have to make a judgement!"  Which is an easy way to take the cartoon example and put it in a context that starts off a session that <i>isn't</i> working "off a very wide leeway in use of the pre-existing facts of the scenario."  But then we're just spinning hypothetical examples off an hypothetical example... which is fine for college sophomores, but which I find incredibly dull these days.<br/><br/>You've given me a lot to chew on... given the fact I'm writing a book about <i>Sorcerer</i> and these very issues: How do you do it well.  Because it seems like you've had really shitty arbitrary encounters with some of this stuff.  And I have seen <i>horrible</i> uses of Bangs recorded on the Internet.  I know they are out there!<br/><br/>But, again, your use of the word "norm" betrays something else is going on here.  I like Player driven scenarios with conflicts framed by the GM, for example.  You probably don't.  (Or do!  I don't know!)  But to swing it around to this thread again, you made a lot of assumptions about what Bret did with forcing dumb, arbitrary moral dilemmas upon his players (right? which is why you brought this up?) -- which is why they said "You led us by the nose!"  Bret assumed they meant a plot (which he didn't have), and you sniffed out the truth and realized it was dumb, arbitrary moral dilemmas that made the players feel led by the nose.  I mean, I can only assume you made these assumptions, since you brought all this stuff up.  Which, if correct, would make Sherlock Holmes proud since I know I didn't see the clues lying around his posts.  Your reaction all seems kind of weird to me.  But, again, given the book I'm writing, discussing how to not make Bangs suck is vital and I'm glad you brought this up.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169597/#Comment_169597" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T07:28:50+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  7:28AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Janne,<br/><br/>Got it.

Just to make things crystal clear, they thought that I had a pre-planned plot which I was railroading them down to a foregone conclusion. I'm not making any assumptions about what my players felt and why - they told me flat out. I did not have a foregone conclusion, I did not have a preplanned plot, therefore it was impossible for me to to lead them by the nose in the way they thought I did. We discussed it and all thought it was funny. As Christopher says, I don't feel like Eliot is talking about what I'm talking about at all.

I'd love to hear more about what you consider GM manipulation of reality; clearly every GM is manipulating and creating some aspects of the game's reality on the fly since there's no reality there to use.  But some application is considered good, some bad.  I'd love to hear more about your boundaries.  And I didn't know what you meant by "out-of-character control in mid-game" exactly.

If so, could you explain more about how it pertains to the conversation at hand.  (And by the way, I understand completely how this kind of activity throws some people out-of-sorts.

Are you saying that feeling out sorts that way made them feel they were being led by the nose?)</blockquote>\nOkay, you're asking about three things: Purpose of the improv, GM manipulation, and OOC control. Suspended from the last is "what does OOC control have to do with being led by the nose?"<br/><br/>Purpose of improv: The overriding purpose is to fill in blanks while maintaining an air of verisimilitude, rather than seeking to put characters on the spot. Now,  you may say, "That's not how I play", or "that's a clumsy application of the principles". To which I shrug and point at dozens of examples supported by theories of Narrativism and the theoretical grouping of a subset, under Narrativism, of modes that eschew abstract verbalization or conscious address of "issues"--which implies that there's also a grouping, perhaps the default, where abstract verbalization, or conscious address of "issues" is indeed what's going on. Furthermore I think that any discussion of whether issues are addressed unconsciously is muddled by unconscious selection--"issues" come and go.<br/><br/>But that's already an overly defensive response--necessitated only by the fact that the theory growing out of Story Now has become a totalizing structure in practice--serving both to exclude (exaggerating differences between ideal "agendas") and to coopt (negating real differences in preference). In actual practice I think I have a use for certain techniques such as "Flag Framing". Lately I've been working up a questionnaire in my head where one of the questions will be something like, "Are there any pressing issues or conflicts that will impact your character immediately?" Or "How directly or obliquely do you want initial scenarios to incorporate aspects of your character's background and relationships?" The idea is to treat character-creation as an element of collaborative world-building and scenario-creation.<br/><br/>But that's a digression. The point is: there are games where the pushing of buttons is quite overt and quite direct, and clearly motivated by timing and pacing. If the GM has bullet-points for each character, as a reminder to build toward or pop up with a specific conflict ("try to hit 'sense of justice" vs. 'nonviolence')--bleah.<br/><br/>That segues into "GM manipulation", particularly as it touches the idea of "escalation". Let's say we've got a character who has serious issues with his father--maybe the father beat him as a kid, or did something even more unspeakable. Or the father's a gangster and the son's a cop. So the scenario proceeds more or less naturally toward a conflict between father and son--maybe there's a family crisis, the son confronts the father, and it turns into a fight in a hotel room. Ergo, if the GM doesn't think things have been pushed far enough, well, there's a gun! On the nightstand! Nobody says there <i>wasn't</i> one, right? Bleah. It's transparent, melodramatic, railroady in a small way for the GM to add or subtract setting elements, or alter NPC* goals and motivations, specifically to ramp up the tension. (Another aside: I'd prefer, if the GM or anyone else thought having a gun would be plausible and interesting for any reason, to roll dice. If it's plausible but not a given, and there's a likelihood that personal judgment is going to be colored by dramatic concerns, there's no harm in rolling dice, right? This is another way of saying that the integrity of the fiction is more important than any fleeting notion of what anybody wants.)<br/><br/>Finally, OOC control is a very simple concept. I don't know anything about PTA or Nobilis. I'm just talking about a player being able to declare things about the setting and have them be true, in ways that a character couldn't. You know, like in Dogs you can say you have a relationship with an NPC if you've got the dice. Or if winning a conflict gets you "narration rights" or "stakes" that extend into control over details of the setting or backstory--I win, so I get to narrate an elaborate scheme that my character planned and which now comes to fruition! (Or, "There's a horse under the window!" Or, "The mayor's a serial killer!")<br/><br/>I don't have control over those things in real life. In small doses and certain contexts, I think those things can be fun in RPGs. But there's a vast range--and for that matter, I think this is addressed in the Forge thread I linked, so you can look there if my wording leaves you mystified.<br/><br/>EDIT: Original edit removed. *Also, typo corrected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169720/#Comment_169720" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T16:28:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  4:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2008 4:58PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eliot, <br/><br/>I thank you for taking the time to reply.<br/><br/>You keep using these bizarro and hamfisted hypotheticals to make points about people doing things I don't see happening in Actual Play.

I can't say if the techniques were all drawn directly from those books or also from discussion at the Forge, Vincent Baker's blog, etc. Maybe the GMs did a crappy job or we didn't connect. That's why I say that you can always talk about differences of degree in application while retaining some appreciation for concepts. But it's where the rubber hits the road that really matters, right? So I look not only at the rules, and my crappy experiences*; I also look at the APs that are touted as awesome!!! and I see a pretty wide gulf of interest and taste between myself and the examples provided.<br/><br/>*Crappy isn't entirely fair. I actually had fun while playing TMW, but I found the game itself pretty unsubstantial, and I sold my copy. Now, the interesting thing about TMW is that I still think it could be a good game (IMO of course), but to be such, it'd have to have much more of the situation nailed down in prep, from the geography of the setting to the nature of the Dark Fates. (There are other things I'd change--not the trust mechanic!--but mainly it's the improvisational drive to conflict that I disliked.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169738/#Comment_169738" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T17:57:52+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  5:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So Elliot,<br/><br/>I take it you're not so much on No Myth play? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>I dunno, I've been looking at Mythic RPG and it might be right up my alley.

If you give a shit about in-your-face conflict, then you get conflicts in your face. If you care more about making your way through a fictional world, then yeah, having conflicts shoved into your face is gonna feel contrived.<br/><br/>From a totally practical standpoint, I feel like there's something to be said in favor of systems/approaches/techniques that try and identify shit the players actually care about. The approaches that pull you out of you-are-there character immersion? Very much a matter of taste.

Another pair of players were having a scene (it involved a woman and her sick mother, where we knew that the woman wanted her mother to sign over all her possessions to her) and it had barely started before people were shouting CONFLICT! and grabbing dice. I was totally thrown, wondering where the hell that had come from, because it hadn't been established in the fiction. That was a system-led drive to conflict perhaps, more than an improv-led one, but you could see that everyone *knew* the scene was *about* this conflict, and so they rushed into it as if it were all that mattered.<br/><br/>The same can easily apply as a GM. You get it into your head that this scene must be *about* something and you keep driving that way, to the extent that it does indeed become a railroad, not in terms of specific events, but in terms of the kind of events you are going to have. My own experience tells me that I'm more likely to do this when I have prepared less and am improvising more, because I get carried away, or I don't stop to think about what I'm doing. A bit more preparation can help to ground me and remind me I don't have to actually drive anything anywhere                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169805/#Comment_169805" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T06:01:42+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  6:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 6:01AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>The same can easily apply as a GM.

I've been in a game (or three) where the GM basically wanted to set up inter-party conflict, to basically have the theme of the game geared towards player conflict.  Even though we, as players, felt fine with getting together and working together towards a common goal. So the GM kept pulling out things and setting up obvious situations for us to basically have to get at each others' throats to get anything done. So finally we bit, in a kind of "OK, ok, I get it... Uh, I do X and keep it a secret from Z. Then I kill Y, who is an ally of player Z." etc. <br/><br/>In a way, that felt as thematically railroady as if we were players who wanted to Talk to a big boss, but the GM kept doing things to require us to Fight him instead.<br/><br/>I haven't seen it often, mind you, but I can totally see where Hituro is coming from. It probably comes down to the whole quantum mechanical "the existence of a GM means an influence towards the kind of play the GM is fond of seeing" thing.

It's not like saying "The players keep forcing each other into social conflict in The Roach!" or "The GM keeps pushing us into issues of trust and betrayal in The Mountain Witch!", because that's what those games are all about. This is more like a GM having a lot of fun and success with The Mountain Witch, and thus running everything from D&amp;D to Star Wars into situations where betrayal and trust are the central thing (when the players are expecting/wanting to team up and kick ass; whereas before when they were playing TMW, they were expecting/wanting trust and betrayal).<br/><br/>Or in Hituro's example, picking up some methodology cues from games like PTA (or more like play examples read about PTA which use words like "driving to conflict"), and applying it to other games (shouting "Conflict!" and reaching for dice, when the roleplaying is just barely picking up).<br/><br/>This is sort of a total side topic, though.

Because I've run Shadowrun games out of a book in which we literally went through the book chapter by chapter and had the players deny any kind of railroading, and I've run Dogs games in which the players felt railroaded because NPCs beat them in conflicts and forced them to react in general ways. <br/><br/>For the Shadowrun group it wasn't a railroad, because going point to point and shooting shit was what they wanted and expected from the game. In Dogs it was a railroad because the group was used to games in which characters can never have their behavior altered by NPCs, and so really disliked it, felt confined, and guided inexorably towards something. <br/><br/>And sure, that something was there, it wasn't a plot point, but it was a certain intensity or theme of play. Which isn't normally described as a railroad, but which if you watch you'll see a lot of players who have problems with certain types of story driven games complaining at. Really, the very fact that a lot of us like some story games because they reliably deliver a set range of story is, to those who are used to a more diffuse style, a railroad -- it leads you down a path in a way you don't like.<br/><br/>The irony here being that this particular piece of jargon really comes from a normal use word -- to railroad, which means to convict with undue haste and by means of false charges or insufficient evidence OR to push through hastily or without due consideration. So if you're doing things to your players without due consideration of what they want and how it impacts their enjoyment of the game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169900/#Comment_169900" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T12:16:36+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 12:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of derailing things again I'd just like to say that Andy has it bang on for what I was getting at.

Since none of the details of the situation were prepared in a concrete way, the "aboutness" amounted to verbally encouraging the players to make up stuff on the fly that would frame their token betrayals. We had Dark Fates, but they weren't <i>things</i>, just bullet-points suggesting stuff to use as a motivation for the character's betrayals (practically after the fact). The GM introduced some complications at certain points but it felt like they were arbitrarily created to screw with us. By which I mean, at one point the GM introduced some evidence implying that my character was really an agent of the enemy, so I had to think on my feet. Was I really concerned about convincing the other players that I was innocent? Of course not, they knew just as well as I that my character had no real background. So, instead, it was about putting on a good show or finding a way to derail the scene.<br/><br/>Which come to think of it, was what messed up another player, who had something similar thrown at him, failed--or refused--to come up with a token fictive "proof" of his innocence, and was swept to his death via the logic of the fiction.<br/><br/>The game would have been much cooler if the Dark Fates had been nailed down from the start in conjunction with the GM, the GM had scrambled them together a bit and worked up some fixed back-story. Then when player X betrayed player Y, it'd be because X really needed to, not because of a textual mandate to drive your character toward conflict in the abstract. (Doubly troublesome since not only betrayal but trust--the mechanic--had no underlying justification other than momentary whim or trying to second-guess someone else's narrative agenda. By that I mean the story they were interested in telling, as opposed to what their character is objectively about.)<br/><br/><i>Diplomacy</i> players might have a stronger sense of what I'm talking about. Or for that matter the players of the recent Braunstein games at Origins.<br/><br/>Since I no longer own the game I can't check if the methods actually used were out of the book. But they are emblematic of the types of improv that give me trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170004/#Comment_170004" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T23:17:12+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have TMW but I'm wondering why anyone would want to prove to the other characters that they were innocent while playing a game about trust and betrayal.

The game's themes, those tapestries hanging on the wall, are all trust and betrayal. It doesn't mean that they have to taint every single interaction in the game.<br/><br/>So, frex, what I think might be going on is that there's a lot of trust and betrayal "out there", but in this one instance Elliot's character had this nascent friendship with another character. Or at least wanted to play that up or something. And I'm all for that: A strong friendship in that game is hot: It provides a lot of contrast to the other stuff going on... and later on, if those bonds have to be weakened or broken, then that is more dramatic as well. <br/>But it sounds like here, no matter how hard Elliot (the player) tried to set up a friendship/loyal relationship, the other *player* wasn't having any. Thinking that his character could get screwed at any time, he took "innocence" off the table. Which can be a function of a tMW GM pushing too hard (or a bunch of other things, too).<br/>It's like a game of Diplomacy: If *no one* comes out of their shell and starts making alliances at all, then that can make the game slow and problematic.<br/><br/>Also, I've only played one shots of tMW, and I've experienced some of the things that Elliot was describing above, complete with the realization that "we have no story, we're just making it up on the fly, and it's up to the other player to allow or deny me "access" to their character by going with or denying these fictive relationships". I mean, in all RPGs it's the case, but in this case it's a little more noticable.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, in the above case I suspect that Elliot only played a one-shot (correct me if I'm wrong, Elliot), in which case these things are a lot more noticable. I've heard that the "optimal" game is 3 sessions or more, which basically sets up enough character interaction that those relationships feel more real, and character background emerges enough to "ground" those relationships, so it feels a lot less like shifting sands. It basically becomes like most other RPGs out there.<br/>For me, the only problem is that tMW doesn't have that much mechnically going on to keep me interested in more than one session games of it. Sort of a weird paradox (Eric Provost swears on it, and regularly played/ran 3+ session games where it eventually got past the feelings that me and Elliot experienced... problem is that for me, there's a lot of other games that I'd rather play multi-session games of first, so I've never gotten around to participating in a "mountain witch campaign").<br/><br/>Anyway, this thread is probably a legion of dead horses at this point, but I'd be happy if we could crank up the "let's see what this looks like from someone else's* shoes" lever.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* == Elliot.** <br/><br/>**He's not being jerky, just describing shit he's seen, and there's no flame wars or wailing in the night or anything, yet I still can't help but to feel that he's getting tea-bagged in a few threads these last few days by folks unwilling to extend some empathy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170056/#Comment_170056" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T07:29:26+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  7:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tea-bagged?

The game's themes, those tapestries hanging on the wall, are all trust and betrayal. It doesn't mean that they have to taint every single interaction in the game.<br/><br/>Thinking that his character could get screwed at any time, he took "innocence" off the table. Which can be a function of a tMW GM pushing too hard (or a bunch of other things, too).<br/>Interesting. Maybe I'm just weird. My thought on reading your post was I don't think I would require proof of innocence to develop a strong, trusting and loyal friendship. I would just decide that my character firmly <i>believed</i> he was innocent. Since, neither player really knows at this point whether he's innocent or not, wouldn't innocence or guilt get sorted out later? If he's innocent, then cool, I'm the loyal friend who stuck by through all the doubt and finger pointing. If he's guilty, then cool, I'm the sucker who get's duped and hung out to dry by my traitorous friend. Or, maybe I miss the point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170334/#Comment_170334" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T18:48:53+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  6:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 6:50PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>That seems to water down the meaning of "railroad" to where it's meaningless.

"What do you mean I have to play a Dog? Is this a railroad?" It's only happened once but it did happen in this exact way.
