I'm a fan of Kingdom Hearts, so if this seems familiar, there may be a reason.<br/><br/>Premise: <br/>The characters grew up together as children. The adventure is about to begin, but right now the characters are sitting back and remembering the good old days when they were kids.<br/><br/>Process:<br/>Character creation is done by reminiscence. The players start with the major arcana from a Tarot deck spread out in front of them. Everyone picks a name for their character. Then someone starts the building process by saying, "(Name), I remember when..." and gives a short story about that character that exemplifies a particular trait. That player picks a Major Arcana card appropriate to the trait and gives it to the character. This continues around the table, more or less evenly spread out, until each character has four cards. <br/><br/>If someone gives your character a card you don't want him/her to have, you can turn it away by saying, "No, that's not how it happened. What really happened was..." and describing how things really went. You get to pick a replacement card. You can only do this once.<br/><br/><br/>I tried this out with two of my friends about two years ago and just remembered it recently. It went really well. Sadly the game kind of died after the second session, but the creation process made characters with strong ties to each other. The tarot cards were used in the game: major arcana represented the characters' major powers/abilities and minor arcana were used for task resolution.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368465/#Comment_368465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T10:39:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 10:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great idea.

Penny could be great for this. Penny doesn't automatically link the characters together, though it can be done, you'll probably need to play it a couple of times to learn the basics before twisting it for this purpose. You'd also need to modify the questionnaire to fit the new conceit. And a session is usually 3-4 hours long (with 4 or 5 people), which is a pretty intense character creation process, but I've seen worse, and this way you'll end up with compelling stories to tell about childhood that everyone will be familiar with.<br/><br/>This sounds like an interesting character creation process that could work for another game - such as a fantasy game inspired by Kingdom Hearts (and many other Square RPGs fit the mold).  I think it might be good to just play Penny for inspiration, and then alter your system with insights you gain.<br/><br/>I played a D&amp;D game where it was understood we were all childhood friends. But that's about all we said about it. We created characters as normal, talked about concepts, and filled in our backstories as we played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer" title="Rubbermancer"><img alt="Rubbermancer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer">Rubbermancer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378514/#Comment_378514" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T14:17:20+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smooth method, I like it!  I have two tips for games to check out if you want to run with this and refine it.  The Flashback mechanic from 3:16, and the Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen.  The last one I define as chargen through reminiscence simply because you get more into your role and learn more about the character you're portraying by engaging in the play mechanic of weaving tall tales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
