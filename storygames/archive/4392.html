Whee!<br/><br/>So, if you've taken a creative writing class in college, or have taken one since, or just read <a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">Jim Butcher's LJ</a>, you'll have heard of scenes and sequels as basically two foundational units of a story. If you haven't, the above-linked LJ has an excellent summary of the two units - check out the second and third posts down. Basically, a scene is a unit of a story focusing specifically on conflict and the achievement of a goal. A sequel is a unit of a story focusing specifically on reacting to the outcomes of conflict and moving the story in a new direction.<br/><br/>So, when Obi-Wan tries to convince Luke to go with him, and Luke says no, that's a scene.<br/><br/>When Luke's foster parents get killed, Luke buries them, considers his options, and chooses to go with Obi-Wan then - that's a sequel. It's kind of a thin sequel, because action movies tend to skip a lot of the ruminating and move straight to whatever choice the character makes so we can get to another scene, but all the requisite elements are there.<br/><br/>Sequels are also the tool you're supposed to use to give emotional warmth, resonance, and sympathy (or its lack) to the characters - they're where you show how your characters are human. For example, the key to making a revenge story stick usually isn't how the character goes about getting revenge, it's why the character chooses revenge as an option over other options. The villain in an adventure story is usually realized through a series of sequels, either adding moral ambiguity by giving you insight into their motive, or furthering the villain's sociopathy by having them go to further extremes in carrying out a plot ("Wipe them out. All of them.").<br/><br/>I think that figuring out what to do with sequels, mechanically speaking, is key to teasing out a lot of the non-conflict landmarks Tony's talking about in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4315&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>. In my experience, what usually happens is the material that would normally constitute a sequel gets shunted into out-of-game dialogue between the players, to hasten progress toward the next scene. Keeping with the revenge story example above, the characters will get wronged in once scene, yammer about it, and the next thing you play is them sneaking around their target's house with guns. Effective for pacing, but it can ring hollow on a visceral level.<br/><br/>So, what I want to talk about here is how to use mechanics to encourage people to actually play out sequels, and what kind of game purposes a sequel can serve. If that ends up tying back into Tony's stuff about formulae, so much the better. <br/><br/>The closest thing I've seen to putting sequels on the map mechanically is Interlude actions in <i>Bliss Stage: Ignition Stage</i> - they don't quite go there specifically, because they focus on developing relationships between characters, and hence could either suggest a scene or sequel depending on how you play it out. But the mechanical incentive there is a powerful one - you do it partly because it allows you to re-allocate your game resources.<br/><br/>There's a lot of unexplored potential there. Like, I could see a game where playing out sequels allows you to change your stats around to optimize you for certain kinds of conflicts. So, if we're doing this revenge story, and a rival co-worker throws pictures of you having a torrid affair up on the public company servers, you might spend stat points in whatever conflict mechanism the game uses to mitigate the effects of that action in various ways - maybe you lose your job or don't, maybe some friends alienate you and some don't, whatever.<br/><br/>Then, you play out the sequel, where you go confide in a friend, go home and hit things, reason out your options, ponder potential consequences, and decide how to proceed. You'd then get those points back in whatever stats you wanted. So your accountant may have spent points from Unassuming and Genial, but when you decide to go hardcore on this co-worker, you put them into Mad as Hell and My Shiny Gun. So whenever you want to "charge up" your character for a certain course of action, you do the sequel to set them up with the resources to do so.<br/><br/>Just one idea, among many. What do you folks think? Got any other ideas on how to bring this to the forefront of play more?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99074/#Comment_99074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T15:42:00+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  3:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflicts in my Pentasystem have a side effect of building up a certain number of consequences which need to be dealt with subsequently.

(At the moment I have a thing called "personal scenes" which are used when you change your character in some way.)<br/><br/>Think of a Dogs game where you have fallout after your conflict. As Lenny says, you tend to handle this in out-of-game dialogue. "OK, I'll drop Angry At Everything from d10 to d8, and add a d4 for We All Screw Up Sometimes." I like the idea of actually playing this out in action and dialogue.<br/><br/>"Jeb, I've realized that I've been angry at everything for a long time, and I want to change that..." (Picks up d10, theatrically swaps out for d8, writes on character sheet.)<br/><br/>And so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99079/#Comment_99079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T16:08:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  4:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 4:10PM by Burr.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually, the first thing that happens in a sequel is the emotional punch to the previous scene's protagonist.

I'll admit some bias here, because I pretty much sit in Author/Director stance all the time these days. And actually, the previous scene's protagonist doesn't have to be the POV character for a sequel - look at any fiction or film where the hero pulls off something cool, and the very next thing that happens is the villain hearing about it and going, "He did WHAT??!!" But that gets into a whole other set of sequencing issues, so I'll stay away from that for now.<br/><br/>To address your point, though, perhaps part of the key in preserving immersion here is that you just flow right into roleplaying the sequel without an obvious break, and don't mess with any of the mechanical stuff until it's over - sort of like you said, set a ritual moment aside where you step out and go, "Okay, so how do you guys think I should allocate this fallout now?" So when you do scene framing, however you do it, you're going in with the expectation that you're really looking at a scene-sequel pair, and make sure you stay out of the way, metagame-wise, until you've dealt with both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99108/#Comment_99108" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T20:09:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  8:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 8:10PM by Andy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to derail, but I totally, Totally had a "This is how it played out in a Role Playing Game" moment.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>So, when Obi-Wan tries to convince Luke to go with him, and Luke says no, that's a scene.</blockquote>\nGM: Obi-Wan says to come with him and fulfill your destiny.<br/>Andy: I dunno.

I like the idea of the sequal being a chance for the character to change, to gear up for the coming conflict.  Simply "spending XP" would be a simple way of doing this, but, as you've shown, there are cool things you can do with it as well.  I like the idea of being able to call on relationships in sequals, for mechanical benefit.  That's especially relevant for the kind of sequal in which your character isn't present.  Narrating a scene in which your character's wife hears about the savage beating your character just recieved, as an introduction to a scene where your character takes brutal revenge, would be cool.  <br/><br/>I think this would work especially well in games with <i>Trollbabe</i>-esque stats, which can slide up and down without increasing the power of the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99139/#Comment_99139" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T23:50:34+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

But I see it as "the stuff that happened after the conflict roll". Basically, at some point there was a conflict, and a resolution... but it's not like we called "scene!" there (but I have done it in "fast" games and demos in the past, so I totally know where you're coming from). Rather, we continued on, roleplaying, talking in character, above and beyond the "what happens immediately after the roll" parts. Sometimes we had followup scenes to show what happened next, totally without conflict, completely roleplaying in character until it naturally came to a close. <br/><br/>But note, that last scene I just mentioned is NOT a mechanic of WGP: In fact, it doesn't mention it. We were, <b>in fact</b>, breaking the rules a little by having scenes that were neither Conflict nor Enrichment scenes.

Ultimately, you have to form that connective tissue between conflicts, where the characters decide what the next conflict is going to be, or what they're going to try and do next, or whatever. It's hard to tell a story without any sequels in it at all - even in the most action-y stuff, you're going to get thin ones, like in <i>Big Trouble in Little China</i>: Jack dodges the car in the garage and watches it go, fuming. Then he says, with the kind of gravitas only Kurt Russell can bring, "Son of a bitch must pay." Cut to car chase.<br/><br/>Really, the playing out of sequels centers around a pacing concern, more often than not, because sequels slow down the action. So, genre plays a big part in that, as do the practical concerns of how much time you have left to play. Under those constraints, it's natural for sequels to sometimes get shunted to a quick out of character, "All right people, what now?"<br/><br/>The main reason why I bring it up is because a week ago, TonyLB said, "Conflicts are <b><i>very bad landmarks</i></b> for many kinds of stories." And I agree with him, and when I read that statement, I immediately thought, "Some of those landmarks can be found in sequels."<br/><br/>Take romances, for instance. There are whole romance stories that are hung on series of sequels in a row, interspersed with a smattering of scenes, because they place the emotional and reactionary content front and center. If they concentrated on scenes, all romance stories would be very short, because you'd get three different moments of trying and failing to communicate interest/compatibility, a fourth moment that succeeds, and then the kiss and whatever follows.<br/><br/>So the idea is, you're deliberately trying to tell a certain kind of story, and because you're doing that, it's accepted that more of your game time is going to be spent doing sequels than you usually get in adventure fiction.<br/><br/>So then, the question becomes, how do we make that worth your while from a mechanical standpoint?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99203/#Comment_99203" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T08:46:53+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  8:46AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lenny, this idea intrigues me. And makes me want to reread Jack Bickham's <i>Scene and Sequel</i> or whatever it's called. Which is good.<br/><br/>My initial reaction was to think back to D&amp;D, where classically the scene consists of beating things up, and the sequel consists of examining the loot and getting healed by the cleric. Only problem is that arguments over who gets the +3 sword and decisions about who to heal can quickly turn into a scene again. So... maybe the key is to have an aftermath to every conflict where the players can juggle some stats to their advantage while narrating their reaction to what has just happened. Something each can do alone without the need for interaction.

For the most part we've been playing <acronym title="The Shadow of Yesterday">TSOY</acronym> lately, so the first thing that comes to mind for me are Pool Refresh scenes.  These are supposed to be conflict-free moments in play, and they seem like a natural mechanical fit for Sequels.  <br/><br/>Last week, for example, my character had an emotionally brutal conflict with one of his friends, who was essentially trying to talk him out of his self-loathing depression.  By the end, my character had lost the conflict and was tapped out (Pools emptied, broken with Harm).  My immediate instinct was to look for a Pool Refresh, which ended up with my character turning to an NPC he'd been avoiding, seeking solace in her arms.  It was a small scene, but it reflected the change in his character resulting from the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99276/#Comment_99276" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T13:45:03+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  1:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, man, Steve beat me to the punch on TSoY and Pool Refreshes. I don't think I have much more to add, but I will point out that what would make it work to my mind is that Refresh scenes are always with <i>another character</i>. Which is probably obvious, but I wanted to spell it out. That would seem to be an important element to many kinds of sequels, whether a simple cry-in-your beer scene with a buddy, or more soap=opera interactions like Steve's example above.<br/><br/>It was Mike's discussion of Dogs Fallout that got this firing off in my brain.

And like in TSOY that Steve talks about, the refreshment type scenes in Agon function that way too.  Sequels can be used as followups from the aftermath of action--or they could be used to set you up for something in advance.   Outcomes of prequel scenes could be new traits etc. that let your character do things they could not before. Or just establish connections with other characters.  <br/><br/>Basically, whatever resources you want a character to have attached to them, could arise as the outcome of any scene in the game. Or narrative markers like flags could change and develop.  A focus on conflict just attaches us to a lot of thought about changes in character due to harm or increased effectiveness.  But, it could be anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99336/#Comment_99336" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T15:45:43+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm, we're getting close. All the proferred examples are good ones for suggesting <i>opportunities</i> to play out sequels, but I'm not sure that equates to <i>encouraging</i> sequels, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>And, one core thing that we're skipping is that a sequel always involves a choice on the part of a protagonist to move into what's going to be the next scene, and all the resonance that entails. Choice is a big deal, even when conflict is not.<br/><br/>So, let's look at MikeRM's example, way up in the thread:\n<blockquote>Think of a Dogs game where you have fallout after your conflict. As Lenny says, you tend to handle this in out-of-game dialogue. "OK, I'll drop Angry At Everything from d10 to d8, and add a d4 for We All Screw Up Sometimes." I like the idea of actually playing this out in action and dialogue.</blockquote>\nLet's expand this and say that the conflict was about talking someone out of suicide. Let's say the Dog in question gave on this conflict, because his angry, judgmental posture ended up aggravating the NPCs desire for suicide, and his dice were low, and it goes down as being very ambiguous whether or not the Dog actually helped the process along.<br/><br/>So, we do a followup, where the Dog is wrestling with this, and there's fallout to assign. So the Dog talks it out with another character, and that roleplay reveals the apt choices for fallout: Drop a die size in Angry at Everything, and add a d4 for We All Screw Up Sometimes.<br/><br/>So, far, we don't have a full sequel yet. A full sequel is when, after mulling all that over, the Dog looks at the other character and says, "I have to tell his wife what happened. I owe her that much. If I'm gonna say I'm responsible for someone's life, I got to be responsible for the consequences, too. It's the King's will."<br/><br/>And everyone at the table goes, "Oh, shit."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99342/#Comment_99342" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T16:17:47+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  4:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which is the lead-on to the next action.

It was similar to King's Quest, Maniac Mansion, etc., but with a little action thrown in now and then.<br/><br/>There's a part in the beginning of the game where Jones is stuck in his office. He's trying to figure out what to do about a mob of students outside who want their final grades or something.  And if I remember correctly, he's just received his father's diary.  For him to figure out what to do next, you have to click on various artifacts lying around his office to see what there is he can use. (Eventually, he crawls out of a window.)  When you click on an artifact, Jones reminisces a bit about it. Even when the object itself is useless, what he says is generally humorous enough to be worthwhile.<br/><br/>Now you're probably realizing the same thing I did.  He was in a sequel, and it was interactive and <i>fun</i>.<br/><br/>The whole time, he talks to you "through the camera," as if you were just another friendly character in the room. So pretend that you are, in fact, another PC inside the office with Jones.  Because the sequel is a puzzle, not  simply exposition, it is a chance for you to explore the character of Jones and the general atmosphere while advancing the story in a meaningful way.  You <i>want</i> to experience the sequel of another character because a) it provides you the information you need to solve the puzzle, and b) the interaction can be fun in its own right.<br/><br/>So... how can this be turned into a general storygame mechanic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
