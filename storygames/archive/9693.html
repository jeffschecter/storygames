Given its position at the heart of the model, it seems imperative to me to get a wide spread of data about CA (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Big_Model.svg" rel="nofollow">a picture of the BM</a>)<br/><br/>In this regard, I'm thinking of doing a survery of gamers at Gen Con (if I can't get permission from GC, I'll just do it for the indy gamers at the Embassy Suites).<br/><br/>My first instinct is to provide gamers with a pad with three columns, G, N and S into which they can put a mark every time during a game they think they're creative agenda falls into one of the three categories. I'd have some useful reminders of what G, N and S mean such as winning, addressing story, addressing setting.<br/><br/>Some people have suggested this might be problematic but haven't yet suggested anything I could do instead. So I'm going to stick with the three columns and <b>I'd like storygamers to either:<br/>- suggest how to label the columns; or <br/>- suggest a better way of doing this survey.</b><br/><br/>I'm not interested in opinions as to whether this is a waste of time or not appropriate. Take those ideas to your own thread.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215301/#Comment_215301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T08:01:17+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  8:01AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... could you focus your survey on specific, popular games, and give the players some commonly modeled benchmarks to look for in the game? I'd rely on that sort of survey much better than one based on personal interpretation of words usually used to describe GNS. For example, you could poll just players of D&amp;D 4th edition or something, and ask them about the amount of game-like optimization encountered in lieu of exploring the fiction; that's something a person might even be able to recognize.<br/><br/>Another thing I'd consider would be polling about complete sessions instead of free moments of play, because GNS has nothing to do with the latter. The way you're doing it, you're not actually polling for CA - you're polling for techniques of play. "I engaged the rules system, oh boy do I feel gamist right now." is pretty much the most common misunderstanding of the model out there, I don't know how much use polling for that misunderstanding would be.<br/><br/>However, the best surveying method in this case, I think, would be to have a person who knows how to recognize CA follow on a number of tables and identify their CA in rough terms. You could limit the observation to 15 minutes per table and have the surveyor make a call at each - either G, N, S, incoherent or unrecognizable. This would require the surveyor to be highly familiar with GNS and a big number of different games and approaches so he could recognize the likely direction of a group's interaction, and it would be easy to make mistakes if the surveyor had faults in this regard, but I still think that you'd likely get more reliable results than you'd get with self-identification done by the players themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215352/#Comment_215352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:19:53+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:19AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes x1000 to Eero. Just self-identification will be worse than useless to finding out what CAs arise in groups, since you might interpret your survey results as that instead of what people self-identify as playing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's my proposal for crowdsourcing:<br/><br/>a) Find a surveyor (The Surveyor) as Eero describes, with the additional qualification that she be trusted not to screw with the following incentive structure and she be trusted by others to do a decent job at classifying play. Her job is to do precisely as Eero described: 5 categories of play, G, N, S, coherent-but-more-likely-unrecognized-than-G,N,orS, and incoherent.<br/><br/>b) Print up a whole bunch of forms that other people can take around, fill in, and return to you. These give guidance (15 minutes, G, N, S, U, I), directions (go classify at least 5 groups (unnecessary?)), and the prize structure.<br/><br/>c) Have a prize! The structure is: positive points for classifying any group The Surveyor didn't get to (but which you know was definitely a group? needs thought). Small negative points for classifying a group differently than The Surveyor. Large positive points for classifying a group the same way The Surveyor did. Hm... probably some more points for each group classified inversely proportional to the total number of people who classified that group. Every N points gets you a raffle ticket or whatnot.<br/><br/>d) Logistic regression for the win. There are many ways to set up the model - your best bet is to make a post asking for a volunteer who knows what she's doing. One off-the-cuff example: give each group 4 free variables in 5 parameters that add up to 1, the probability over any given short observation period that the group should be classified as either G, N, S, U, or I. Give each respondent 20 free variables in 25 parameters, 5 groups of "given play was G, probability of identifying play as G,N,S,U,I" each. Make your own priors, update them based on aggregate performance, fit the variables, and viola - the best data you're gonna be able to get about the CA of people playing at Gen Con when they might know other people are classifying them (woooo confounders!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215363/#Comment_215363" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:40:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He, I like making it a competition.

I'm not sure what unrecognizable means, or how you'd recognise it).<br/><br/>I do love the idea of white coats and it would be a sure fire way of enhancing any game of Paranoia or Trail of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
