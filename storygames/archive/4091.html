You might find the discussion there interesting.</i><br/><br/><i>Right now, right this moment, right as you read these words, humanity is devastated by an alien attack from the edges of our understanding.</i><br/><br/><b>Introduction</b><br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been really curious about <i>Bliss Stage</i> ever since I heard about it a couple of years ago.  I admit that it was something of a dark curiosity.  On the one hand, I have a long-time fanboy appreciation for mecha.  My first game was a mecha wargame, and my favorite bits about Games Workshop\xe2\u20ac\u2122s EPIC game was its mechs.  So a game about mechs formed from relationships, piloted by angsty teens, seemed right up my alley.  Add to this the fact that <i>Bliss Stage</i> was written by Ben Lehman, the author of <i>Polaris</i>, and I was ready to buy.  On the other hand, though, I was concerned that the stories would necessarily degenerate into sexually vile territory.  The idea that combat power comes from intimacy, which is best boosted by having sex, seemed disturbing.  So I remained uncertain.<br/><br/>Then I heard about the mission mechanic (which I will discuss below), and I was pushed over the edge.  So, when Ben announced that there were only a few more preorder slots available, I threw down my cash and bought in.<br/><br/>I do not regret it.<br/><br/>I know that <i>Bliss Stage</i> has been getting a lot of love around the Net, but now, the World\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Biggest Polaris Fanboy is bringing his power to bear on <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  So, suit up, strap in, and hold on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91342/#Comment_91342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T10:48:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 10:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \xe2\u20ac\xa6incoming transmission \xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Peoria Resistance Group\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/><i>Bliss Stage makes me think of <a href="\xe2\u20ac\x9d" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</i><br/><br/><b>We are the resistance</b><br/><br/>Last Saturday (8/25/2007), we sat down to play <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  Here are the players:<br/><br/>Seth\xe2\u20ac\u201dThat\xe2\u20ac\u2122s me.  As I mentioned above, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m a big fan of <i>Polaris</i>, I like mechs, I like tragedy, and I like mind-bending settings.  That puts me squarely in the target market for this game.<br/><br/>Crystal\xe2\u20ac\u201dThis is my wife.  She likes immersive games that focus on relationships.  Mechs don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really move her, although they aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t a turn-off either.  She did watch <i>Evangelion</i> with me, and she liked it.  And she loves me, so she was willing to give <i>Bliss Stage</i> a whirl.<br/><br/>Gabrielle\xe2\u20ac\u201dThis is my sister, who lives with us.  Gabrielle has had some exposure to the mech genre, especially while she was helping me demo my own mecha game.  More importantly, she has seen all the <i>Matrix</i> movies, so the dream world mech concept clicked fairly easily with her.  Plus, she is also a Ben Lehman fan, so she was interested in the game.<br/><br/>By mutual consent, I was appointed to be the GM.  We even had a brief conversation about how long it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been since we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve played a roleplaying game with a GM.  (About two years, if I recall correctly.)  I read the \xe2\u20ac\u0153Seven Years\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153The ANIMa\xe2\u20ac\x9d sections of the book to them, and then we started brainstorming.<br/><br/>Of late, it seems like all my roleplaying is happening in Peoria, where I live.  <i>Dirty Secrets</i> must be set in the players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 home town, my recent game of <i>Breaking the Ice</i> was set in Peoria, and now <i>Bliss Stage</i> is in the ruins of Peoria, seven years from now.<br/><br/>Ah, the many sides of Peoria.<br/><br/>Anyways, we finally hashed out our resistance cell.  They are headquartered in downtown Peoria, where they have dug tunnels connecting the basements of the different buildings together.  Not only are they threatened by the aliens, but they must also fend off the Bigelow Boys, a real-life Peoria gang that has only become nastier in the seven years since the attack.  Also, at age 15, everyone in the group starts doing drugs in an attempt to stave off the Bliss.  So far, we don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know if it will actually work for anyone other than Jared.  Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hoping.<br/><br/>Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s our Dramatis Personae:<br/><br/><i>Primary Figures</i><br/><br/>Jared\xe2\u20ac\u201dour authority figure.  Age 27, stays high to stay awake.  Once he was a white trash stoner, but now he actually has a purpose.  Sadly, if he gives up his drugs, he gives up the fight.<br/><br/>Marcus\xe2\u20ac\u201dGabrielle\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pilot.  Age 17.  Devoted Lover.  Marcus is a family man.  At least, as much of a family man as you can be at 17.  He is married to Beth, and they have a daughter named Renee.  They love each other but their relationship is immature.<br/><br/>Jude\xe2\u20ac\u201dCrystal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pilot.  Age 13.  Carefree Hedonist.  Jude is an ex-Bigelow Boy who finally split with the gang after betraying them to rescue the resistance cell.  Now he pilots the group\xe2\u20ac\u2122s second ANIMa.  However, he is not integrating well into the group, as he constantly slips away into the ruins to visit Rachel, a whore that he holed up with a while back.  He respects Leah far too much to make a move on her.<br/><br/>Leah\xe2\u20ac\u201dGabrielle\xe2\u20ac\u2122s anchor.  Age 13.  Mousy and studious.  Very nervous.  Has a crush on Jude but is too embarrassed to admit it.<br/><br/>Beth\xe2\u20ac\u201dCrystal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s anchor.  Age 15.  Usually anchors for Marcus.  Punchy and violent at times, yet deeply in love with Marcus.<br/><br/><i>Secondary Characters</i><br/><br/>Joseph\xe2\u20ac\u201dChief Scout for the group.  Age 13.  Owns a pack of vicious dogs and a Big Ol\xe2\u20ac\u2122 Knife.  Cold and dangerous.  Now married to Gloria after rescuing her from being raped by the Bigelow Boys.  Why yes, Jude <i>was</i> nearby when this happened.  Why do you ask?<br/><br/>Gloria\xe2\u20ac\u201dno specified role yet.  Mother of Nathaniel as a result of her rape.  Married to Joseph.  (Also, proof of Ron\xe2\u20ac\u2122s assertion <a href="denied:\xe2\u20ac\x9dhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24600.msg239267#msg239267\xe2\u20ac\x9d" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>Rachel\xe2\u20ac\u201dwhore in the wastes.  Age 13.  Not part of the resistance group, but Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s current thing.<br/><br/>Eve\xe2\u20ac\u201dresistance group\xe2\u20ac\u2122s manager and everyone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u0153mother\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Age 17.  Married to Jared.  Pregnant.  She <i>should</i> give birth before her eighteenth birthday, so maybe she can get on the drugs so the Bliss won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get her.<br/><br/><i>The Kids</i><br/><br/>Kay\xe2\u20ac\u201dAge 7.  Was the child of Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s neighbor.  Now Jared and Eve are taking care of her.  She cares for the two little ones of the community.<br/><br/>Nathaniel\xe2\u20ac\u201dAge 2.  Gloria\xe2\u20ac\u2122s son.  Adopted by Joseph.  Precocious.<br/><br/>Renee\xe2\u20ac\u201dAge 4 months.  Daughter of Marcus and Beth.<br/><br/>And last, but certainly not least, our Hope:<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153We hope that we can establish a stable community.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/><br/><b>Some thoughts on creating your resistance group</b><br/><br/>So, did you follow all that?  If you did, then you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re a better person than me.  We took somewhere between two and three hours to put all that together, which was somewhat surprising to me.  This isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t a bad thing, mind you.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s just a matter of expectations.  I had hoped to run through the first mission that evening, but by the end of creating our resistance group, we were all tired and ready to call it quits for the evening.<br/><br/>The quantity of characters can be a little overwhelming, too.  I know that we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve pretty much created all the characters that we will use for the game, but still, pulling out that stack of index cards and flipping through it can be quite the experience.<br/><br/>Also, I found that the pace of the game slowed down sharply when we actually created pilots.  Before then, everything was snappy.  Then, when the players were working on assigning relationships, the energy level dropped.  I think that this is because we only have one copy of the book, so only one player could work on his relationships at a time.  Also, there was a lot of referring to the character cards, trying to remember who all we had invented, and this slowed things down, too.  So, something to be aware of.  In the future, it might be good to scrawl down a character relationship worksheet for each player to use when creating a pilot.  Afterwards, the information could be transcribed onto the character cards.<br/><br/><b>Reflections on the game</b><br/><br/>At a certain point during prep, Crystal cited this Scripture verse:  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Yet she will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  (1 Timothy 2:15)  As we were forming our community, we realized that a major factor was the need to bear more children.  Otherwise, there wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be anyone left to consolidate the gains that we made, even if our ANIMa were victorious over the aliens.  I think that this is going to be a running theme of our game.  Our ability to resolve our hope in any positive sense is going to have to include the foundation of families in a protected environment.<br/><br/>Also, it will be interesting to see how relationships with the children morph over time.  We also have a couple different \xe2\u20ac\u0153origins\xe2\u20ac\x9d of the children.  Renee is born to a married couple, while Nathaniel is the result of a rape.  He has been adopted, to be sure, but still, I wonder how much his parentage will be an issue in this fragile community.<br/><br/>Jude is also big trouble.  While he is a pilot and therefore important, he hasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really integrated with the goals and philosophies of the group.  That will be a problem.<br/><br/>Next up, our first session of gameplay.<br/><br/>But for now, this is Seth Ben-Ezra, of the Peoria Resistance Group, signing off.<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa6end transmission\xe2\u20ac\xa6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91366/#Comment_91366" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:04:25+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth: Where do you want responses?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91389/#Comment_91389" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:33:45+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's go with the Forge for serious stuff, and here for "Way cool!" and "You're a moron!" and stuff like that.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95088/#Comment_95088" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:19:11+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \xe2\u20ac\xa6incoming transmission \xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Peoria Resistance Group\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Bliss Stage makes me think of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqUb3L1IRYA" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOn 8/27/2007, Crystal, Gabrielle, and I sat down to play our first session of <i>Bliss Stage.</i>  Things start off with a bang, so suit up, strap in, and hold on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scramble!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like doing game prep, so I already like <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  Yes, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the need to put together missions, which I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll discuss a bit below.  But the opening of the game is scripted.  You start with a mission briefing.  Aliens are attacking the base.  They must be stopped!  If not, one of the characters will be Harmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool.  And very helpful. The opening mission serves as a simple tutorial on running mission actions, which require a bit of understanding to grasp, plus it immediately destabilizes the opening situation.  I love it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nScramble!<br/>\nPrevent alien from reaching base<br/>\nDefeat enemy pilot<br/>\nIf either is failed, one non-pilot character is harmed (GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choice)<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, two alien remotes were attacking our base in downtown Peoria.  One was coming from the north, near St. Francis Medical Center, and the other from the south, across the river.  As a bonus, here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=311+Main+St,+peoria,+IL&amp;sll=40.69215,-89.58779&amp;sspn=0.098139,0.22934&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.691898,-89.589686&amp;spn=0.024535,0.057335&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" rel="nofollow">map</a> of the area in question.  The pointer shows where our headquarters are located.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided that remotes have an overlap in the dream world and the real world.  So they can be engaged as dream entities and destroyed.  So, the pilots scrambled to their ANIMa cr\xc3\xa8ches.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agreed that, in the anime of our game, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a standard montage of launching the ANIMas.  We also agreed that we need to have \xe2\u20ac\u0153start the mission!\xe2\u20ac\x9d music or something.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve located a MIDI of the \xe2\u20ac\u0153Angel Attack\xe2\u20ac\x9d theme from Evangelion, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m open to suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ran both missions separately. Jude went south, across the Bob Michel bridge, and was able to engage and destroy the remote at that location.  Marcus went north towards OSF and easily destroyed the remote at that location.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a rules error for these missions.  I missed the fact that I always narrate for the aliens.  I thought that I could only contribute narration if pilot safety was threatened as the result of a mission roll.  This led to a bit of confusion for Crystal, who was trying to get into character as an anchor, yet provide adversity at the same time.  Once we ironed this out in future actions, the process was much smoother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we were still hashing out the look-and-feel of the ANIMas.  We\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve finally settled on rounded, organic shapes, instead of blocky, armored shapes.  So, closer to <i>Evangelion</i> than <i>Battletech</i>.  We also discovered that Crystal didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have nearly the level of exposure to the mech concept as Gabrielle and I did.  But, after some encouragement, she managed to come up with some cool gear for her ANIMa.  And, as a bonus, she has been tying her equipment to the relationship thematically. So, Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Rachel is a sensor jammer, and his relationship with Gloria is a cancer gun.  Yeah, it fires projectiles that metastasize upon hitting the target, burrowing in all directions.  Nasty!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>On the Home Front</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the mission, we jumped to interlude actions.  I explained to Crystal and Gabrielle that this is the basic pattern of the game.  Actually, I think the quote went like this:  \xe2\u20ac\u0153In mission actions, we fight the aliens.  Then, in interlude actions, we whine about how nobody understands how hard it is.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  We all got a good laugh out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after the mission, Jude and Leah had a brief interlude.  Leah had been forced to use the panic button to get Jude out of the dream world, since she was beginning to lose control.  She was really upset by this and hurried over to help Jude out of the tank, clean the goo off him, and the like.  They never actually made eye contact, though, both being very embarrassed by the sudden close proximity.  Then Jude made an excuse and bolted for the door.  Off to see Rachel.  I called it an Intimacy Building scene, because of their physical contact and working together on a shared project (cleaning up Jude).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus and Beth had their own interlude.  Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the background.  Their relationship had picked up some stress during the battle, and they had had a brief debate about Beth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s using the panic button to get Marcus out of the dream world.  Marcus convinced her to let him wake up naturally, which had been disappointing to Beth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as their interlude, they were having a picnic dinner on top of one of the tall buildings downtown, watching the sunset.  At this point, Marcus brings up the panic button again, asking Beth if she would please refrain from using it if it isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t necessary.  This turned into a big fight, as Beth started blaming Marcus for abandoning her with Renee at night.  Beth claimed that she was doing all the work of raising their child, especially at night, when Marcus doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t wake up to take care of the baby.  So yeah, if she can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t wake him up at night, then at least she\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll get the pleasure of jolting him out of \xe2\u20ac\u0153sleep\xe2\u20ac\x9d at the end of a mission.  Beth was really fierce and emotional during this fight; she even started crying at one point.  Marcus fumbled around a bit and eventually settled on trying to placate Beth, saying that he would stay up with the baby that night.  I called this Stress Relief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95089/#Comment_95089" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:19:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dawn Patrol</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus did his best.  But, early the next day, Jared knocked on the door.  Someone needed to do a perimeter sweep, and Jude had gone missing.  Marcus tried to avoid waking up Beth, but she got up herself and insisted on anchoring for the mission.  So they left the baby with Kay and went to the ANIMa cr\xc3\xa8che to launch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn Patrol<br/>\nSecure base perimeter<br/>\nScout out local region<br/>\nIf failed, prevent alien pilot from escaping<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mission didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go quite as smoothly as the first.  Maybe she was tired, but Beth wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t doing as good a job of keeping control of the dream.  A nasty rain of steel droplets started falling from the sky, and Beth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s communications with Marcus were uneven and static-filled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter fulfilling the second mission objective, Marcus discovered a large pulsating alien hive atop the ridge line overlooking the base.  So he hotshotted a goal:  Destroy alien hive.  Thankfully, this succeeded, although I managed to squick out my players with my description of alien goo flying everywhere, including onto the ANIMa, where it started melting pieces of equipment and such, thus justifying some of the battle damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tensions Relieved and Heightened</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBack to interludes.  Marcus and Beth had a quick interlude immediately after mission, hugging and holding each other.  I called this Stress Relief, too.  This was good, because they were on the verge of losing a point of Trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I called for an interlude.  Jude is coming back into base from visiting Rachel, when Joseph confronts him.  I actually have ownership of Joseph, which meant that Gabrielle was Judge for the interlude.  This was cool; I had thought that I would end up being Judge all the time and was glad to have been wrong about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like the Bigelow Boys, so he doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t trust Jude.  Now, with Jude coming back from who-knows-where, Joseph tries to put the fear into him.  Nothing quite like a big ol\xe2\u20ac\u2122 knife to scare someone.  Joseph even used it to scratch Jude on the arm, right where his Bigelow Boys\xe2\u20ac\u2122 tattoo is.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabrielle called it Intimacy Building.  Funny, but true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Some thoughts on missions</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe <i>Bliss Stage</i> mission system is really cool.  There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s immersion in spades, if you like that kind of thing, but there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s also an appropriate amount of strategy, too.  <i>Bliss Stage</i> makes mechanized combat narrative without losing actual tactical concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know, essentially the anchor and pilot talk to each other in character for the entire mission.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a combination of the Operator from The Matrix and the radio chatter between an armored vehicle and base.  It was a little tricky at first, but we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re getting the hang of it.  Give us another session, and it will probably be second nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started doing other things to help us get into the moment.  First, we laid out the various character cards in the shape of a mech, putting the pilot at the head, the anchor as the body, and the other characters in the appropriate locations for their equipment.  So, Crystal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s head-mounted cancer gun went above her pilot.  Gabrielle\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Really Big Gun was mounted on her mech\xe2\u20ac\u2122s left hand, so the card went on the left.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while Crystal was anchoring, she actually picked up an old keyboard and set it on the table in front of her.  Then, as she ran control work, she could type on the keyboard and gesture at various imaginary displays in front of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a tactical perspective, I appreciated how you want to power up your mech by getting the <i>right amount</i> of dice.  Unused dice mostly turn into Bliss, so you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want too many of them around.  However, you do want enough positive dice to put into your various mission categories.  But then, each piece you add to your mech becomes another piece that you have to defend.  And, of course, \xe2\u20ac\u01530\xe2\u20ac\x9d results on unused dice don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t turn into Bliss, so maybe it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s better to put the \xe2\u20ac\u0153-\xe2\u20ac\u0153 dice into battle damage to your mech instead of Bliss for your pilot\xe2\u20ac\xa6.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s trauma.  As your pilot becomes more injured, the GM gets to pick mission categories to threaten, making them harder to win.  The player has to assign two dice to a category, and then take the lower result.  This just makes a bad situation worse.  There are other nasty things that you can do with trauma, but I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t had the chance to try them out\xe2\u20ac\xa6yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a big thumbs up on the mission rules, Ben!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Some thoughts on being the GM</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOver <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24623.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, there was some discussion of what it means to be the GM in <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  I was planning on writing a little about that, so here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my take on being GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, being a GM in this game isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really much different from being a player.  I even get my own special character.  The players get pilots; I get an authority figure.  (As an aside, I loved the rule about a player being able to assume the GM role by having his pilot become the new authority figure.)  So, in some ways, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t do much different from the other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept one thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, in <i>Bliss Stage</i>, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my job to be the War.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what I mean.  Interludes are all about the various characters dealing with their issues.  However, they are all part of this war, and that means that they have to do things that they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like doing or don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to do.  I think that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my job to increase that stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis shows up in two ways.  First, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m laying out missions with no real care for what the future holds for our characters.  I figure that we will simply do them in the order that I prep them.  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the force of Necessity.  These things Must Be Done.  If you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t deal with it, well, then that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s really just too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if I can take advantage of the characters\xe2\u20ac\u2122 situation somehow and use a mission to exacerbate it, well, so much the better.  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what I did with Dawn Patrol.  Originally, I went with that title because it seemed evocative.  However, after Marcus and Beth had their fight, I <i>had</i> to force that mission on Marcus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure that playing the authority figure is similar.  He needs to be the advocate of what is Necessary and demand it of the characters.  How they react is up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, after all, isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t accepting the Necessary part of growing up?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Reflections on the game</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI talked a lot about mission actions, but Gabrielle had a moment of realization in an interlude that I wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus is Gabrielle\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pilot, so she got to play his side of the Marcus/Beth argument.  Crystal didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go easy, either, as she fully played up the emotional, irrational woman role.  (She fully acknowledges that she has played this role in real life from time to time.)  Marcus wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t just floundering; <i>Gabrielle</i> was floundering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up talking about this a little after the game, with Gabrielle having a little more sympathy for men.  But also, she said that the incident made her realize that she doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know how to deal with emotional people at all.  It was a moment of self-awareness prompted by the game, so I thought that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d share.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for now, this is Seth Ben-Ezra, of the Peoria Resistance Group, signing off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
