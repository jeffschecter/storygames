I play this over a chatroom from San Fran with two college students from the Cambridge area, one of whom attends Cambridge University.<br/><br/>The players and thier relevant characters:<br/><br/>* SoylentWhite (who is made of win) plays, among others, pilot Lloyd Frey, an extremely ruthless Seasoned Veteran who has repeatedly demonstrated that he's willing to do whatever he deems needed to win the war - including threaten to rip the balls off of the base mechanic if he didn't date the other pilot, a <i>thirteen year old</i> Innocent Sweetheart, in a misguided attempt to make her ANIMa more powerful.<br/><br/>* ChessyPig plays Alice Robinson, Lloyd's Anchor, who is likewise cynical and became <i>Driven</i> ever since the first pilot of the war, her elder sister Rachael, was killed in battle.  She only has demonstrated softening up her brittle exterior in the presence of Lloyd, and nearly broke up (before the game began) with him over...<br/><br/>* Amanda, my character during these Interludes.  Base's cook, <i>extremely</i> prickly, scares the shit out of the Innocent Sweetheart, who was caught making out with Lloyd by Miss Robinson.<br/><br/>We had established early on that the characters had a limited understanding of the intimacy and trust rules... at least, they knew as much in-character as would make sense after a year testing the capabilities and limits of the ANIMa.<br/><br/>Now, with this set-up, I knew - KNEW - that I wanted Amanda to be open to the idea of a triad ( by extension of "a couple"): both for dramatic reasons and to see how badly this jarred with the players idea of right and wrong.  (Soy and I also both assumed that ChessyPig and therefore Alice would be violently opposed to the idea.)  I also knew that Amanda would feel extremely offended at Lloyd's additude of dispassionately trying to get a  <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5" rel="nofollow">Level-up at Intimacy 5</a> for himself and the other pilot for the sake of sheer survival.  She was fine, in other words with him also going out with Alice:  NOT with him going out with him simply because he wanted a higher-caliber autocannon.<br/><br/>So then.  Lloyd came into the kitchen after dinner for a glass of water, and Amanda intercepted him, saying that they needed to talk.  Water secured, they made small talk in the cafeteria:  Amanda turned a comment about her being prickly (Lloyd: "You scare people off, and most people won't care enough to look below the surface."  Amanda: "I figured that you seperate the wheat from the chaff by <i>bludgeoning</i> it,") into the beginning of a long string of innuendoes:<br/><br/>"I certainly seem to rub some people up the wrong way, I'll give you that."<br/>"And Alice the RIGHT way, apparently." <br/>"It's a talent. Want me to show you?"<br/>"Dear me, does Alice know?" <br/>"Oh, she KNOWS how I rub her, alright."<br/>"I could stand some lessons, assuming that this won't result in our murder." <br/>"Understand, my lessons are heavily subscribed, but for a favoured customer, I could fit you in a few days after you stop hearing Alice scream at me. She's due to begin shortly after I next meet with her." <br/><br/>...finally broken by Amanda asking, in an unexpectedly sober tone, "...I wonder what would happen if we outright <b>asked?</b>" <br/><br/>Lloyd admitted that he was intending to do this, but didn't want to get Amanda involved until he knew that Alice wouldn't murderlyze the both of them.  Amanda, sighing, said that the last thing she wanted was for Alice to get hurt in the process. <br/><br/>Lloyd replied, "I cannot let <i>any</i> feelings, even those I have for her, let me place all of you at risk."<br/><br/>Amanda agreed, noting that "Firepower doesn't count for everthing... armor comes in handy too." <br/><br/>"I don't want to hurt anyone. Not you, not Alice. But I *need* both of you." <br/><br/>"Presumably for reasons other than an arms race," she muttered. <br/><br/>Soylent says that this was the point where he realized that Lloyd honestly had feelings for Amanda, rather than him leading Amanda on for survivals sake... and had Lloyd find himself saying:  "...It doesn't work like that. False emotions are useless. Your manifestation is so powerful <i>because</i> my feelings for you are so strong." <br/><br/>Amanda nodded.  "I know."<br/><br/>We wrapped up that interlude soon after, with some comments about the surprising (to Lloyd) lack of jealousy on Amanda's part.<br/><br/>Chessy rendered judgement:  She wished - desperately wished - that the relationship didn't have any Stress at the time, because as she put it "this is the definition of Trust Building."  We toyed with Stress Relief for a while, but eventually we figured that Lloyd finally being honest with himself erased his last point of Trauma.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed how this played out.  Soylent was rather shocked at Lloyd's sudden upswing in humanity, and so was I.  I mused out loud that maybe they WERE actually, honestly, in love.<br/><br/>Next post: Alice by Lloyd.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
