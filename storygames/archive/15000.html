So, as I mentioned in my intro, I have been writing an RPG for awhile now. Its honestly going over 15 years. Now, that IS a bit crazy, but its been an ongoing, evolving project. It started out using other peoples rules and adding bits and pieces from a myriad of different games. I am on the third (possibly fourth, its hard to keep track) version of the system, each looking less like the one preceding it. It is a skill based game. No classes or levels. It is built around a d10 core that is modified by attributes and uses opposed rolls. Its still very much in the testing phase. I am working on making it presentable for people outside of my group. I call the system "Multiversal". SERIOUSLY hoping that name is not yet taken! Anyway, I have rough files on Google Docs, but, as I said, they are UGLY and very much WIP.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the setting...well, that is where I have done a LOT of solid work in the last few years. What started as a generic fantasy setting has slowly evolved into a post-apocalyptic fantasy world with a bit of Revelations for the overarching plot. The apocalypse happened due to a cabal of dark mages working to cause a nuclear war. Things spun out of control and the entire world was thrown into chaos and the four seals began to break lose and with them, magic returned to Earth. After the third seal opened, the three riders stood facing the gate, awaiting the opening of the fourth seal. The lamb said unto them "Look." and they turned and beheld their fourth brother, Death, in a mortal guise upon his pale horse. Around him was not Hell, but the kingdom of man, wreathed in steel and steam, lightning, thunder and fury. The three were beaten down and spread to the winds, never to be seen in their immortal face again. Now, each of them has taken mortal form and formed their own kingdoms, the three trying to destroy man to bring Hell to earth, but Death resists them, siding with humanity, spreading his word of resistance so that man may beat back the forces of hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the BIG plot. Their are lots of little things I have written as well, such as the Reborn which are undead who are reanimated by unknown forces but still have their souls. Something about "when their is no more room in hell..." and all that. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed this teaser.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341090/#Comment_341090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T13:09:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  1:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does a character do in this game?<br/><br/>After googling a bit, I found a "<a href="http://www.multiverser.org/multiverser/" rel="nofollow">Multiverser</a>" RPG, but no "Multiversal", if it matters to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KaneBlaireau" title="KaneBlaireau"><img alt="KaneBlaireau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KaneBlaireau">KaneBlaireau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341103/#Comment_341103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T14:24:56+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  2:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Characters will generally be playing "heroes".

Their are several factions that work for Death. Each of them is actively recruiting for their own brand of resistance. Each city, likewise, always needs help defending themselves from marauders as well as supernatural incursion and monsters. The "Holy Empire" as I call them has their own brand of hero who sends out groups of zealots and priests to forcibly convert anyone who does not follow the "One Faith". In their minds, they are heroes. To everyone in the surrounding villages, they are psychotic fanatics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I had a party that started as a trade caravan and its guard retinue as well as wanderers. They caravan was attacked, bringing the group closer together. When the caravan leader was killed and a party member took over, they finished the delivery and were sent on a mission to secure the trade routes so that the caravan could continue its route. This involved attacking the bandits at their camp so it turned into a bit of a dungeon crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother party consisted of an undead doctor and a tinker. They operated a clinic repairing people and things when they got mixed up with a mentally unbalanced messenger and get embroiled in a plot involving the servants of Death recruiting them to help take down a cult that was attempting to bring large, nasty demons into their plane.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has all been very heroic so far. We have not played with anything too far outside of that. Does this sound interesting to anyone? Anything need more clarification? I know I'm being a bit vague, but I would love to get more people involved in the game testing and don't want to set everything in stone and keep people from being creative. Their IS a solid setting, but I want it to be a useful system as well as setting.

I've played quite a few games that could be sincerely described as "slightly crunchy, without classes or levels" and they're all really different from one another.<br/><br/>What people are trying to get you to articulate is what the <i>point</i> is of playing your game.  What are the interesting choices that people playing your game get to make, that (and this is the important part) they don't get to make when playing other games on the market?  Your list of tabletop games doesn't include anything from the "indie" or "story-game" spectrum, but game design in the last decade or so has really moved away from setting details as the thing to distinguish games from one another.<br/><br/>Setting design <i>in support of</i> a focused game with a clear point to it is great, mind you\u2014take a look at Fred Hicks' game Don't Rest Your Head, f'rex.  But DRYH works so well because the mechanics also help the group hone that feeling of intense personal psychological horror, because of the way the dice pools work.<br/><br/>All the games you listed, even though they are in some minor ways diverse, contain numerous core cultural assumptions: there's a GM, the PCs are extraordinary individuals in some way, there's a plot that is essentially external to the characters' personal concerns, and the rules are basically there to model some combination of the physics of the world and the tropes of the game's genre.  (There are probably other embedded assumptions but those are the main ones that jump out at me.)  Many of the most active posters on this forum have played and even written games that toss out one or more of these core facets of RPG design, and invent others to take their place, all to achieve specific effects.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that you should write some hippified story-game without a GM or dice.  What I am saying is that the choices that a designer makes about all these various aspects of a game have a huge impact on the experiences of people who play it, and all of them need to be carefully considered.  Right now, you're not in a position to make informed choices about where to set these different "dials," because you've only ever played games that had each of them in a certain, traditional location.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KaneBlaireau" title="KaneBlaireau"><img alt="KaneBlaireau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KaneBlaireau">KaneBlaireau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341539/#Comment_341539" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T22:30:41+00:00" title="September  3, 2011 10:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2011 11:03PM by KaneBlaireau.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. Well, I will honestly have to think on that. I have thought many times about using an existing system to tell my story, but none of them really work for me. As I said, I wanted a game where you could play anything you want that has an open system so that you could customize just about everything. For example, I want magic to be something personal to each character, so I am writing a system that allows you to write your own spells. It has something akin to a Feat system (like 3.5) to allow to make a melee focused character fight the way you want it. I suppose the issue I am having is that the system was written as a generic system and was not originally tied to any one setting, so their are no rules supporting the setting specifically. Something to think about, I guess...do I keep it a generic system or start pushing it towards on specific setting?<br/><br/>Let me ask you this. What is different or better about non-standard RPGs?

Now I <i>am</i> going to be dismissive and even more blunt than before: if you have a story to tell, write a novel or a play or a screenplay or even a video game, but stay the hell away from designing RPGs or GMing.

The mechanics just do nothing for me. I like a lot of the ideas, but the execution doesn't work for me.

Bits and pieces of each that worked for me and leaving everything out to make a streamlined whole without making it boring (like GURPS to me).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><br/>Ugh.

It's a big difference from making it freely available, and even beyond just the rules you'll have a lot to think about in time. Asking people for money means you have to deliver something beyond "download at your own risk." As soon as you attach that price tag, you're responsible for something. How do you make sure your game is worth $5 or $15 or however much?<br/><br/>Everyone above is saying "play all these games." It's a good idea, mostly because what you've listed includes games that share a lot of concepts. If that's exactly what you want, you'll have a hard time convincing anyone to try your game when they could just play the games that they already know. You've probably seen those discussions elsewhere on the internet, people saying they don't want to learn another new rules system. By and large they have a point, if the new system does pretty much the same thing as the old one.<br/><br/>There's every possibility that your game actually does fit the more traditional RPG model and maybe just needs some additional rules to handle X, whatever X is. That's something to really think about, making your game as a supplement/setting that's compatible with an existing game. You have immediate access to that game's fanbase. But that's up to you of course.<br/><br/>And just to clarify, a lot of people here have done what you're doing and want to help you avoid the stupid shit we all did. Publishing a game is pretty exciting, but it can also end up being a terrible disappointment after all the work you put into it. I'm excited about your setting.
