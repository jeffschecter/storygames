You and your team have been dispatched to the site of a major zombie outbreak with instructions to contain and eliminate the threat. Using your brute strength, agility and ingenuity, see if you can score the most zombie kills without becoming their lunch!<br/><br/>This is a friendly-but-competitive, GM-less, rules-lite RPG which starts when you roll 101d6 to represent the 101 Zombies that must be destroyed before they overrun the site and force the PCs to retreat or die. This edition includes an additional chapter of optional content for the game, covering special zombies types, character talents and mission goals. Both digital and print format pdfs are included in the package.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450554/#Comment_450554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-11T19:33:36+00:00" title="January 11, 2016  7:33PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2016 7:33PM by catty_big.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have played it, it's a fun game.
