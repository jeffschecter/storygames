It's like fanmail, but fanmail as the base mechanic of the game, essentially.<br/><br/>If I make badass stakes, you spend your dice on d10s instead of d4s, because you want to see me succeed. The same happens if your stakes are cool. Minutiae become a way to collaboratively craft a scene, as well as  give props.<br/><br/>The dice turn into a way of saying "this is a cool direction to take the story" and "I'm actually more keen to go in a different direction, dude". Even though there is dice rolling, it FEELS like freeform.<br/><br/>Anyways, I really like this. It is WAY more a social mechanic than a "hard" mechanic. I'm not sure if this makes sense to you, or if you've had this experience, but I really like it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62469/#Comment_62469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T13:22:47+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  1:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really sharp insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62475/#Comment_62475" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T13:33:54+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  1:33PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm going to have to get this game after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
