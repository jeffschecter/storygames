The person that sits across form you plays the Mistaken for you controlling as adversity that comes against you. Those to either side play the Moons that are neutral judges of what happens and play any characters that are not against you. the thread on the con forum has some more details about how the game works.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig played Giauzar<br/>\nJon played Canis Major. Played Scutum, the Shield.<br/>\nMe as Equaleus.<br/>\nThat is how we sat around the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with Craig playing Giauzar, me as his Mistaken, with Jon and Scutum's player as the Moons.<br/>\nThere was no set story or plot and just work things out as we play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hope was not yet lost for Giauzar still heard the song of the stars.<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Giauzar ventured forth in the Spring to fight of the Mistaken with a group of fellow knights. this is a dangerous time for the People as all but the Knights stand frozen before the rising of the sun. A single Mistaken that appears in form like one of the insect steeds of the people approaches them along the side of the canyon wall but Giauzar sneaks up apon it and slays it but he then sees a large army of these creatures lead by a demon knight riding atop one of them approaching from further along the canyon.<br/>\nand that is how it came to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone takes a turn with their character being the main character of the story with the other players taking the roles of mistaken and moons depending on how they sit around the table.<br/>\nThe key phrase "And so it was..." is used to start a scene with a character. "and that is how it came to pass." is used to accept everything that has happened and end a scene. I'll be using those to mark when one player starts his turn and when his turn ends ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hope was not yet lost for Scutum still heard the song of the stars.<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Scutum, a week before the Spring came and Giauzar ventured into the wastes to fight the Mistaken, took part in tournament of the People. Jon sets the stage here since he is Scutums Mistaken. Scutum and Jon's character Canus Major are enemies ut we don't yet know why. Jon says the tournament is to see who is the strongest, fastest, and tallest of the People. Canus and Scutum are in a wrestling match to see who is the strongest. Scutum is the largest and strongest of the two so he has an advantage in this. They trade feet and hold him overhead but Canus rips off Scutums lion cloth during this to embarrass him. Scutum calls forth his starlight shield preserve his dignity.<br/>\nand that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nall of the Knights have weapons of starlight that they can call forth though some carry preferment weapons with them instead.<br/>\nWe have the idea of making Equuleus (Means of the Horse) the demon that Giauzar is fighting I set my character one year in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat in the Spring one year before Giauzar rode into the wastes Equuleus rides out with his friends Scutum and Canus Minor (brother of Canus Major) at the start of the spring to fight the Mistaken. They find a great lord of the demons and a host of lesser demons at his command. Scutum calls forth his starlight sword and shield and does battle with the lesser Mistaken while the demon lord rides toward Canus Minor to kill him. Equuleus must choose between the saving Scutum or Canus Minor and chooses to save Scutum. Canus Minor is beheaded in a single blow while Equuleus and Scutum kill or set to flight most of the demon's host. Scutum strikes down kill the demon lord but only if Equuleus is blinded. And that is how it happened that Scutum cut down the demon lord moments before it struck down Equuleus but the foul blood of the demon spills upon Equuleus and blinds him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon plays his character Canus Major next setting the scene himself rather then letting his Mistaken (Scutum's player) do it for him since he has an idea that ties in with the 2 starlight swords he wields.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nat the funeral for his brother Canus Minor Canus Major blames and berates Equuleus for the death of his brother and laments that they could not even bring back Minor's head for a proper burial. Canus proclaims that Equalies is no Knight his brother's star shall be forever dimiished because of his incomplete burial. Admist the mourners for Canus Minor Canus Major rips off his brothers arm and proclaims that he shall have it forged into a second starlight sword. To try and molify Canus Major the priest tells him that if he wins glories with his brothers sword his brother's star will shine the brighter for it. Canus Major punches the priest in the face and goes to kill him only to be stopped by Scutum.<br/>\nAnd that is how Canus Major came to wield 2 starlight swords and the rivalry between him and Scutum was created.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now return to Giauzar in the present time.<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nGiauzar now fights man to man with the demon knight of the Mistaken while his companions try to hold off the horde of demon steeds that pour forth form the Mistake. The demon knight wears 2 heads at his belt (One is Canus Minors.) and threatens to add Giauzar's head as well before calling forth his blade of blackness and smoke that lets forth a horrid wail as he charges. Giauzar calls forth his sword of starlight that sings in a pure tone, charging to meet the demon lord. He cuts off the demons sword arm and turns to face him for a second pass. The demon lord rips off one of the legs form his mount and uses it as a spear to renew the attack against Giauzar only to lose his other arm.<br/>\nand that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nDuring Scutum and Canus Major's fight (1 week before present) at the tournament Canus Major is thrown aside by Scutum and as he lies on the ground picks up a large rock and attacks Scutum with it. Scutum seeing this sticks back at Canus with his starlight shield that he was using to preserve his dignity crushing Canus's face with it.<br/>\nWhile somewhat disgraced Scutum is awarded the trophy for being the strongest this year. As Scutum is leaving the tournament yard he sees Giauzar preparing for his journey into the wastes of the Mistake. He goes to see Canus major in the doctors tent to apologize for the injury he dealt him. He sees that Canus is having his face patched up with the light of the hated sun for as the doctors says \xe2\u20ac\u0153It it not beautiful?\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153Does it not give us light so we do not dwell in darkness?\xe2\u20ac\x9d. But the knights know that the sun is the cause of the People destruction and the herald of the Mistaken's attacks and hate it for that. Canus is angry and will not be consoled calling both Scutum and himself false knights and unworthy for having acted so lowly in the fight. Canus says that there is a true Knight of the Order of the Starts and you passed him on your way here, think about that.<br/>\nand that is how it happened.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72082/#Comment_72082" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T18:24:15+00:00" title="May 27, 2007  6:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And so it was...<br/>\nEquuleus (1 year before present) returns home to mourn the fact that 2 great knights have been lost to the cause, one to death and himself to blindness. But his faithful servant Savik(Really a servant of the Mistaken) tells him of a doctor in another Remnant that can restore his sight and he will lead him there. Following Savik Equuleus is led deep into the wastes where he meets with one of the Mistaken and he learns how to restore his sight but only if he swears to call the Mistaken master and serve him. And so it was that by blood he lost his sight and blood he will regain it but it must be the blood of the innocent.<br/>\nPerhaps it was some evil sorcerer or the weakness in the knights heart but we find Equuleus lead by his servant Savik in the bed chambers of the sleeping Su'hail that very night. Su'hail who is the most beautiful in appearance, song, and innocence amongst the People. Equuleus is at first dismayed at what he is about to do but tells himself that one life is a small price to pay compared to how many shall be lost if the People lose the service of a knight as great as he. Calling forth his starlight sword Equuleus kills Su'hail but only if this alerts Prince Rigel to his presence. And so it was that Prince Rigel sees that Equuleus killed his daughter, the most beautiful of the People, but Equuleus tells him that a great evil has been removed from here and leaves Rigel to his mourning.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened having done this horrible crime that Equuleus went to meet his new master in the wastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nCanus Major and Equuleus have been no more then a week apart since the funereal we come across him being called before Prince Rigel. With the sound of the mourner's songs being sung for the innocent Su'hail around them Prince Rigel beseeches Canus to find why Equuleus had killed his daughter and to kill Equuleus if it is possible. Canus still felling the lose of his brother and blaming Equuleus vows to kill Equuleus. Going to his friend Giauzar Canus begs him to come as well and help in the search. While they did not find Equuleus in the first week since Equuleus is with his new master in the wastes they do find his servant Savik. Canus tortures Savik to get answers from him but receives none. Giauzar finding this to have happened saw that Canus was mad and forced Canus to swear that he would not kill Equuleus if he did not have evidence that Equuleus deserved death.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are around half done now and i'll get the rest up as I have time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72531/#Comment_72531" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T18:16:21+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  6:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And so it was...<br/>\nNow the demon lord who faced Giauzar knew he was in desperate place indeed and strove to overbear the stout knight with his steed and in doing so his plan was twofold. The first was to take some blood from Giauzar to heal his own wounds with and secondly to blind Giauzar with his own blood. But Giauzar was not so easily overcome and prevented the demon from blinding him but the demon bite him cruelly and by that blood regained his arms. Calling forth a demon steed for himself and for Giauzar he said \xe2\u20ac\u0153Come brave Knight, let us both remount and make this a real fight.\xe2\u20ac\x9d. And having said that he remounted his own steed and caused the heads apon his belt to sing as to bring down the cavern on all who fought within.<br/>\nGiauzar seeing this slew the demon steed offered him renewed the fight with great vigor facing the Demon Knight swearing that he would defeat him and see his men to safety.<br/>\nand that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy memory begins to fail me at this part and I cannot recall how much was Scutums play and how much my own for the next part though I know I am forgetting most of one turn around the table here. During this Canus Major approached Scutum and during their quarrel it was revealed that Scutum had in the past sworn to protect Equuleus's life with his own. In game terms that was something Scutum's player had to accept to gain his ends in another part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Equuleus returned form the wastes and his new master's services went to Scutum's house. In great distress Equuleus begged Scutum to protect his life with his own for he had done great wrongs and feared that some may wish to do him ill in revenge for it. On having Scutum's promise he swore that he loved him as a brother and declared \xe2\u20ac\u0153Let us be done with such sorrowful thoughts and make merry while we can.\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Heading out they drank and made merry until Equuleus servant Savik found them. Savik told Equuleus that his master demanded his presence. This angered Equuleus greatly and he yelled at this servant to let them be and when Savik pressed further Equuleus struck him a blow that threw Savik to the ground. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Go tell  my master that I will see him when I am ready to do so.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\nEquuleus would not answer any question put to him on this matter by Scutum and so Scutum left Equuleus to his drink alone.<br/>\nhaving  his  merry mood ruined and his companion left him Equuleus put off the unpleasant task no longer and went into the wastes to meet his master. On meeting this lord of the Mistaken Equuleus called him by his name Price Rigel and asked what service was needed now.<br/>\nAnd that was how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon had the idea to make Prince Rigel the lord of the Mistaken at this point. It took me completely by surprise that Prince Rigel had set this whole thing up from the start with Equuleus's blindness, the murder of his daughter, and corrupting Canus with thoughts of vengeance.<br/>\nAlso at this point my Knight had lost all of his Zeal. Zeal measures a Knight's devoutness to his cause and is a powerful in game resource. A knight may lose some when ever he betrays the People or from  other acts unworthy of a knight. A knight with no Zeal can fall and become one of the Mistaken and that is what happened here. Equuleus official became the Demon Knight that Giauzar is fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73870/#Comment_73870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T16:14:02+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  4:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have really begun to get to the end of the game with all of our separate stories having come together. Jon started chasing as many experience checks as he could to get rid Canus's Zeal so Canus could die. Craig and Scutum's player started doing the same shortly after. This worked well to drive the game at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Canus returned to the wastes having delivered the details of the Remnant's defenses to the mistaken and received his answer. Enraged Canus returned by hearing that Prince Rigel had betrayed them all in this way he returns to the Remnant to find it guarded by none other then Scutum who barred him entry. Canus rants and raves that he must enter but Scutum only relents once Canus suggests and submits to being bound in chains.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiauzar<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat as Giauzar continued his the fight against the demon lord as the cavern of ice fell their swords of starlight and darkness struck back and forth until Giauzar saw that he could not beat the demon face to face. Striking a blow that stunned the Demon Giauzar slipped into the shadows beside himfor a moment. And that moment came shortly as the demon lord looked around for him Giauzar jumped forth and plunged his sword into the demon's back killing him. AS the Demon lord of the Horses fell the cavern ceased to crumble and a miraculous thing happened. Su'hail's head that was worn at the waist of the demon lord began to sing as glowing gate opened by the demons body leading into a dark tunnel.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nScutum<br/>\nAnd soit was that Scutum with Canus in chains behind him went forth into the Remnant as Canus bade him to find Prince Rigel. On and on they passed through the silent city as the people stood quite and motionless held captive by the rising Sun. At last they came to Prince Rigels dwelling and found him there by the Sepulture of his daughter Su'hail. But he was unaffected by the rising Sun a thing known to only the Mistaken who's only rest is during the Winter and those that have sworn the oth of the Knights of the Stars.<br/>\nAnd that was how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy character is done know since he has fallen as a Knight and been slain as a the Demon Lord. So now I only play one of the Moons to Jon and Scutum's player and the Mistaken for Giauzar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73871/#Comment_73871" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T16:14:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  4:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had one round around the table that I cannot remember how it went.<br/>\nIt is revealed Prince Rigel is a Mistaken both Scutum and Canus fight him. First Scutum fights and is defeated but not killed then Canus breaks out of his manacles and fights him to be defeated as well. During this we see what {Prince Rigel's plan was. With the path way created by Equuleus's death to Su'hail's sepulture hordes of demons begin to rush through to destroy this Remnant of the city Polaris. On their backs in a mockery of life is the body the demon steads carry the body of Equuleus, now recognizable without his helmet or armor. I really wish I could remember how this part went because it was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nand so it was...<br/>\nGiauzar drops the severed heads at the sepulture and begins to slay the demons as they stream into the Remnant. But they are too many and soon the Mistaken begin to force their way past him headless of their fallen. But on Giauzar fights with the hope that he may save some of the People by holding the Mistaken back long enough for the Sun to finish rising and thus free the people from its evil spell.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Scutum seeing the body of his dear friend Equuleus who he had sworn with his life to protect is caught by grief. As the body passes by him he sees wounds on Equuleus's back such as Giauzar would do and knows that his friend was the demon that Giauzar spoke of killing. Turning his back on the People in this hour of need Scutum follows after Giauzar with thoughts of murder.<br/>\nScutum attacks Giauzar but after a short fight is thrown to the ground by the other Knight. Giauzar reproaches him in his madness of grief to leave vengeance aside and try to save the people before leaving to continue the fight.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nthat Canus was left at the sepulture of Su'hail overcome by the tragedy he had done his People. Then the head of his brother begins to speak to him from where it lays. The head of Canus's brother cries \xe2\u20ac\u0153Why have you done this my brother?\xe2\u20ac\x9d and reproaches him while lamenting how they both have fallen. Calling forth both his and his brother's starlight swords Canus throws them at the head destroying it before he falls to his knees in grief as the hordes of Mistaken stream past him into the Remnant.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was...<br/>\nGiauzar continued to fight bravely against the Mistaken who seemed without number as they ravaged the Remnant killing all they could find. Onward he went saving the few of the People that he could still find and slaying Mistaken beyond counting.<br/>\nOne Knight alone could not save the Remnant but Prince Rigel and the Oracle's work was done well, only Giauzar to oppose them. But bravely he fought for he would not falter while there was even the smallest hope.<br/>\nWhile Giauzar bravely fought the Mistaken and was momentarily overcome Scutum came up from behind him intending to kill the defenseless Knight but as he approached the one he had called companion but a few days ago Scutum was over come by the Mistaken and the force of them bore him away to another part of the Remnant.<br/>\nAnd that was how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it was..<br/>\nthat Scutum found himself carried by the demon steeds of the Mistake until they dropped him in an open square. To the horror of Scutum he saw before him the Oracle of the Wastes and a mockery of a wedding made of demons and the dead of the Remnant. Come called the Oracle and wed the mother of your children for she had worked evil magics with his hair to conceive children of his. While the dead priest intoned the ceremony of marriage a demon approached him with a ring that burned red hot and thrust it on his finger. The pain bringing him back to his senses Scutum slew all present including his own unborn children.<br/>\nAnd that is how it happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73872/#Comment_73872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T16:14:59+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  4:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And so it was...<br/>\nthat the Remnant of Southwatch fell to the Mistaken, a sorrow for the People of the likes not seen since the Mistake first appeared. Many good Knights were lost, many lost to their vices and personal failings before the Remnant fell, and the People grieved for this terrible tradgedy.
