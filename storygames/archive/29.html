                    I want to position my game products as books rather than magazines. That is, they are not dead after 90 days, requiring transfusions of interest driven <b>solely</b> (note emphasis) by the supplement treadmill. Instead, they continue to sell, year after year.<br/><br/>I actually think I've figured out the way to do this.<br/><br/>Sink most advertising efforts and expenses into the main book, <i><b>forever</b></i>. So long as sales support it, continue to sell ads for the main book. It doesn't matter how long ago it came out. (Think: how many <i>years</i> did V&amp;V and <i>Skyrealms of Jorune</i> and <i>Spell Law</i> ads run in Dragon Magazine?)<br/><br/>If a supplement comes out, they get a month (or two, max) of higher ad priority, but after that, they get regulated to singing back-up for the frontman.<br/><br/>Comments on this? Other thoughts on bringing the industry back to a book-basis rather than a periodical-basis?<br/><br/><br/>CU                </div>

                            Supplements are interesting stuff. With Burning Wheel, we have two approaches to supplements.<br/>
<br/>
We have our free Web-based stuff. It's all top-quality material that provides a new way to play the game. It draws people in. <br/>
<br/>
We've even prepared some of it (Dark Elves, Under a Serpent Sun, Burning Sand: Jihad) as printed pamphlets with great art. At cons, they provide supplemental revenue and something to offer our hardcore fans that have already bought the core but want to continue to express their enjoyment with dollars.<br/>
<br/>
The Monster Burner is currently the sole example of our second type of supplement. It's a full printed book with the same physical properties as the core. We sell it through distro like the core, as well as direct. The Monster Burner is all about taking the system apart and showing players how to customize its elements according to the rules those elements were built with in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Our finding was that we could guarantee selling 750 Monster Burners with an addressable market of 3,000 (i.e., with 3,000 core books in players' hands). In other words, we were able to very accurately predict the size of the print run we could go with and still move them all.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up going with a 1,000 book print run. Now that our addressable market is above 3,000, the Monster Burner is nearly sold out. <br/>
<br/>
But we never really treat the Monster Burner as a product on its own. We sell Burning Wheel. The Monster Burner is an extension of Burning Wheel.                        </div>

<i><b>Other thoughts on bringing the industry back to a book-basis rather than a periodical-basis?</b></i><br/><br/>Very interesting.<br/><br/>First off, I gotta ask (because I forgot) are you a fulltime game publisher nowadays, like Phil Reed? Or is this a side thing? I ask because the amount of effort expended in promoting has to meet the available time you have to give.<br/><br/>Second, the only way to get back to a book-based medium is basically:<br/><br/>* Giving the middle finger to Alliance, who lives off of that market, and seek new forums for distribution.<br/><br/>* Creating a culture of expectation for gamers where they look for One Book to give them enjoyment, and if they like you game to look for your other games, or similar games, not more additions to the One Book.<br/><br/>This is hardest, and dare I say the most challenging, manipulative part of this whole plan. We have to re-engineer gamers to come to think that for some games (er, ONE GAME actually), a supplement treadmill is fine. But for all other games, supplements are mostly:<br/>- A ploy to make money while "coasting"<br/>- A ploy employed to make a game look active<br/>- Unnecessary fluff<br/>- Not nearly as useful as your own ideas<br/>- Not as fun to collect as More Games<br/><br/>I say the above not because I think it's true in every case of supplements, but that it's "mostly true",  "worth thinking about", or "supplements should be the exception, not the rule". I sound like Hitler up there commanding a pogrom of hate, but instilling a sense of reflection about our hobby and our needs from our hobby will be healthier overall for the One Book Tribe.<br/><br/>And we ahve to drill this in, over and over, until the scales tip away from the "games without supplements are dead games" side.<br/><br/>If nothing else, it will make gamers very critical of supplements, which is good for everyone. We'll see less fluff like fanfic disguised as setting/background, and more "Play With This!" data and solid direction in supplements.<br/><br/>* Likewise, we have to try to manipulate new publishers into thinking that creatng a line of supplements is the "cheap and easy way out".  Now, many folks are full-timers and make their livelihoods off of the treadmill. We're not going to influence those folk. But we can inluence the consumer (above) and the folks who don't publish full-time.<br/><br/>* Backing up your One Books by engaging in printing methods that insure that the game will never go "Out of Print' (ie POD). This will be the "middle finger" or closing argument in the "Games without supplements are NOT FUCKING DEAD" debates: "My game has no supplements, and you will still be able to easily purchase it 20 years from now as you are able to purchase it today".<br/><br/>These are just a couple additions to your marketing thing.                        </div>

                            There's also a side-effect "series" thing that's starting to crop up in the indie ranks.  It started nigh-accidentally, but folks are starting to pay attention to it and promote it intentionally.  That being: the series is <em>by author</em>, including many individual games, not <em>by game line</em>, including many supplements to a single game.<br/><br/>The "Clinton Nixon Line" is The Shadow of Yesterday, Donjon, Paladin, City of Brass, and soon Face of Angels.<br/>The "Jared Sorenson Line" is Memento-Mori, The Farm, octaNe, Lacuna, and many more.<br/>The "Vincent Baker Line" is kill puppies for satan, Dogs in the Vineyard, and soon Dragon Killer.<br/>Et cetera.<br/><br/>A little while ago Forge folks were talking about authors using distinctive trademarks on their book spines and perhaps even numbering their books.  The idea being that customers will want to buy "the complete set" of a given author based on quality rather than "they all go to the same game."  Vincent's seen some good sales in his "Dogs and puppies" package deal that suggests that this is a model that will work.<br/><br/>Personally, every day that goes by makes me wonder why we put up with supplements in the first place.  If this information is important, why isn't it in the main book?  If it's not important, why do I want to buy it?                        </div>

                            The periodical method of publication exists (aside from the distro issue) because there's nothing new to say in game design when you're designing the WoD/D&amp;D/GURPS specifications.<br/>
<br/>
When you're changing thematic territory with each game, you can sell those books for as long as people are interested in those themes. And, really, if themes don't last a long time, they're not themes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can see future books exploring a theme better than you have before, but that's stuff that's often years in the making.                        </div>
