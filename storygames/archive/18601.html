Another 6 or so, I've had to hack to be able to play them. For most of the rest, I took what I found inspiring and tried it on another game with different results.<br/></blockquote>\nWarriorMonk,<br/><br/>This is really interesting, and I bet a lot of people here would love to hear about those experiences, and how those games were not compatible with your game group. From a design and marketing standpoint, this sounds like a goldmine of information and would make great feedback. How would you feel about starting a new thread about those experiences?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhoa, how to resume my 12 years of experience of hacking and analyzing as many games as I could access, only to pitch my results against the adventure-insatiable, powergaming, story-bending, setting-breaker horde I call my group of players? Well, for one thing, hard. But in the end, really fun.<br/><br/>I'll start by expanding a bit on the games I was thinking when I wrote the original post. The only game we played as it is was <i>Kingdom</i> by Ben Robbins, since our group had played something similar almost by accident and I got interested enough to be part of the beta testing. So it was not like I'd hack the game, but also not like I needed to hack it at all. My pals owed me one so they rolled with it when I brought it to the table, and we all ended having lots of fun.<br/><br/>The second close that required almost no hacking at all was <i>3:16 Carnage Among the Stars</i>, by Gregor Hutton. We had an excellent short campaign of that one and it came as a blessing to me since I was kinda burned as a GM at that moment, and relaxing from doing prep did a lot of good to me, I could just sit back and enjoy GMing it. Three changes I remember I made was that:<br/>-we didn't use the flashback mechanic. It struck us as something that stopped the action in it's rails and an emergency button to push in case of a TPK... that for the players, was any time that I pulled a couple scratches on their characters. <br/><br/>To balance this and increase party survival I placed a mock figure of the soldier in the character sheet (which I redesigned) with a armor check and a single heatlh box for each part of the body. Players had the chance of trying to protect vital areas with their hands or sacrificing a leg. I was happy with it, though one player told me later he preferred a number of HP and maybe a value for his armor, that could decrease when hit. I thought that was understandable since he was more used to computer rpgs.<br/><br/>I loved the freedom of Fate aspects and mixed this with a d6 pool system for a one shot... which was all it could stand. The one mistake Fate had was that it didn't include a proper list of aspects. Yes, it's cool, I understood that a word, phrase or relationship could do, I saw the same in Dogs later, but whenever me or my players tried to assemble characters that way, we kept hitting the same blank page syndrome and taking forever to create a character. That was when I learned that creativity doesn't come easy to all of us and that actual skill lists help a lot to figure out what kind of character you can make. Stopping every few minutes to ask the GM "hey, can I add X to my skill list?" and having the GM think fast if that won't ruin his campaign also doesn't do much for speeding character creation.<br/><br/>Another lesson I learned there: quick adding the results of a bunch of d6 rolled isn't something that everybody does at the same speed. I totally sucked at this and as a GM taking your time on reading and interpreting dice isn't a luxury you can afford. It was worse if two people or more decided to collaborate and add their dice together, and dividing your dice to do more things isn't as cool as it sounds when you deal with an additive system. These practices often trhow it all out of balance, which is also why I take good measures to avoid anything that may breake the math. That always means that as a GM there's a good chance you get crushed under a pile of bonuses that seem to come out of nowhere, but that you actually wrote in the rules without noticing. Because the players will notice. Specially my group.<br/><br/>From Don't Rest Your Head I learned that you could actually had the strangest and most colorful kewl powers, tailor-made for your character in no prep-time... but then I couldn't make heads-nor-tail about what to put those characters against. The game addendum with more examples of colorful powers was actually the first thing that I readed and though it did a lot for me about seeing how this bizarre dimension was like, still left me thinking of how to prep for a session or handle the different groups. I'll probably head back to this game sometime, there are more things to explore there than you could believe, but there's also a big hole of procedures to fill there, at least to get my group play it.<br/><br/>I was also kind of sad that most of the story games that specifically focus in collaborative stories are not meant for my group. Not that they can't create an story together (we're comic creators, that's what we do most of the time) but they can use the smallest excuse to make a game into a sort of competition. Not by being agressive, but by being hilarious, which can be sort of passive agressive or even blatantly defiant without coming to direct agression. I've seen them stablish scenes just to make fun of each other's character and get competitive on that. Hilarious as it was, nobody would call this collaborative storytelling anyway. And once one session of a game went that way, there was no way to take out that behavior when the same game was played.<br/><br/>Ok, perhaps now you're thinking "buddy, you totally shouldn't play with those dudes" and I'll say bullshit, these are my friends, they know me, I know them and we have fun in a different way than you do. Some games work better than others for us, and we've had really amazing moments. It's just that we can't travel in delicate elven ships, we need fraggin navy destroyers from hell made of titanum and loaded with creative weaponry; we need solid rules and procedures, some inspirational help to make insteresting characters, complete freedom to play them, having our input actually matter and be able to affect the game flow in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Rules based on the best scenario for a player group won't do. Complex and detailed dice mechanics/systems won't do. Unfocused / ruleslite systems won't do. Giving the players authority won't do unless it's balanced with the GM authority, and so on. <br/><br/>I'll explain some more of my experiencewith these and other games later, but I'd also like to know, what game didn't work for you or your group and why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418111/#Comment_418111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T23:15:43+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 11:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 3.5 didn't work for me. There was a large group with no consistency over who or how many players would show up at the GM's house in any given week, and by the time a fight was ready to begin, I was ready to cheerfully murder the players, including the ones I liked a lot. Bad match of system and playstyle for me.<br/><br/>Feng Shui I can play, but I can't run it.<br/><br/>Smallville crashed and burned for my group mostly because I kept finding making the character sheets for the foils a pain and I never did good preparation. I hope to try again, but right now, the combination of crunch and probable intended customization makes me freeze up as a GM.<br/><br/>After a playtest of Eternal Lies, I had trouble getting Gumshoe playtesters. Investigation system? No problem! Eternal Lies itself? Gorgeous! The General System -- i.e., combat and non-investigation stuff? I'll be curled in a ball whimpering as I try to figure out what I'm doing. Again, this is as a GM. As a player, if the GM knows Gumshoe, I'm fine. I want to see what Bubblegumshoe is like, and I think I'd like to be a grasshopper watching a good Gumshoe GM run a session so I can figure out what the heck I'm doing wrong.<br/><br/>Certain players I know are bad matches for certain types of games. So, I consider myself jazz and blues deaf, which doesn't bug me in day to day life, but which I do consider a flaw. One of my Kerberos players is the same way about horror.  No harm, no foul -- it's just not something he finds appealing to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418112/#Comment_418112" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T23:48:45+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 11:48PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM, I think the "these are my friends and who I want to play with" thing is often underestimated in terms of gaming decisionmaking.

I can play most games except <b>Universalis</b>.<br/><br/><b>Deadlands</b>, first edition. This was my first English roleplaying game, and it was during a time when I was twenty and rules were everything. I stopped playing the game when I realized that all we did was rolling dice during combat - one attack could result in up to seven different rolls in that game! That, and the fact that the game gave me no Sergio Leone feelings. They totally forgot how to deliver the mood and just served crunch for breakfast instead.<br/><br/><b>Mouse Guard</b>. I read and played it four years ago, and it was like I travelled ten years back in my roleplaying career. Not a game style I want to go back too. I played the introduction adventure The Grain Peddler, which is basically based on two skill rolls with a tiny backstory that gave almost no clues on what was going on. To "challenge" the players with just dice roll is a gaming style I buried a long time ago. The skill rolls are impossible so the mice has to cooperate - a touch in the system I like - but because it was so hard, the mice got seriously hurt and the points they earned through the GM phase was spent on healing themselves in the player phase. That sucked! Nothing really happened!<br/><br/>Later on, I learned that I should have involved their  beliefs but I played the intro adventure with pre-made characters and the game didn't instruct me in how to do it. It didn't even say in the book how I should handle beliefs! And the game system is a mess with slim skills, weird cross dependencies, things that do the same stuff, specific exceptions in the system and so on. I liked the skill Weather Watching and the character creation, and I could probably play the game with someone who understands the game, but I will never ever game master it.<br/><br/><b>Matin\xe9</b>. This is a great game that mixes traditional with some new influences with game design, and it focus hard on player narrative. It's a game that I've made, but now when I'm looking through it, I don't want to play it. The character creation doesn't do anything of how my playstyle is now. I'm still using the scenario creation model - the fish tank - and a lot of the techniques and mantras, but I can't make any player go through the character creation again. It's not hard and it takes 30-60 minutes, but it's time that could be spent on collaborative scenario creation or on playing the game instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418141/#Comment_418141" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T11:39:34+00:00" title="July 11, 2013 11:39AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 11:54AM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, Storn, what happened to you with Smallville and Exalted was the same thing that happened to me with Anima. And believe me, Smallville possibilities for customization are but a small fraction of the things you can do with Anima (Exalted is closer I think, except for the multiclassing department). I actually love that, but getting into all the detail of a single level 1 character makes look handling my 15 level pathfinder monk a really simple task. And this last one stresses me to no avail. I ended up hacking Anima with everything that I could find and streamlining all choices to, lately, a single description and a few keywords that limit what the character can do.<br/><br/>We even used a hack of Microscope for one session that revealed a lot of obscure facts of the setting. It was amazing to be able to roleplay something that otherwise would be boring exposition. It also saved me the work of actually writing all that exposition. However I don't think my players would go into a stand alone game of Microscope, since we work writing comics using a method much like the game, and though we have fun with it, we prefer to stick to our characters. And writing comics isn't roleplaying, at least in our heads.<br/><br/>I like D&amp;D in general, Pathfinder a bit more, but I'm sure I'll never run any of those. Too complex, too much small rules that you need to consider are scattered through the whole book, creating characters and leveling them up is a chore since I don't feel comfortable neither cheating on the GM nor missing any of the bonuses than I can get out from the game.<br/><br/>Thanks for the love, JD.<br/><br/>Edit: Terwox, Rickard, neither I got what beliefs was all about in MG. Sounded like Fate aspects to me but that was all I could make of it, and the whole introduction made it feel like you would lose an important part of the experience without that.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418145/#Comment_418145" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T13:15:22+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  1:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard: players were too focused on paying attention to the mechanics metagame.

The game has more been about beating the odds of living as a squatter in the bleak SR universe than about high powered runs. The only 'real' run we did was a break in somewhere.

One is "what won't I GM because I don't want to?", and that's a decently long list. (Answer: anything with fight scenes that last over an hour, even though I'm pleased to have lengthy D&amp;D 4e encounters as a player.) The other way, though, is "what haven't I been able to GM because of my gaming group's preferences?" And that's the trickier one. I am dying to play <b>Monsterhearts</b>, but the way the playbooks are laid out, the first thing you see in the top left corner is "Sex Move." Some of my players kind of freaked out when they saw that, especially knowing the game is about teenagers. (Maybe it didn't bother anybody in Apocalypse World because the sex moves are called "Special" moves, or because sexual relationships aren't as obviously central to the genre.) I backed the Second Skins Kickstarter largely so I could read the stuff about alternate ways to play the game, hoping to find some variant that won't freak out my players so much, maybe as a stepping stone to the game as originally designed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418199/#Comment_418199" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T07:01:21+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  7:01AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2013 8:05AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I so want to gather everybody who can't play <b>Feng Shui</b> and play with them.

Since he stated it openly, we haven't been able to had romantic scenes or much drama in that way. Don't get me wrong, I don't miss the homo, I just miss the romance.<br/><br/>Oh, btw, for all I readed of the Song of Fire and Ice RPG, it's meant to recreate the books, not the series. I found it really cool that you can have your character apparently die, only to come back alive in the least expected moment. And that, system-wise, not by in-game detailed previous preparation. I love the social subsystems and seeing the character generated by it's background, but the rest is your usual D&amp;D less alignment stuff and using low-magic characters, so again, I'd have to hack it a lot to play it. Prepping interesting NPCs with a complicated system always turns me off from GMing it.<br/><br/>And yes, Feng Shui looks really cool in paper, until you realize in the session that players creativity for describing fights can be painfully slow. Not having anybody interrupt the scene is like keeping the spotlight in a comediant who isn't bad, but could do a lot better if he wasn't doing a solo act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418213/#Comment_418213" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T07:53:59+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  7:53AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a player, the only game I've sworn off is <b>Feng Shui</b>.

I can RUN the game just fine, reacting to all the moves my players make, but there's just not enough fuel in my own brain to make the game run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Samsara" title="Samsara"><img alt="Samsara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Samsara">Samsara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418285/#Comment_418285" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T18:40:25+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  6:40PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group is very new to roleplaying and when we started, all most people knew was D&amp;D. Although we now have fans of Fiasco, Dungeon World, and a few others, we still have to stay within the D&amp;D/Tolkien type fantasy or completely real-to-life genres. It's just too hard to get everyone on the same page about a genre. Even a lot of the Fiasco playsets are out because we'll have a member who doesn't get wild west or cyberpunk or whatever tropes. <br/><br/>I was surprised to find out how hard Cards Against Humanity can be if you have more than one person who is not from the U.S. because a lot of the humor relies on English that you don't learn in school or inside nerd jokes. And that game doesn't even involve speaking at length like many story games do!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
