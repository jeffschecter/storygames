As a jumping-off point, however, we're creating a world-building game. It uses as its basis Microscope, combined with Dawn of Worlds and Diaspora.<br/><br/>The aim is for the group to collaborate on a history of a sword-&amp;-planet world (or a region thereof) in order to have a better handle on the world and genre before adventuring in it. Is there anything you'd like to see (or not see) in such a world-building game?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
