Personality traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, and Backgrounds. Almost like categories for potential Aspects in Fate. The analogy falls flat of course with Inspiration when compared to Fate points.<br/><br/>My D&amp;D group likes bits and pieces of Fate style games, but they're never going to change from a D&amp;D-style game to a proper story game. So, house rules. My initial thoughts are to just drop Inspiration in favor of Fate points straight across, but instead of a meager +2 on a d20 roll, replace that with the regular 5E 'grants advantage' effect of Inspiration, though I doubt we will let players give each other Fate points.<br/><br/>The hope is that the inclusion of the more wide-open Fate points coupled with the new Aspect-like personality traits subsystem will mechanically reward role-playing whilst not punishing a player for not engaging in Aspect / personality trait prompted role-playing (i.e. no compels to buy off and the like).<br/><br/>So really, I'm curious if anyone has house ruled a more Fate point style subsystem to replace Inspiration?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439348/#Comment_439348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T13:11:52+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  1:11PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What house-rules exactly?

There's really no need for compels as such, much less buying off compels. If the player wants to engage, they will and therefore also earn a Fate point, but that's likely a part of our table culture rather than widely applicable. We want to reward engaging in role-playing, but not punish players for choosing not to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
