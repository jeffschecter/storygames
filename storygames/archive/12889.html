I could see it running with different, but equally mock-heroic contests, like who gets Jim's room when Jim moves out or where <i>is</i> that secret concert, anyway?

The real <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> has 7 [six, it turns out], but that may be too many, if you want something focused, or two few, if you'd rather do something as involved as <i>Ranma 1/2</i>.<br/><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>Your series will be centered around a main protagonist who we'll call "Scott," even though they can be called anything you want in your game.  All the other PCs must be connected to Scott in some way, but it doesn't have to be directly.  If one player is Scott's gay brother Jimmy, an art school student, another player can play Jimmy's middle school boyfriend/rival, Howard, a record store clerk.  If it's not obvious already, all the characters should be hipsters or other jaded cool-losers between 15-30.<br/><br/>Character names are always ridiculous.  I'm not sure how to describe the right kind of ridiculous.  Remember this is a hipster power fantasy and I think you'll do fine.  A banal or classic-but-unusual first name followed by something that's not really a last name is a good call.  If they sound a bit like bad James Bond characters, you know you've nailed it.  Edward Gunslinger.  Ginger Soir\xe9e.  Rick Adroit.  Meredith Flagship.<br/><br/><b>The Premise</b><br/><br/>The premise of your game should fit the following format:<br/><br/>[PROTAGONIST] must [DRAMATIC VERB] [A PC]'s [NUMBER OF VOLUMES] [MALEVOLENT GENRE FICTION COMICS TRAIT] [BANAL AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL INTROSPECTIVE SAD HIPSTER COMICS STAPLE]<br/><br/><br/>For example, in the real <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> series, the premise is:<br/><br/>Scott must defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends.<br/><br/>But in your series, <i>Alicia Excelsior</i>, the premise might be:<br/><br/>Alicia must exorcise Robert's 18 demonic step-fathers.<br/><br/><br/><b>Scott</b><br/><br/>Scott is always the Spotlight Character of any particular Volume, but he does not have a potency of 3 like normal.  Instead, Scott as 0 potency and is effective in conflicts thanks solely to Fanmail, either Fanmail he earns or Fanmail that is spent on his behalf.<br/><br/><b>That's It!</b><br/><br/>Play and be merry!  The rest of <i>PTA</i> should work pretty well just as it is.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290362/#Comment_290362" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T09:04:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 9:05AM by amnesiack.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

For example, Wallace (Scott's cool gay roommate) has a psychic boyfriend who shows up briefly in volume 5. One of the rival bands, Crash &amp; the Boys (later The Boys &amp; Crash) have a song that can knock the entire audience unconscious, and develop the ability to make music without instruments.

Or perhaps not. Just as the game world accepts, without question, that there is the intrusion of video-game/dramatic logic into mundane relationships, with various implied metaphors; in that case, the structures of tabletop fantasy RPGs (with some video game infusion) can be the structure used for the interpersonal metaphors. ("Wow, Jane's new boyfriend is Half Warlock?! That's... that makes sense, actually.")<br/><br/>So Scott Pilgrim 4E: frame RP scenes (a la JWalt's PTA mod) + skill challenges where creative/ironic use of your D&amp;D powers give you bonuses, and basically freely use whatever mechanics you can to comment on the events that happen. (I will totally make you take Falling damage when you get kicked out of the band.) Create some "banter" powers or maybe some custom Themes a la Dark Sun to add some interpersonal drama to a combat, and limit it to one or two battlemap encounters per session; these should have multiple axes of fictional stakes / conditions that matter / difficult conditions. (Alternately: you can only use a power once you've used it in a RP/noncombat situation and tied it to some personality traits.)<br/><br/>Also, I had a blog post about <a href="http://games.forgreatjustice.net/2010/08/28/a-scott-pilgrim-rpgs-post-while-theres-still-time/" rel="nofollow">Scott Pilgrim and D&amp;D</a>, or basically how abrupt changes of context within a game/narrative isn't necessarily a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292306/#Comment_292306" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T14:37:41+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  2:37PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, the first time I read Scott Pilgrim volume 1, I got to the Matthew Patel fight at the end and was like, "WTF, why did this suddenly become Street Fighter; this comic sucks."

The dreams just seemed to be dreams.  When Ramona said she used a subspace pathway through Scott's head, I didn't read that literally at all, just something a cute nerdy hipster girl would say to a guy who just had a dream about her.  If those were supposed to be roadsigns, I drove right over them and barely felt any bump at all.

How did I not see that earlier, considering I had brought both up??? I'm stoopid.<br/><br/>Now I really am obsessing, but that's what I do. So, here's a proposal for a Scott Pilgrim/Danger Patrol hack.<br/>Styles will be based on typical young adult archetypes: slackers, gamers, preppies, etc.<br/>The Roles and the abilities they represent will totally be based on actual video games (names subject to change with a good suggestion, since my video game knowledge is limited nowadays):<br/> <b>Crazy Taxi</b> (replacing Flyboy) for vehicular prowess and mechanical talent.<br/> <b>Guitar Hero</b> (replacing Professor) for general coolness and musical performance.<br/> <b>Dungeon Master</b> (replacing Explorer) for giving directions, as well as finding trouble and strange things.<br/> <b>Ninja Gaiden</b> (replacing Agent) for sneaking, dirty tricks, and stabbing people in the kidney.<br/> <b>Smash Bros.</b> (replacing Warrior) for beating things up with fists, hadokens, and assorted objects.<br/> <b>Team Fortress</b> (replacing Commando) for group tactics and shooting things (likely with NERF guns...)<br/> <b>To Heart</b> (replacing Detective) for expertise in relationships, gossip, and group dynamics.<br/> <b>Tony Hawk</b> (replacing Daredevil) for physical stunts, skating, and other sport-like activities.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking that the Style would provide only stuff, and the Role would provide one specific power. Then characters would then get to draw a card with other Stuff (3 or 4 other items, sayings, motivations...), and two cards with other Power. Or perhaps add a third descriptive category, such as Personality or Hooks, that will determine additional stuff and powers, just to add flavor?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292745/#Comment_292745" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T22:24:57+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:24PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Good start, but I wouldn't constrain myself to directly replacing the eight <em>Danger Patrol</em> Roles.</p>\n<p>Also, while you're in the idea-juggling stage, how about <em>Pokemon</em>, <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292754/#Comment_292754" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T23:04:43+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 11:04PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: avram</cite>Good start, but I wouldn't constrain myself to directly replacing the eight<em>Danger Patrol</em>Roles.Also, while you're in the idea-juggling stage, how about<em>Pokemon</em>,<em>Phoenix Wright</em>, and<em>Animal Crossing</em>?</blockquote>\nI have been thinking about that, and am working on Pilgrim-appropriate Roles from video games...and ones that don't use <i>specific</i> game names...but evocative combinations of other names.<br/>Right now, I've got it as:<br/><b>Band Hero</b> for musical prowess and general coolness.<br/><b>Crazy Driver</b> for driving, stunts, sports, etc.<br/><b>Gunstar Party</b> for team coordination, aiming, and quick reactions.<br/><b>Ninja Revolution</b> for sneaking, dirty tricks, and fancy footwork.<br/><b>Puzzle Crawl</b> for finding hidden things and solving problems.<br/><b>Rumble Bros.</b> for fighting and acts of bravado.<br/>...and I'm thinking about <b>Dating Ace</b> for relationship expertise, gossip, and group dynamics (so good call on the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney mention).<br/>Good call about the Pokemon, since I need another ability...though what could Pokemon and similar games possibly represent? Trivial knowledge and obsessive collections? ...actually, that might work well in the Scott Pilgrim universe. So, maybe <b>PokeGeek</b> or <b>PokeMania</b>?<br/><br/>And now I'm thinking there'll be two meters, Aggro for action scenes (earning Power), and Stress for interludes (earning Cool). Power would be used like normal, while Cool could be spent to refresh Stuff or to give to friends as bonus dice (inspiring them with your awesomeness or something like that).

Then further define them with tags as play progresses. The traits could be, like, video game, comic book, or movie genres (Sci-Fi, Action Shooter, Puzzler, Courtroom Drama, etc.), and then add tags where appropriate (Action Shooter - Run Sideways, Hide Under Boxes, Target Their Eyes, etc.).<br/>At least, that's what comes to my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293160/#Comment_293160" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T07:46:17+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  7:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah,it sounds kinda fine. my first try would be something slightly different, but i'm not sure about it bcause it might get just too wide: instead of using the traits to cover the  "problems", the situations the character might get in, using them to cover the ways the character answers... i'm not rewarded with thebonus die given by the trait if i set on a specific task covered by the trait itself, but if, whatever is the task, i approach it in a way that reminds me of the genre my trait refers to... something like, if i have a trait called "action Shooter", or "rambo movies", it doesn't trigger when i have to shoot, or dive for cover, or whatever, but when i think and behave like that, say... i don't know.. i call for a "cover fire" by my band, that plays so hard and fast that it provides cover for my friends that need to get away from the club..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293206/#Comment_293206" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T11:51:29+00:00" title="September 13, 2010 11:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, actually got to play Misspent Youth this past weekend, it was great, etc. You could run Scott Pilgrim in Misspent Youth with pretty much no actual hacking, just flavoring in character creation.

Scott Pilgrim is fantasy fiction. As we all know (or should know by now, as I've said it dozens of times already and so has Paul Czege), fantasy is born of the friction between intense, often irrational desire and the TOTAL, UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT that is the real world.<br/><br/>I can tell you from experience that dating someone and dealing with the baggage they've accumulated from past relationships feels <i>a helluva lot</i> like having to battle their seven evil exes. And it's <i>hard</i>, dammit. I would so love if it could be handled as video game bossfights. 'Cause I'm GOOD at video games! (BAM, fantasy.)<br/><br/>You see where I'm going here? That madlib is cool but it isn't where you need to start. You have to take a real-world, emotionally-complex problem that people (especially late-teens-to-20-somethings) have to tanglewith, then transform that into a video game-esque goal, with stages and bosses.<br/><br/><b>Second thing:</b><br/>Scott Pilgrim's story isn't battling the seven evil exes. That's not the big-C Conflict in his dramatic arc. His conflict is Scott vs. Negascott. His story is the process of changing himself from a cad (an awkward, nerdy cad, but a cad nonetheless) into someone who is capable of emotional sincerity, love, and self-respect. The whole League of Evil Exes is just a trial that gives him the opportunity to improve in the ways he needs to. Until he develops those qualities, he REALLY IS just another evil ex waiting to happen.<br/><br/>Take note that the villains are all COMPLETELY self-satisfied, with no desire or motivation to improve or otherwise change in any fashion. They got powerful and decided they didn't need to level up anymore; they can stay as they are and just take what they want. It is the heroes' capacity and desire to self-improve that enables them to defeat the villains. That goes for all the heroes, even if the movie doesn't have time to play their arcs out. Keep in mind that Ramona moved to Toronto to separate herself from her past so she could begin to correct her character flaws. Also note that Matthew Patel hasn't progressed <i>since 7th grade</i> -- and  he is therefore the least of the villains.<br/><br/>Also take note that defeating enemies doesn't level Scott up. That only happens when improves himself as a person.<br/><br/>So a Scott Pilgrim (-esque) RPG needs to be about that. That's also why it needs to be late-teens-to-20-somethings, when people are obtaining their first independence and agency, and must shape themselves into the people they need to be or else wind up either a loser or evil (and people turn evil because they want to be effective). So the game needs to provide A.) a conflict that requires the protagonist(s) to build character or else turn evil or into a loser, B.) a system by which that change can be enacted, and C.) a trial (or set thereof) that provides an opportunity to resolve A via B, derived via the thing I said in the First Thing. The question is whether they will use that opportunity to change themselves for the better (and will it be enough?), or whether they'll give up/fail, and why.<br/><br/><b>Finally:</b><br/>You guys, man. I know that coming up with stat schema is fun all by itself, but you're very unlikely to come up with something useful if you do that first. You oughtn't start designing system before you've got a handle on character, setting, color, and MOST IMPORTANTLY situation -- which, in the case of story games, means big-C Conflict. Once that's in place, then it's time to start looking at system. Even if you're just hacking, you don't start even considering which games you might hack until you get to that point.<br/><br/>Given how blown away I am by Scott Pilgrim, and how deeply and <i>directly</i> it speaks to me personally, and the fact that I already went to the trouble to write this much already, I'm gonna take my own crack at it. I've got some ideas, but I'ma develop them a bit before posting about them. If you know me, you know I'm not one for hacking -- nothing ever <i>quite</i> fits enough for me (I'm going through this thread like, "PTA? Close but nah. Bliss Stage? Cool but not it at all" and so on) -- but rather for ground-up design. But expect some out-loud thinking, or even a set of scratch rules, for my Scott Pilgrim-esque RPG, coming to a Praxis near you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I don't like dice doing that.<br/><br/>No, I think the growth is going to have to be player-authored, and then the PC will have to actually <i>demonstrate</i> said growth, then the other players must somehow validate it. That's when you get XP.<br/><br/>The trick is a personality mechanic that's player-modulated, but that still calls attention to the issues and doesn't let you jump the conflict.
