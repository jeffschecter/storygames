It's looking pretty cool so far and last night I got excited about the prospect of sharing it on Story Games. Then I remembered all the fuss that went on a few months ago regarding cultural appropriation and as I much I believe that people can be way too sensitive, I do want to avoid a flame-war.<br/><br/>So, I ask for help. How do you make a game about ninja without being offensive? Sounds like a silly question, but I've seen people getting offended over stuff I never thought would be offensive.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387362/#Comment_387362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T16:26:48+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  4:26PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should ask a ninja.

Ultimately, only you can decide who and how much you're willing to offend. While it's true that people can make a big deal about anything, when you make games that involve ethnic stereotypes, I feel like you should be prepared to at least say -- if asked -- why you made certain choices. If you do that and are civil about it (maybe even if other people are less civil), it'll probably be okay. Often, with situations like this, it's not so much what you do but how you do it and how you respond to feedback. After all, maybe other folks will bring up things that will make your game better! No need to be afraid, really, as long as you don't plan to be a giant jerk to anybody who points out things that make them uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387368/#Comment_387368" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T17:08:45+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  5:08PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to Graham.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387375/#Comment_387375" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T18:25:23+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  6:25PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2012 6:26PM by Andy.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jon said, but let me throw this out:<br/><br/>However much you express unreal, ahistoric, not-grounded-in-reality messy appropriation of Ninja or Katanas, you will be no where NEAR--NO WHERE NEAR--the amount of appropriation the Japanese have done themselves in relation to Ninja and Katanas. (specifically those two items in particular: We tend to attribute all sorts of crazy bullshit to them, but so do the Japanese, times ten.<br/><br/>However, do a little research on monks (in particular) and sorcerers. Wikipedia is a great jump-off point to start your learning interestingly enough on Japanese Buddhism. I thought only updaters on comic book history and the civil war were thorough, but the kickoff for Buddhism in Japan, with its articles on the history and all the little sects, are surprisingly as thorough as you would find in a book. Dry, and devoid of real interesting narration, but (again surprisingly) good! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan</a><br/><br/>I'd like to hear more in particular about what monks do (do they fight, like shaolin/shorinji? Do they exorcise? etc). What's the setting like in general? Samurai Champloo style "hip hop Edo"? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't know any sorcerers. BTW, you're probably looking for "ONMYOJI" (taoist sorcerers), not "SHUGENJA" (hedge mage, but for some reason all western games latched on to this word). The Onmoyji/Onmyoji 2 movies are a good start to learn (and fun, culturally rich too!) but that era is about 800 years before what you're doing. Still, though. <br/><br/>Also, Mendez aka <a href="/forums/profile/Lula">@Lula</a> is a ninja. So is <a href="/forums/profile/J%C3%BCrgen_Mayer">@J\xfcrgen_Mayer</a>. If you want to ask a ninja, there they are. For real!<br/>(well, Bujinkan anyway. Not, like, IGA or KOGA or OBORO or anything. Still)<br/><br/>I'm kinda buried with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diamondsutra/tenra-bansho-zero-an-art-and-culture-rich-rpg-from" rel="nofollow"><b>my own Japanese fantasy project</b></a> to be much help right now, but at least I can help point out stuff that might be cool to add, stuff that might be cool to change, etc. Frex, I think the L5R setting is okay, and excels in its setup of things to do and people to be. However, there are some really disappointing things, like their use of language (twitch) but mostly that there is no real impact of Buddhism and Shinto in the game. Both should be driving the magic system if nothing else, and the addition of it - even a stylized slight misrepresentation (show me an anime from Japan where they don't have Christian nuns carrying around revolvers, as an example from the other side) - seems to me would have been a better choice than total silence.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387378/#Comment_387378" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T19:34:19+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  7:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Onmyoji 1 &amp; 2 are also great films.

So from that standpoint, going beyond them to the source will likely provide you with more real things, more cool things to use in your game. Don't think of it as being scared into doing research to not offend people; rather think of it as being in love with the material enough that you want to aggressively do research in order to pull out cool, cultural things (even if you bend them a bit, like in Avatar The Last Airbender, etc) to share with the world through your game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387454/#Comment_387454" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T23:19:27+00:00" title="August 18, 2012 11:19PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2012 11:24PM by UserClone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also a really good point...I mean, I can see both sides.

You find out all kinds of random little details that make your game richer, that you won't get if you stick to just one or two media sources.  It's kind of like, every translation layer you get away from the original material, the more you lose context and nuance, and the more you have to rely on other people to have done a good translation first, and you're limited to just the funnel of information that they're choosing to give you.<br/><br/>I'll also say from my own experience that having a good think about the cultural issues and where you stand on them is really helpful, if for no other reason than it's a lot less stressful to have a conversation with someone who <i>is</i> offended if you've already done some homework on the subject.  There's no right answer to have, but at least knowing something about why some people have concerns, whether you agree with them or not, can go an awful long way.  (I'll also put in there that leading that kind of discussion if you get into one with "I think people are too sensitive" will put you on the back foot.  It frames the conversation as that you're not interested in hearing about what they think before they've even opened their mouths, which is likely to steer things in the direction of a flame war.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387459/#Comment_387459" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-19T02:17:57+00:00" title="August 19, 2012  2:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, people, "research" is also tricky, and the results of research done by an amateur are often weird and laughable. Blatant cultural appropriation cases, offensive to all of humankind, invariably result not from people not doing their research, but rather from well-meaning people underestimating the complexity of the topic at hand and thinking they have done their due amount of research already. For any given topic, some of the "reference" material you can easily find around is actually prejudiced bullshit, and you probably have no way to know if you're not knowledgeable about the field already.<br/><br/>As for the specific project this thread is about, I believe the honest thing to do is recognize "ninja and samurai" as a genre to be a global pop-culture thing with little if any relationship with historical Japan at all (just like, I dunno, D&amp;D-fantasy is basically unrelated with the history and culture of Middle-ages and Renaissance Europe). Once one admits to that and states that upfront, then their intellectual honesty is warranted. The real "research" to do here then lies in movies and other pop-culture sources (Quentin Tarantino-style research): that's what to focus on to do a labor of love in this case, and please leave poor "Japan" alone for a change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387479/#Comment_387479" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-19T13:56:28+00:00" title="August 19, 2012  1:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2012 1:57PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting points from all.

Let's back up a little bit. I'm reaching out to prevent backlash, not create it. Given the generous responses to the thread, here is the useful feedback as I'm gathering it:<br/><br/> - Be upfront with your influences. Be honest and open with potentially touchy subject matter<br/> - Research is key to making a game where cultural influences are important<br/> - Research not to be politically correct, but because it can help make your game awesome and is fun<br/> - Research doesn't have to be historical - if your influence is anime, watching said anime works fine too<br/> - Amatuer research can be dangerous as well, as you might know just enough to accidently stumble into something offensive<br/> - Some japanese culture (ie ninja and samurai) has been popularized so much that it's now considered by some to be global pop-culture<br/><br/>So based off of the feedback given, some research, and some critical thinking - I made the decision to not include monks in my game. Am I being insensitive by deciding not add a certain class to the game? What feedback am I ignoring?<br/><br/>As for calling the class "sorceror" as opposed to labeling them "onmyoji" or "shugenja" - well, that's why I asked. As I said, I didn't think I'd be stepping on cultural toes by calling them "sorcerors", and I'd like it if someone were to correct me if I'm wrong. The way I see it, there are definite cultural and religious connections with onmyoji (taoism) and shugenja (Shugend\u014d) that I do not want to touch on. Calling them sorcerors was a way to pull back from the real-world culture so as not to associate either real-world religion with my game's fantasy spell-casters. Is that wrong of me?<br/><br/>To clarify, I am not looking to make my game historically accurate, culturally rich, or associate the game with any real-world religions or belief-systems. Maybe that in itself is offensive to people who don't like the idea of a game based off of a culture yet having no concrete ties to the real-world history and culture of those people, other than those the author wished to highlight.<br/><br/>Again, I am honestly trying to understand the expectations and the boundries involved here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387544/#Comment_387544" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T11:37:47+00:00" title="August 20, 2012 11:37AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, very interested in locating Blood and Honor.

I see what you're saying about not going half-way with the character class terms. I agree that this is probably not the best way to go about it - from both cultural and design-consistency standpoints. And I'm not really interested in going so generalized and globalized with the game that it ceases to be a game about samurai and ninja. <br/><br/>As mentioned, and I agree, ninja and samurai have been popularized, glamourized, fantasized, and bastardized so much by global media that there really isn't any further damage that can be done to the culture behind them. I could probably make a game about ninja pandas and nobody would bat an eye. Actually, I'm pretty sure that is already a game. But yeah, my game's vision of ninja and samurai will be tame compared to some of the popular concepts out there that are generally accepted by society. So ninja and samurai are not the issue here. That leaves sorcerors and monks.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I get the sense that people did not like the fact that I chose to drop monks and call the spell casters "sorcerers".  I'm curious as to why people find this is distasteful, lame, uncool, or bad design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387616/#Comment_387616" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T04:38:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  4:38AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>No offense Graham, but your feedback was "to ask a ninja" which I took as cheeky sarcasm, though maybe I took it wrong.</blockquote>\nIf I can make an attempt at unpacking Graham's dry British sarcasm\u2026 I think his point was, from the beginning, that if you suspect a topic to be somehow touchy then <i>polling this forum about its touchiness</i> is not the sensible thing to do about it.<br/>"What's the sensible thing to do, then?" you may rightfully ask. Well, this is just a very personal addition of mine, but I personally believe that <i>the sensible thing to do</i> is <i>to do a lot of very serious research about the topic</i>, and do it with a passion: once you have acquired a deep enough understanding of the topic (not a "polling a forum about it" level of understanding) you will presumably be able to decide for yourself what's touchy about it, to whom it concerns, what's the respectful route to take, and so on.\n<blockquote>- Amatuer research can be dangerous as well, as you might know just enough to accidently stumble into something offensive</blockquote>\nNo, I don't believe this is an accurate summary of the point I tried to make about amateur research \u2014 thus, I'll try to explain my mind more clearly.<br/>The problem with insufficient research is that when you do insufficient research you gain a superficial understanding of the subject matter.

Honestly I'd like to hear it from Graham, but assuming you're close to the mark, I'm not sure how I was supposed to ascertain all of that from one snarky little quip. Honestly, I thought he was just trying to be cute and I didn't mind the clever bit of humor until he seemed to get upset over some of my responses. I thought I was taking a step in the right direction by posting here and being open with my concern. You guys are my target audience and ultimately the ones I'm seeking to not offend. What's wrong with talking about it with you guys?<br/><br/>Thank you for the elaboration on your point regarding amateur research. Sorry I misunderstood initially. Let me modify that bulletpoint.<br/><br/> - Do serious amounts of research, then when you think you're research is done, research some more<br/><br/>Does that sum it up better?<br/><br/>I do ask that you and/or Graham respond to my earlier inquiries. It seemed pretty clear that you guys shared a negative reaction to my plan of dropping the monk from the roster and calling the spell-caster "sorcerer". As soon as I said that you guys changed your tone and I'm trying to understand why. Please respond to this if you don't mind <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a><br/><br/>I read that article. It is very interesting - thanks for sharing! I don't plan on writing any stories, so I think I'm safe from re-hashing the same old cliches, at least in a literary sense. But the main point of "Do lots of research" has sunk in.<br/><br/>So, the majority of feedback has revolved around doing plenty of research. Is research all it takes?\n<blockquote>What does the monk-priest bring or not bring to the game? </blockquote>\nIt's not that the monk-priest doesn't bring anything cool or interesting to the table. It's that this archetype is inherently associated with real-world religion. I want to avoid adding this class to my game only to have someone turn around and tell me the use of the monk is offensive because it doesn't accurately reflect what real monks were and are about.

You just want to make a fun game and not get a ton of flak over missteps you might unconsciously make. I've been there too.<br/><br/>The problem as I see is this.<br/><br/>Historically, there were groups of people about whose opinion noone cared. These people include: women, children, people physically or mentally disabled, people of colour, the poor, religious minorities. There were also people whose opinion was important out of proportion; generally white, male, Christian (whether Protestant or Catholic depends on where one lived), and rich.<br/><br/>Whenever you want to use something that symbolically "belongs" to people about whose opinion noone cared, you need to ask for their opinion first and foremost, and actually take it into consideration (and accept that there is no "the" opinion of some particular group, and that different members of the group might like/dislike different things). But the thing is to break the pattern instead of perpetuating it.<br/><br/>In this case, you're using elements of Japanese culture, but instead of asking the Japanese themselves, you're going by your own estimate of whether the elements are generic enough or not (afaik you're not Japanese), and also asking your peers who (it's my impression) are mostly not Japanese either. So you're following the pattern of the problem to the dot. Break it. Actually ask a ninja.<br/><br/>As to what else you need apart from research: I'd say empathy, and understanding that there is no easy, convenient shortcut around deep seated cultural problem of discrimination, and courage to tackle that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ritualz" title="Ritualz"><img alt="Ritualz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ritualz">Ritualz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391806/#Comment_391806" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T15:32:27+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  3:32PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, the majority of feedback has revolved around doing plenty of research.

You could contact an instructor at a ninjitsu dojo and ask to buy them lunch and talk about authenticity and representation. If they were busy, maybe they'd put you in contact with someone who was knowledgeable.<br/><br/>-There are Japanese scholars of history who've spent a great deal of time studying the history of ninja, and so they have both a lived knowledge of their own culture and a strong academic knowledge of this one specific, oft-bastardized element of their culture.<br/><br/>-You maybe have some Japanese friends. If so, you can start with a casual conversation with them about their opinions and perspectives, if they're willing to have that conversation with you. They don't owe you anything, which might mean that they don't want to get into the topic with you. They also represent only one viewpoint, and cannot speak for all Japanese people. ie, their opinion is not The Japanese Opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer" title="swavomeer"><img alt="swavomeer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/642/n9D042GBVCM5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer">swavomeer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391842/#Comment_391842" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T02:48:31+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  2:48AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or you may just visit this site: <a href="http://askaninja.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://askaninja.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391868/#Comment_391868" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T11:24:42+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 11:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 12:07PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys. I kinda tried to put this thread to rest, but since it came back up, I figure I should respond. If you read earlier up in the thread, I came to the personal conclussion that the iconic figures of samurai and ninja were as much up for creative grabs as knights and assassins are seeing as how they have become part of the globalized culture much having to do with Japanese arts and media from the past century. The reason I bring that up is because that kind of makes "ask a ninja" a moot point. Further, I currently know two people that are technically considered ninjas and neither of them are Japanese nor do they have any strong opionions on this subject. According to them, it's whatever. The real question as far as I'm concerned became how to include sorcerers in a game about samurai and ninja. Some suggest sticking with a modern cultural archetype (onmyoji) while others suggest divorcing the whole cast from their Japanese roots, which I'd rather not since it then ceases to be a game about ninja and samurai which is the goal here. In the end, I did more research on onmyoji and went with that term to be consistant. \n<blockquote>No and honestly, as a PoC, I find these discussions extremely distasteful and your flippant attitude worrying.
