The founders are passing on.<br/><br/>My "Pour Out a Little Liquor" story: I had purchased a few RPGs, like Star Frontiers, Paranoia and the like. I played them occasionally, and was interested in doing more with them: RPGs were far more interesting than schoolwork, frex. However, no existing game was really grabbing at my heartstrings. I wasn't too into comics, so the supers-themed games really didn't interest me much. D&amp;D Red Box was quaint, but ultimately not all that interesting to me aside from the esoteric stuff (like the contents of the Master's Box). Paranoia was great in one-shots, but not much more. Star Frontiers was my go-to game, and while I dug the stories we made, I kept my ear to the floor for other things.<br/><br/>I bought TMNT in the late 80s, read it through, and both played in and ran some hot, Hot games. There are very few character generation systems that interested me as remotely as making characters with TMNT. Hands down the most fun I'd have making characters until I stumbled onto Over the Edge, so like over a decade. My most memorable character was a wolf-man who worked for the government.  We played TMNT in those days as what one would almost imagine as a near-modern day version of Justifiers (before Transmatt technology). That was at least one good, solid year of gaming right there.  <br/><br/>Also, because of TMNT, when I moved to Chicago in the early 90s and went to a new high school, it was that game that helped me quickly find other gamers and get right into playing right away.<br/><br/>My best friend Drew ran and played a fuckload of AMBER at Rutger's University when he went in the mid-90s, and told me all sorts of crazy stories of the 7+ people games run in dorm rooms, all participants being hot and geeky co-eds. I wish I had a chance to fall in with that game more.<br/><br/>Anyone else have a story tangentially related to Eric Wujcik?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149455/#Comment_149455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T18:26:11+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  6:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About a year or so ago, we were interviewing for a Senior Designer at the computer games company I was working at.  And I got assigned to interview a guy who was visiting from Asia.  Evidently he was visiting companies up and down the West Coast as he was moving back to the States.<br/><br/>His name didn't ring a bell, but when I was interviewing him he was telling some interesting stories about role-playing games that he liked to play with his friends.  I thought the whole concept of "diceless" was still a little weird, but I asked him what kinds of games he liked to play and if he had ever heard about The Forge.  He chuckled a little and said that he mostly liked to make his own games to play.<br/><br/>I walked out of that interview thinking that he was a very cool guy and I'd like to game with him, but probably not the best fit for our company at the time.  And alas, he ended up at another company and moved back to the US, I believe.<br/><br/>The next day I was mentioned his name to a friend who was like "You interviewed Eric Wujcik?!?  What, you never heard of Amber Diceless??!?"<br/><br/>"Well I guess I *heard* of it.  But who knew THAT WAS THE GUY?"<br/><br/>So there ya have it.  My minor brush with Eric.  Was very sorry to hear he was sick and to hear of his passing.  Really nice guy.  <br/><br/>Eric, I hope you know I played my first diceless game at GPNW, and it ROCKED.<br/><br/>-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149489/#Comment_149489" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T21:30:38+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  9:30PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TMNT was the first game I ever played were we actually understood the rules.

From what people from the Ambercons told me, he was a really cool guy.
