                    I've commented for years that one of the advantages of working on a big established game line is that it brings me into contact with people who genuiinely, truly, demonstrably are having fun in ways that don't seem at all possibly fun to me, but are for them. But of course that's not the only way to get the experience. I thought it might be a fun exercise to tally the dichotomies where it seems to you like nobody on one side could really mean it, but you have good reason to believe they do.<br/><br/>For me this is a big one:<br/><br/>Details invented as you go feel just as solid and real for game purposes as details prepared beforehand or gathered from an external source / Details invented as you go feel very different and substantially less real than ones prepared beforehand or etc etc. <br/><br/>I'm on the right-hand side of this one, and I find - on a deep emotional, personal level - the left-hand view as strange as the belief of some people I know that they have genuinely non-human souls, particularly if those souls originated in what I think of as fantasy races. I don't let this stop me from deal with it on an intellectual basis, because I can see that it exists, but it's something I just don't <i>get</i> way down.<br/><br/>And of course I know others feel the same way about my tilt. Keeps life interesting, it does, to know that I'm someone else's alien, too.<br/><br/>Let's see, other good ones....<br/><br/>Whatever the central conflicts of your game are, they are best served by mechanics that detail them and put them at the center of resolution. / Whatever the central conflicts of your game are, they are best served by being left to player and character choice, with the mechanics dedicated to resolving the incidentals around them.<br/> <br/>Implicit in this one is a whole constellation of views about social relationships, the nature of conflict, etc etc. I'm less strongly tilted on this one, but have friends I deeply respect more thoroughly at each pole, and sometimes end up feeling like we're <i>all</i> Martians on this bus.<br/><br/>Anyone else got something you want to confess you simply don't get in that "yes, I understand this in my heart" way?<br/><br/>AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm not here looking to change anyone's mind.

                            Naw, I get you, all in fun and all that. It is interesting to lay dichotomies bare, as from that point they align towards certain games: Makes it easier to spot games that would and wouldn't work for your mindset.<br/><br/>For your first dichotomy, for me it really depends on the game, but I usually dwell somewhere between "on the teetering edge of the left side of the see-saw" to "right around the middle, possibly a smidge to the right".<br/><br/>For your second dichotomy, I'm... hmmm. I'm <i>open</i>.  That is, I'll give a game on the "left side" a try, just as I would a game on the "right side".  And it totally depends on my mood. It's like being in a board game club, and deciding between Settlers, Tikal, Gin Rummy or Tigris and Euphrates: totally depends on my mood and what kinds of games I've played up until that point.  But I usually mix them, about half and half. Well, more like "70-30" these days, but still. Campaign games tend to the right side, one shot or mini-campaigns (which I play a lot these days) are on the left.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of another fun dichotomy. Maybe, to riff on your first one,<br/><br/><i>"I like games that come with a pre-packaged, detailed setting." vs "I like open games which I can use to make my own settings."</i><br/>(I swing back and forth here, although we do often play homebrew settings a lot)<br/><br/><i>"I like games where the GM totally owns the story" vs "I like games where the players have a responsibility to own of the story"</i><br/>(I swing a little here, but as a GM I'm on the right side of this, because my job keeps me busy as fuck and when I get to gaming the last thing I want to do is be responsible for Everything. My players used to ALL be solidly on the left side, but after time they've moved somewhere around the middle)<br/><br/>One I see on RPGNet every now and then:<br/><i>"I like to roll 1-3 dice per roll" vs "I like to roll lots of dice per roll"</i><br/>(I'm on the right side here for the most part)                        </div>

<p>I love the "I want to have everyone supporting me in my goals for the story" vs. "I want people to oppose my goals for the story, so I fight to earn every victory" dichotomy.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people on both sides saying to the others "Oh, you don't <strong>mean</strong> that ... it's just hyperbole" and no matter how clearly people state their claims, the other side is <em>unable</em> to see it as a possible thing.</p>

                            Ohhh, riffing off of Tony:<br/><br/><i>"My character is an extension of myself in this world" vs "My character is an object to be manipulated for the story".</i><br/><br/>I swing, oddly enough, both ways on this, depending on the game played really.  I favor the right side a little more, but the last time (both as in "the last time I played" and "the last time I will EVER play") I played Conan OGL, it took us four hours to create our characters (4-5 players, two copies of the book).  So we wanted to do more "Conan Storylike" things like jump into battle, beat shit down, fuck and drink and yell at everything in town, be it beneficial or detrimental, but we soon clammed up and played it "safe", staying out of a lot of conflict... because the rules were so beyond what we were used to in terms of complication that we just didn't want to engage in them.  We had four Conans that wouldn't fight or get in trouble because we didn't want to buck the system and/or die and have to spend another X hours making a new character! <br/><br/>But the above dichotomy is the one of the Immersionists (if I'm reading it right) vs, say, people who roleplay their character, and yet want to see them fail at "important" tasks every now and then to see how it affects the story.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            This is great, Bruce, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
One I get caught on is "I can't understand how anyone could play...a cross gender character, multiple characters,etc" vs. "As long as you can understand a character anyone can play anything &amp; any number."  I'm on the right hand and when I talk to people who really truly have the experience of the left, I just am dumbfounded. But just cause it isn't that way for me don't make it not so.<br/>
<br/>
The "character as extension of self/object to be manipulated" one always strikes me as a misreading on both sides--the extension of one's self is always being manipulated for story--you say you want a character to do something because that's what you want to happen--and also, if the character is for the story, then it is an extension of your desires in the game world etc.  Although I may be thinking of a related dichotomy, of looking at character as doing what it's intrinsic nature would have it do, vs. authoring it for story.                        </div>

That's the chestnut.<br/>
<br/>
One I run into with my group is (a) passing notes and private conferences vs. (b) open disclosure of motivation/intention, trusting to player discretion in coloring declarations.<br/>
<br/>
With (b), you can go two main ways: (1) keep doing what you were planning unless a wrinkle comes out in play, and (2) aggravate the calamity.<br/>
<br/>
(b) is part and parcel to outsourcing NPC control to players [weird, highly localized time-space distortion occurs, indicating non-traditional RPG think]; otherwise, they're unsure how to choose for them.                        </div>

(a) Every character is reasonably balanced, even from PC to NPC, and the GM has to approve high-level spell choice, acquisition of powerful magic items, etc. vs. (b) it goes from Frodo to Gandalf; you can have whatever you need to get you off, 'cause we admit, that's all we're doing, anyway.<br>

(a) Dumb failure, ultimately expressed as meaningless death, is at best a colorful threat used to create player buy-in; if the dice misbehave, these consequences are fiated away, vs. (b) severity of consequence follows from the culture/situation; when the dice speak, that settles it; time to [Matrix agent transformation] take over a hitherto innocuous NPC, or introduce your new character.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Emily, the most extreme form I've seen of the left side is one guy who felt it was morally wrong, deeply perverted and flat out abusive to play a 'blond, hot, nineteen year old girl' if the player was not all of those things.  Given that he was largely roleplaying out having sex, it was a pretty emotive issue for him.  And he just couldn't cope with the idea that other people thought he was the freak.  Poor boy.  Talk about a clash of dichotomies!<br><br/>One that really bugs me, because I'm far out one end, is:<br/><br/>As a player of a PC I am not responsible for contributing to the fun.  /  I am responsible for contributing to my own and other people's fun.<br/><br/>I'm hard on the right there, and get rabidly angry at adults who say things like 'but I don't want to take responsibility for that!'<br/><br/>--<br/>Claire                        </br></div>

<p>Basically, the implication here is wrong.  There is no one in the world that does not think that the core, central conflicts of a game should not be centered around player and character choice.  I think that the dichotomy that you're looking at are "some people trust textual rules vs. some people distrust textual rules," rather than anything about whether or not player choice is meaningful.  Almost every argument I've seen for strong mechanics is centered around the idea that they make player choice more meaningful, not less.</p>

<p>This is really strange to me, because I see these two statements as almost identical.  To whit: I see myself, in the real world, as an object to be manipulated to my own benefit.  If I play a character in a game, and I'm playing that as an avatar, hardcore, then I'm constantly looking, in the character's eyes, at his place in the world and how to better himself.</p>
<p>I think the direction this might be pointing is:</p>
<p><em>My character is a completely closed entity who makes his own decisions regardless of my own desires</em> vs. <em>I make decisions for my character based on all the constraints of what we want out of the game, including but not limited to character integrity</em></p>
<p>Is that right?</p>

                            Ben, the thing is, some people (I'm sometimes one of them) genuinely feel that the most important choices should not be constrained by randomization at the moment of crisis. They feel this for different reasons, not all of them overlapping much. I bring this up because I know that folks who see good mechanics as crucial to the fullest development of the agenda leading up to whatever those choices is have a tough time believing that others really, really don't see it that way. They don't want better mechanics, for some things - they want no mechanics there, except what defines the situation around the crisis. <br/><br/>Likewise, some people's desire is exactly to experience things as the character would, to the degree that this is feasible, and not to constrain its experience to fit (for instance) the acts of a Shakespearean tragedy or a Syd Field screenplay. That is their desire, and it is fulfilled when the character's choices and experiences feel like they have a thread of internal consistency emerging from the character's identity rather than external formulae. Your phrasing is perjorative in precisely the way I sought to avoid.                        </div>

                            Bruce, <br/><br/>That one feels to me like the "I want mechanics that cover the important things because it makes our system more in line with the game in the book" vs "I want mechanics that focus on the unimportant things because it lets us use our personal system (lumpley system definition of system) to deal with the important things." <br/><br/>That's one I actually feel the pull of both sides of, depending on where I am. I love games like Dogs where the system is everywhere and all encompasing -- especially when playing in hard situations with people who may not always be comfortable with everything going on. OTOH, when I'm playing in solo games with Mo or my brothers, I often go almost freeform and have a preference for mechanics that are non obstrusive because our social system is so finely honed that we don't need mechanics for large parts of what we do. <br/><br/>On the character front, one I see is; "I play my character as my imago: my ideal self in the world to give me a voice into the SIS" vs "I play my character as an avatar to let me experience things I wouldn't want to experience" vs "I play my character to construct a story" in a three-way brawl. <br/><br/>As others have pointed out, I don't think these are always in competition or always contradict each other. However, I do see them cropping up in play and in discussions in ways that cause confusion. Someone that plays an imago, for example, will get insulted when you say something negative about their character -- as you're saying that the player sucks. OTOH, someone playing their character to construct a brutal and challenging story may get pissed if you don't say negative things about their character -- as not reacting means you find their story boring.<br/><br/>See me, I don't play a character to experience the character. I play a character to tell a story through the character. Mo plays characters to experience the character, but not as an extension or idealization of part of herslef. I have other people in my group who used to (mostly past tense at this point) play characters that were nothing other than their idealized self. The conflict those different focuses could bring to game, and discussion about game, could get pretty harsh.                        </div>

                            Bruce, you're veering wildly here.  Are we talking about mechanics or randomization?<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are people who do want want any mechanics to touch their most important choices (heck, I can be one of these people).  They don't trust the mechanics to have any part in their decision.<br/>
<br/>
That's why I phrased as "distrust of textual mechanics" for these folks and "trust of textual mechanics" for other folks.  Your basic phrasing that some people want their important decisions "decided by dice" is just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
(My use of "textual" is for bizarre theoretical reasons -- even taking actions "in character" is directly supported by a mechanic ("you say what your character does and says," in this case) and I wanted to be clear that those weren't the sorts of mechanics that we were discussing.  It's secondary.  If it offends you, ignore it.)<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I fail to see how my second phrasing is perjorative.  I play both of these ways, largely depending on the mechanics that we're using, so I don't really see either side as "the good guys" here.<br/>
<br/>
(your conception of what the other type of play entails is, likewise, kinda wierd, but I'll sport you that: unlike the misconception I'm talking about wrt the first pair, it doesn't matter too much the conversation at this point.)<br/>

                            I think that the cross-gender character issue is really just an extension of the character-as-self thing.  People have the assumption that you can't ever completely identify with someone of the opposite gender.  Which seems odd - heterosexuality is rather popular.                        </div>

                            Okay, let's try this again now that I've had some sleep.<br/><br/>(At least) four kinds of factors shape characters' options and therefore players' choices at any particular moment: the web of social, player-level preferences, style of decision-making, and so on; definitions established about the game world and its behavior before the moment (character traits and their levels, etc.); randomization, whether expressed through dice, coin-flipping, card-turning, or whatever; and player-level choice in the allocation of resources like plot points, whether spent simply, bid in challenges, or whatever.<br/><br/>(This is NOT exhaustive or super-rigorous. I'm just trying to sketch out enough to illustrate the point of the moment.)<br/><br/>I don't think I'm being unfair (seriously, I'm trying not to be) when I say that a driving concern of Forge-influenced design is finding the right mechanics to go with the key challenges of a new game - in practice, a matter of setting the prior definitions to point toward desired activity, and then some mix of randomization and player-level activity in those challenges. You've earned your currency, you spend it and consult fortune as is appropriate, outcomes follow, as expressed in the way that game sets up. This leaves out a lot, but I don't think there's anything misleading in it. I'll take correction, with the caveat that I'd want a better exposition not to be any longer than this, because my <i>real</i> point is actually elsewhere.<br/><br/>The thing I wanted to point at is the fact that some people actually don't want any of that. They don't want to be steered toward some types of conflicts, nor to have to engage in player-level activity that deals with things outside their characters' perceptions (spending drama points, contesting for narrative control, etc.), nor to do any but the simplest randomization and resolution. The right system for them is driven only by the prior definition of characters' abilities and the social, player and GM judgment as to appropriate and interesting outcomes. <br/><br/>I find that this is one of the strongest "you don't really mean that?!?" encounters, for folks who feel very strongly about one side or the otehr. Just recently I saw it set off some rather dull arguments on RPG Net between folks like my friends John Snead and Plume and a few folks who really weren't getting their point. It's a genuine "you're from another world" moment, when you're on one end and discover that someone is actually serious about it on the other end - informed, aware of the alterantives, and consciously choosing this other way.                        </div>

I've always framed this as "trust of textual system" versus "distrust of textual system."  Does this seem like a decent phrasing to you?*<br/>
<br/>
What I'm trying to say is that phrasing it as "mechanics decide" versus "player decides" is just pretty inaccurate.<br/>

Some folks who consider thematic play a priority say that those who do not have system to decide conflicts go be fiat, which has become a codeword for bullying and dysfunction.<br/>

                            Hey, Bruce.  Here's where my "textual system" verus "non-textual system" distinction is useful.<br/>
<br/>
"Textual system" is the elements of the system which are written down in a book.<br/>
<br/>
"Non-textual system" is the elements of the system which are not written down in a book.<br/>

                            Bruce, <br/><br/>Right. That's why I usually say "mechanics" to mean the procudures in the text, and "system" to mean the things that the game actually uses to decide what happens. I don't yet have a word I like for "things that are part of the system that aren't part of the explicit mechanics" because "social system" is usually used to mean social mechanics from the rules, and because some games use a "social system" as a mechanical issue. So, it lurks there in the poorly defined category. <br/><br/>For now I'll just point at this, and say "the dark blue part in the red circle." <br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=23" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysrules.gif" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Some people want most of the game to be that dark blue part. Some people want all of it to be the green part. A few people may even want it to all be the lighter blue part not in the red circle -- but I know fairly few of those. <br/><br/>Everyone has a system to decide what happens. How transparent, understood, and based on the mechanics in the book the system is -- that changes a lot from group to group. Vincent, in the article linked above, makes his argument that the more the mechanics and system are the same the more fun there is to be had. This is true for him. It is double plus untrue for others.<br/><br/>So Vincent wants this: <br/><br/><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysideal.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>This represents a game where all the rules are the mechanics from the book. What you do is what the book says, exactly. <br/><br/>Others want this: <br/><br/><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysgurpsrules.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>What this represents is pretty typical RPG play -- where the GM and or Players ignore large parts of the mechanics and replace them with the social/consensual aspect of their system. That's what I was talking about in another thread when I said some people want a game whose mechanics only deal with the unimprotant things so they can use their personal system to deal with the important things -- they like and are comfortable with the dark blue, and want to stay over there. <br/><br/>And I suppose some folks might want this: <br/><br/><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysfreerules.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>It could be true. I just don't see why. BUt hey, it could be true even though I can't see it!                        </div>

                            A teeny weeny nothingburger little sticking-up-for-myself:<br/><br/>Brand says "Vincent, in the article linked above, makes his argument that the more the mechanics and system are the same the more fun there is to be had." But actually, that depends <i>overwhelmingly</i> on how fun the mechanics are. See, for instance, my little Ars Magica animation in the comments to that post.                        </div>

                            Right right. Sorry Vincent, I was trying to stick to the basics and missed that point.                        </div>
