We are playing a RISUS-based supers game based on the idea behind "Necessary Evil", where they are the bad guys who have to save the world from Something Worse. However, this group has recently become a half-RPG/half-talk group. No longer able to focus at great length on gaming, we often do boardgames, talk about politics/coding/science/culture, watch videos, etc. To that end, gaming has retreated a bit to more of a bi-weekly thing, and in turn the heavy gamers in the group have begun hanging out other nights/weekends to get their game on more.<br/><br/>Bi-Weekly: We just came back together for the new year. Last session we played Panty Explosion/Star Wars. Next week we meet to discuss which game to play next and make characters (we roll in mini-campaigns running 2-4 months, sometimes longer). On the table is nWOD Vampire or nWOD Vampire: ROME, some playtests, and maybe a heavy game or two. I will probably do my World War Z game with this group.<br/><br/>Shadowrun: We've got two sessions of <a href="http://sombraconsole.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Sombra Console</a> down, and a third is happening in two weeks. This game is psychoawesome, and is making me love Shadowrun back and forth. I'm a great faceman/decent hacker, and Eric P is running it.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 3E: The monthly D&amp;D game (using E6) continues in two weeks. We fought and subdued an evil mage with plans to bring hell to earth; next episode is going to be us bringing him back to town for justice, lots of side quests, then investigating an evil ice worm cult. My Ice Elf is level 1 Spirit Shaman, Level 2 Thief. <br/><br/>Other: And I'm still meeting every other weekend or so to throw down with one-shots and mini-campaigns. Currently planning on soon throwing down some Red Box Hack, Tenra, and Lacuna over the next month or so.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120804/#Comment_120804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T16:28:19+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  4:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only regular game I've got going on right now is our Primetime Adventures <i>No Man's Land</i> game, which should happen every 2-3 weeks.

I look forward to giving it another try with a few modifications based on our discoveries of how it worked in play, which was still quite well, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>However, when (hopefully soon) we start up something longer-term again I got the rest of my group on board to give In Nomine a whirl. And I've got plans to try out some fiddly relationship-map-generating things before play, too, which I look forward to seeing the results of.

We're in the last legs of the campaign, almost 21 and almost facing Dragotha. At it's best it has been quite a good campaign, but lately it has bogged down and isn't as fun as it used to be. It's not that many sessions yet and we might as well finish as it's more satisfying to have foiled Kyuss evil plans than just quitting. The next will either be the last 3.5 campaign (unless 4th ed is truly shite) or a Warhammer campaign. Currently playing a Fighter/Warblade TWF that's great fun.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu: Tatters of the King. I used to be burned out on CoC, but this campaign has brought back what was fun with it. We're all very experienced CoC playes as well as the GM so we manage to hold the mood as well as going in both guns blazing. The GM added a lot, so although we have played in a year and a half we're just at chapter three. Tatters is centered on the Hastur Mythos and is up there with the great campaigns like Masks of Nyarlathotep and At the Mountains of Madness. My Hungarian Anthropologist is still quite sane although he has a looser trigger finger on his hunting rifle.<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday: Rinn, en kampanjesetting for dj\xe6rvravar (Rinn a campaign setting for hardasses). Rinn was originally a campaign world we made over at rollespill.net for a bit of Redbox nostalgia. We mixed up a lot of D&amp;D'isms in a Norse setting framework which got more and more Norse elements as went on. One of us were very vocal about not wanting to play D&amp;D so we landed on TSOY and has played a couple of sessions with it. Although I've had TSOY for a couple of years now, it was the first time I played it and although I was concerned it was not "crunchy" enough, I was pleasantly surprised and have come to love "Bringing Down the Pain".<br/><br/>I've tested Spirit of the Century twice and I'm probably going to GM a mini-campaign in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120858/#Comment_120858" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T21:48:52+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  9:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless any of you live in Gothenburg, Sweden, nothing. <br/>Anyone?<br/>Please?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Haakon" title="Haakon"><img alt="Haakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Haakon">Haakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120859/#Comment_120859" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T21:54:51+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  9:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Gothenburg had a solid gaming environment, with GothCon as the great event?

The PCs have returned from their visit to Elysium (the dimensional hypercomputer that the gods use to maintain the multiverse) only to find that the Holy Velkan Empire has declared war on the Northstar Alliance. Although I needed the break, I can't wait to see how the Dimension War story arc plays out.<br/><br/>I want to squeeze some more indie gaming in here and there, as well as try using Primetime Adventures to run a Divine Machine side-story about the Dimensional Police (think of the guys from Jet Li's movie The One) being caught up in the unfolding Dimension War, or possibly about the Northstar Alliance's Interdimensional Magic Task Force. Either way it probably won't really get moving until Spring though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120876/#Comment_120876" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T02:26:11+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weekly, GURPS, the second year of my current ongoing campaign, which is about a struggling mercenary company in a renaissance / fantasy / aztec world recovering from a major war.<br/><br/>Recently I was at Nerdinburgh and played Shock and Sorcerer and Sword.<br/><br/>In the next few months, leading up to our annual convention in Edinburgh (Conpulsion), I'll certainly be playing Solipsist (which should be out for Conpulsion), and hopefully also In a Wicked Age at least once.<br/><br/>I'll also be in a Changeling The Lost LARP about once a month much to my horror!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120880/#Comment_120880" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T02:44:48+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:44AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Running two BW games, one a monthly get-together which has been slow to get back off the ground since Xmas, and I'm running a weekly BW game set in a city heavily influenced by A|State and using a relationship map based on Joseph Conrad's The secret agent.

I'm disregarding combat manouvers and a lot of the finicky "If exposed to sunlight, you will burn at a rate of X times Y" stuff, and suddenly it is a far simpler and more beautiful game.

Winter huh?  I started playing in a very traditional group with some very old friends (mostly because Joanna wants to spend more time with her new neice and that's basically where the game happens).  I am jumping into a bunch of rotating games they have going on.  I made a Deadlands character - a little person huckster posing as a snake oil salesman.  I will be playing a ball-to-the-wall Spartan in a nWoD Ancient Greece game.  Thus far I played a spymaster in a Lord of the Rings game.  it went pretty well.  The game was pretty focused on me and the GM was open to some subtle play techniques so it has a lot of promise.  That's my Sunday night.<br/><br/>I've played two Psi-Run games this year and need to complete a Mountain Witch game soon.<br/><br/>Joanna wants to start a <a href="http://shadowgirlscomic.com/" rel="nofollow">Shadowgirls</a> game using True20.  Apparently they are working on a True20 supplement for the comic.<br/><br/>A small group I am in have all decided that they dug our "Play in the World of Near using Psi-Run" session enough that we're going to take these characters and play a Shadow of Yesterday campaign.  I think it's going to be great fun!<br/><br/>My Monday group played BW and some WIZARDs playtests.<br/><br/>We recently ran through Survivors (my Contenders variant) twice and Saturday we got to play some Contract Work.  Both were blazing successes and I simply can't wait for Dreamation (where they will be next run)!<br/><br/>I think that covers most of Winter '08.  We really missed not doing 30 Days of gaming this year but my buddy Matt is in Iraq.  His wife says she's going to try and do it with us next year.
