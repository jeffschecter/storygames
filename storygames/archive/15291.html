I did some digging, and it turns out that the Valar put a ban on wizards trying to rule the Free Peoples; their goal must be to guide, to aid, not to govern. That's why Gandalf doesn't just fix all their problems for them; that's why he uses his mind control powers so sparingly, and so on.<br/>Here's the question: all previous Lord of the Rings games forbidden players from playing Wizards, likely on the grounds that they'd be too powerful. But if that's not so much of a concern, then would playing a Wizard take too much attention away from the struggles and trials of mortal (and Elvish) PCs? <br/><br/>I think it'd be interesting to have the Istari option be available, with some framing in place on how to be responsible to the White Council, the repercussions of abusing one's powers, etc. But it could be like the Jedi and <i>Star Wars</i> - - a lot of the story gets wrapped up in stuff that only really concerns the Jedi, and that's kind of what <i>Star Wars</i> is about. By contrast, the inner lives of Wizards are not at all the focus in Lord of the Rings. <br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore" title="Nicholas Moore"><img alt="Nicholas Moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore">Nicholas Moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347382/#Comment_347382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T10:37:53+00:00" title="October 31, 2011 10:37AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,   <br/>\n   I think that this question hinges upon whether the Istari appropriately reflect your themes of "honor and justice and loyalty and sacrifice," and I don't believe that allowing players to play Istari would compromise them.  There certainly is a lot to mine in playing what amount to angels put in frail forms, forbidden to use their immortal power to solve mortal problems.  How do you, knowing you could solve something with tremendous magic, instead find a way to help people help themselves?  This would all be very exciting to explore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, another concern I might have going into a game would be what "playing an Istari" meant.  Can I create my own Angel-Wizard?  Am I bound to the five Istari mentioned by Tolkien (and I cannot remember whether there were only five ever sent).  Playing one of the unnamed wizards sent to the east is certainly different from playing Gandalf himself (or Saruman or Radagast for that matter).  Frankly I would be uninterested in playing Gandalf, mostly because I would find it too hard to play against the contraints of his character already set out before me.  How do I breathe life into a character that has already been done justice to by Tolkein himself?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347397/#Comment_347397" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T13:29:13+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  1:29PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2011 1:49PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's excellent!<br/>Thanks, Nick! This bit was especially awesome: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nicholas Moore</cite>There certainly is a lot to mine in playing what amount to angels put in frail forms, forbidden to use their immortal power to solve mortal problems.  How do you, knowing you could solve something with tremendous magic, instead find a way to help people help themselves?  This would all be very exciting to explore.</blockquote>\nDamn, I should put that on the back cover of this thing, if I ever finish it and print it up ^____^<br/><br/>That being said, let's answer your question. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nicholas Moore</cite>That said, another concern I might have going into a game would be what "playing an Istari" meant.  Can I create my own Angel-Wizard?</blockquote>\nMy instinct is to say, "Yes. But it's not that you can; rather, you must. Precisely to avoid all the baggage that accompanies playing well-known, well-established characters, I think I'm going to have every campaign of this game make up their own Istari as needed. I think I'll play up their divinity, and frame them as being a choir of divine beings that straddle two worlds - - and their earthly identities just aren't all that important. <br/><br/>Maybe do it like this: for starters, when you begin a new campaign, the whole group discusses where the timeline should start. Everything beyond that point is erased from the "lore" (the movies, books, etc.) and we pretend like it is completely unwritten, precisely so we have enough creative breathing room to write over it in the course of play. <br/>Second thing: the Istari themselves only remember/know the mortal names of those Istari whom they are currently working with, or have worked with before. When the mortals coming 'round in need of a Wizard ask, "Say, where's that fellow in the blue hat? Tall chap, likes to smoke? Surely you Wizards all know each other," the player playing an Istari can cheerfully reply, "Sorry, don't know him. I can be of help, though," <br/>(all the while, he's privately thinking, "Bloody hell, you grubby mortals, I can't tell half of you apart from the rest! Now, if you were radiant beacons of heavenly power, I could tell one face from another. Hang on - give me a drawing of this blue-hat-fellow's Kyrian aura, would you? That'd be something, at least.)<br/><br/>I think I want to really play up the otherworldly perspective of the Istari. Hey, how amusing would it be if they actually had to concentrate hard to tell their own kind from mortals? Maybe the Wizards take the shapes of old, long-bearded men so they can at least narrow it down a bit. Ha!<br/><br/>Seriously, though, this helps a lot!<br/><br/>EDIT: Crap! I didn't answer your question! What I meant to say was, "When you start a new campaign, you come up with names, themes, and personalities for any Istari that are encountered. They will be Wizards, like we're used to, but they are not Gandalf or Saruman or Radagast or any of them. They are the particular Istari that were sent to Arda in THIS version of the tales, more importantly in YOUR version of the tales!" <br/>Yes.... excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore" title="Nicholas Moore"><img alt="Nicholas Moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore">Nicholas Moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347407/#Comment_347407" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T14:26:22+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  2:26PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, <br/>\n  Glad to be of service! I agree with your approach, it certainly solves the problems I addressed of constraint.  A couple of further questions:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume one can play the myriad mortal (and as you distinguished, aptly, elven) peoples of the Middle-Earth.  Can you play the Valar?  How about other Maiar who interacted in mortal affairs, like Sauron?  Could I, for instance, say that I wanted to play a Maia who took on a guise other than a wizard to walk among the peoples of Middle-Earth?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what you say about:<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: Zac in VirginiaMaybe do it like this: for starters, when you begin a new campaign, the whole group discusses where the timeline should start.

I've always had some difficulty with Middle-Earth as a setting: either feeling too constrained by what's been written, or feeling as though the only stories left to tell are unimportant; after all, the goods ones have been written.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour idea of ignoring cannon beyond the point in time the game is started shows the potential to overcome this problem (which I suspect I'm not alone in?).  I would love to hear more about the game's techniques (now, and as it develops), to see how you maintain the essence of Tolkien outside of Tolkien's cannon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347420/#Comment_347420" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T15:09:00+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  3:09PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in this too. My planned approach for my TOR campaign is to say that everything in The Hobbit is more or less true (although Bilbo is perhaps a somewhat unreliable narrator, given how incompetent the dwarves seem to be). But only the broadest sweeps of The Silmarillion can be relied upon, and nothing in LotR is guaranteed at all beyond the basic geography of Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>So Bilbo really did find a magical ring that confers invisibility. No guarantees about it being the One Ring, however. Moria is indeed empty of dwarves for some reason, but you'll have to go there to find out what that reason is. And for sure everyone agrees that Smaug was killed by an arrow from Bard the Bowman. May or may not be the case. <br/><br/>And the biggie - who is the Necromancer??

Eru agreed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>He fought the Balrog, a Maiar spirit (same order of magnitude as Sauron) hand-to-hand, and eventually threw him off a mountain-top to kill him.</blockquote>\nBalrogs are of the same order of spirits as Sauron, but nowhere near him in power. He was one of the first; created by Eru himself. The Balrogs were lesser creations of Melkor. Incidentally, the Istari are also Maiar, but among the weaker members of that order.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sorry, not trying to be a jerk!

Re-imagining Gandalf's skill as a negotiator (and his position as a known/feared? personality) as a feat of magic certainly belittled both Gandalf and Wormtounge.  That said, I believe there's something about (Narya? Is that the name of his ring?) having the power to rekindle the fire in Men's souls...so maybe it helped, albeit subtly?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: Marshall Burns<br/>\nIt's worth noting that the things that corrupt the Istari aren't necessarily bad or evil. The important thing is that they'renot the flippin' mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might analyze this as saying that they are all corrupted/nearly corrupted by Middle-Earth itself.  Saruman loves power and the enemy, but one might argue that that is a facet of Middle-Earth, as much as comfort or nature.  The Istari are not the Valar, but they did help make the world, and lived in the west.  When they are confronted by the mortal-ish facets of the world, it only makes sense that they might be tempted.  I think you rightfully identify a powerful theme, in that the Istari need to struggle against being waylaid by what they were sent to save.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: Dan MaruschakOut of curiosity, if your primary interest is the themes why are you using the setting as a starting point? In my ownEpic Fantasy gameI decided to make the setting a player-generated run-time thing with the themes and plot structure built into the game since I'm of the opinion that it's hard to tell more than one Epic Fantasy story in the same setting since it's so easy to get fixated on the already established story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that getting fixated on setting is a danger, especially when the setting is as detailed as Tolkein.  Furthermore, the setting and the plot of Tolkein mesh so well that there is a danger of, in embracing the setting, failing to not embrace the plot you know.  I certainly think that Zac could extract the themes he has identified and talked about, and use them to make a Tolkeinesque game without a prescribed setting.  However the difficulty of playing around Tolkein, or someone like him, is fascinating; I think efforts in system to promote an established, but unconstrained, setting are worthwhile and interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDan, do you have any examples of how telling more than one story in a setting went south?
