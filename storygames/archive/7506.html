Sadly, I didn\u2019t take really good notes, and I threw away the character sheets afterwards. So, I\u2019ll do my best to point out some things that I noticed about the game and what made it work for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Game Prep</i><br/>\n<br/>\nA while ago, my in-laws bought me a little dagger. It was one of those knives that you buy in \u201cOriental\u201d stores. Really overwrought, covered in twining dragons, complete with fake gems. Indeed, verging on gaudy. It\u2019s been traveling around in my top dresser drawer for a while, not really doing anything. But, as I was contemplating <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, it sprang to mind, and I knew that it was the perfect knife for our game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I came to the con, prepared with this knife, a nifty cloth to cover it, and a velvet bag from another game. Sadly, I hadn\u2019t prepared for a quality table surface. In the end, we took some cardboard boxes and laid them over the table. Theresa commented that it ruined the ambience, and she was right. Next time, I\u2019ll also have a tablecloth to cover the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for those of you who don\u2019t know, the primary mechanic of the game is the gradual unsheathing of a knife. To try to kill another character, you actually stab his character sheet. It\u2019s very cool. And, a couple layers of cardboard easily protected the table surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we sat down to play. There were five players, plus a few audience members who were allowed to vote for the Wirework sequences. We quickly arrived at our setting, which was the stereotypical Chinese wuxia setting, although we agreed that we would make up English names that sounded like they were translated (e.g. \u201cIron Fist\u201d or \u201cFloating Lotus\u201d) instead of Chinese-sounding gibberish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we got to work creating a blood opera.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is at this point that I must confess something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought this game because it sounded really rather cool. Though, as I read it over, I became concerned. Was there actually enough in this book to enable us to play the game? Did the text actually provide sufficient guidance for a group to learn simply from reading the book?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pleased to report that my fears were essentially unfounded. Certainly, I am familiar with most of the techniques that the game uses, so I might not be the best judge of this. However, I simply worked my way through the game instructions, doing what they say, and we had a satisfying game as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, per the game\u2019s instructions, we threw together a few factions locked in conflict with each other. We ended up with two renegade martial arts schools (the \u201cFloating Lotus School\u201d and the \u201cFlying Crane School\u201d), a dead swordsmith\u2019s son, the Imperial Police, and the Emperor himself. Of course, there was a powerful sword called Night\u2019s Vengeance that functioned as our MacGuffin, which played out quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation is a joy, if you are at all familiar with the genre. Essentially, you choose your character\u2019s signature Color, Weather, and Quirk. Then, during a Wirework sequence, you get bonuses for bringing them into play. In other words, the game actively encourages the sort of cinematic style that is found in these movies. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd a couple of Loyalties, which the book says should conflict with each other, and you\u2019re ready to go.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166633/#Comment_166633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:47:40+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Gameplay</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll put this at the front. <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i> actually tells you how to construct scenes. It tells you how to frame a scene, and, more importantly, it tells you how to figure out when a scene is done. That\u2019s a really nice touch, which I appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I say, I can\u2019t remember all the details of the story. Suffice it to say that the Emperor was behind the theft of the sword and the murder of the swordsmith. It did not help that the swordsmith\u2019s son was in love with Lotus, daughter of the master of the Floating Lotus School. It was even more complicated, because, as was revealed in play, Lotus was also having an affair with the Emperor. All of this was going on behind the back of Iron Fist, the head of the Imperial Police. And then there was White Brows, the insulting master of the Diving Crane School. And yes, they all wanted the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, everyone focuses on the Knife Ritual during discussions of play. I\u2019ll get there in a moment, but first I want to discuss the set budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the game, each player gets a blank set card. This is a location where action in our story takes place. What this also means is that action won\u2019t happen elsewhere. So, by definition, the action of the story is constrained by location. Early in the game, as you\u2019re setting scenes, you\u2019re also defining the available setting. Frame a scene at the rundown tavern, and you\u2019re asserting that the tavern is an important location in the story where a chunk of the action will take place. Additionally, you get a little bonus in Wirework when fighting at a set that you defined. So, it\u2019s to your advantage to frame your character into your set a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our game, we ended up with one unused set card, although this is partly due to the fact that we rushed the game towards the end, due to time constraints. However, I didn\u2019t feel constricted by this mechanic. Instead, it forced us to flesh out details of the various sets, improving and elaborating on them in new ways whenever we returned to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in our game, Iron Fist (the head of the Imperial Police) had the Palace as his home set. That meant that the climactic confrontation between the Emperor and Iron Fist was actually on Iron Fist\u2019s home turf. It worked thematically, too, given that Iron Fist had a Loyalty to Justice\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I want to talk about is the Knife Ritual. Essentially, this is how it works. There\u2019s a knife on the table that is used to track the level of escalation in a conflict. When one character makes a demand of another character, the one player picks up the knife and hands it to the other person. That person has a couple of choices, including escalating to the next level. Eventually, if you don\u2019t duck out, someone\u2019s character sheet is getting stabbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s a bit like a running \u201cBut Only If\u2026\u201d thread from <i>Polaris</i>,c rossed with the escalation from <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. Very cool. But I want to focus on a couple of points that might be overlooked in all the character sheet stabbing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the escalation level of the knife remains after each conflict. In other words, the current state of the knife actually represents the escalation level of the fiction as a whole. This is important, because the escalation level is directly linked to the way that your character can make a demand of another character:<br/>\n<br/>\nSheathed\u2014by implication<br/>\nUnsheathed\u2014directly<br/>\nStabbing\u2014with physical violence<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as we head into a scene, we can look at the state of the knife and get a sense of how directly confrontational this scene can be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166634/#Comment_166634" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:47:51+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of this leads to my second point, which is about the sheathed knife. When you pass someone the knife when it is sheathed, you can only make demands by implication. I think that this will be the part of the game that will simultaneously require the most practice and also yield the most benefit. Let me illustrate with an example from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m playing the Emperor, and Raquel is playing Lotus, the daughter of the master of the Floating Lotus School. I\u2019m being my normal gaming self; in other words, I\u2019m looking for a way to cause lots of trouble. So I frame a scene. Lotus is in the Palace garden, waiting for the Emperor. Eventually, he finds her beneath a tree. They kiss.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, at this point, there hadn\u2019t been a hint of any sort of relationship between the two of them. But Raquel didn\u2019t object and gamely proceeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I pick up the sheathed knife and hand it to Raquel. The Emperor says to Lotus, \u201cYou know what needs to be done.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I can\u2019t actually say what I\u2019m thinking. I can only imply as I hand over the knife to Raquel. Now, she\u2019s trying to figure out what I mean. Then Brett starts laughing. He\u2019s figured it out. Or has he? Again, we can only imply to each other what we\u2019re wanting to have happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Lotus heads off to kill her love, the swordsmith\u2019s son.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that\u2019s what I wanted. <i>But what if it weren\u2019t?</i> What if Lotus had gone off to kill the swordsmith\u2019s son, and that wasn\u2019t what the Emperor had been implying at all? Wouldn\u2019t that have been great?<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I think that there\u2019s a lot of room to play in this area of the game. Again, I had been concerned that this rules section might be problematic in play. Instead, it worked out to be one of the really fun bits in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, as I mentioned earlier, we had to rush the end of the game. This wasn\u2019t altogether bad. After Three Hammers (the swordsmith\u2019s son) had killed Lotus at her request, he came to the Emperor to regain Night\u2019s Vengeance. We ended up with a massive conflict in the throne room of the Palace. First, the Emperor killed Three Hammers, but not before Three Hammers placed his curse upon the sword. Then, the Emperor and White Brows fought, ultimately resulting in White Brows being banished from the empire. And then Iron Fist intervened, ultimately killing the Emperor and destroying Night\u2019s Vengeance before leaving the Palace, a regicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, that\u2019s a cool ending. But I can\u2019t help but think that we could have done even better, having more practice with the tools at our disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, everyone was buzzing about how much fun the game was. Yeah, I think that I\u2019ll be playing this one again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166641/#Comment_166641" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T12:07:35+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 12:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it was pretty nifty.  i'd like to play a game sometime with less of a time constraint so that there is time for more of a slow build.  i did really like the way it ended, but i thought it escalated really really fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166647/#Comment_166647" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T12:43:43+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 12:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Yes, that\u2019s what I wanted.  <em>But what if it weren\u2019t?</em></blockquote>You have just pegged the thing that has been drawing me out, away from the clear and simple fields of explicit conflict resolution, where everything is stated and understood.

As far as I can tell, the game doesn't give authority to anyone to tell them to shut up and let the other person take his turn. Now, this didn't end up being a problem for us, because I put on my "GM/Facilitator/I'm holding the rulebook so I'm in charge here" hat to manage the action. But that was just the structure that I imposed at the table; it's not actually written into the game.

I can generally accept that, especially if it's in conjunction with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>If you've got the card, or it's a thing of no consequence, you can say whatever you want about it.</blockquote>\nI like this rule, especially in conjunction with the Wirework reward that lets you steal cards for other players. Fun!<br><br>That being said, I like to have some rule to appeal to if there's an aesthetic disagreement at the table. This is different than dealing with a bad player and is more of a method to synchronize the table's aesthetic sense. Even something as simple as the rule from <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> that states that you use the aesthetic sense of the most critical person at the table. That way, the table knows how much consensus is needed to go forward. Because rules aren't just about structuring the fiction; they are also about structuring the interactions of the players (he said pedantically).<br><br>So, when you play, how do you end up deciding between two varying ideas? Assume that they aren't about a character's actions or about something that's on a card.

Actually, I saw this displayed in the game of <i>Zombie Cinema</i> that we played earlier that day, where a particular player was worked over by players using the system as a protest against the way that he was playing the game.

(see Play) Your only opportunity to say things about a set is when you're filling out the card in the first place, or setting a scene there. So, if you're <em>defining thet set</em> or <em>setting a scene in the smithy,</em> then you may say, "The forge is heated by the breath of immense fire-breathing dragons."</p>\n<p>When someone else sets a scene in the same set, they have the privilege and responsibility of describing it differently.</p>\n<p>Those are the rules. The logic here is, the rules are not about <em>facts</em> but actually about <em>representation.</em> They are telling you who may say about what, not telling you what is and isn't true.</p>\n<p>Here are the consequences of the rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should be very careful, when you're defining a set, to say exactly what it encompasses.</li>\n<li>You can say more or less whatever you want when you have the talking stick.</li>\n<li>Since other players can describe sets differently, it's within their power, when they set scenes in the smithy, to say things like, "The only light in the room comes from the forge, intermittently interrupted by Number Ten Ox's broad shoulders as he shovels coal into it." They are bound by the set's size and identity, but they're not constrained to your representation, and I think it's entirely reasonable to play a game with unreliable representation like that, where "immense dragons" turn out to be a metaphor for Number Ten Ox's youthful vigor.</li>\n<li>You need to use your own social perceptions and maybe even talk to the other players about your set ideas to ensure that everyone's cool with them. Apply the thinking in Audience all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If that doesn't work for you, try this house rule:</p>\n<p><strong>A House Divided</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sets, like props, are owned by players once they are created. Like props, they may be stolen via wirework.</li>\n<li>You may set a scene in any defined set. You specify all details of the scene <em>except</em> facts about the set; the person who owns the set card does this.</li>\n<li>When someone says something about a set, and you don't think it's cool, you may make an out-of-character knife demand about it. This demand <em>may</em> include, "Give me the set card,* but it does not <em>require</em> it. You may simply ask them to change some detail of their description. Character lives remain at stake, but in this case the knife ritual does not have to be associated with any fictional action. Should you go to wirework, do not claim any coins for displays, props, sets, etc. The decision rides entirely on the audience's voting. The 'description' in your wirework sequence should be an appeal for why your portrayal is good - don't say why the other's is bad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I suspect that this house rule might be more trouble than it's worth, but who knows?
