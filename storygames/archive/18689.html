Character creation in particular does a lovely job of tying characters into each other and their world around them. And the GameMaster Intrusion mechanic (<a href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2013/08/03/gm-intrustion-compels-and-aspects/" rel="nofollow">Rob Donoghue</a> is correct here, it's a terrible, terrible name for what it does) makes it clear that if you're going to accept some GM fuckery, you're tying another character into it at least a little bit (and rewarding them, too). The vast majority of the game mechanics still mostly focus on physical combat -- odd, given that Monte Cook says that Exploration is the primary mode with which the game wants you to engage -- but still, I had low expectations for the system and they were exceeded.<br/><br/>The setting, on the other hand, leaves me very disappointed.<br/><br/>World-building crafted as an exceptional tool, at least in my opinion, is exemplified by games such as Exalted 1st, Tenra Bansho Zero, Iron Kingdoms and even Planescape. Those settings do a great job of establishing thesis statements about their world and point of view and then demanding in a most wonderful way that players create characters that are corollaries to the core ideas of the setting.<br/><br/>I didn't find any such core theme in Numenera and, for me, it doesn't grab my attention. The central idea for Numenera seems to be..um, anything goes - the future is weird!  Monte suggests that the setting is inspired by Gene Wolf's Book of the New Sun fiction but doesn't do much with that inspiration other than pay it lip-service.  There are lots and lots of (and lots) of weird places and towns and cities that offer opportunity for 'dungeon delving' (of a sort) but I didn't get themes that tie this together for me. It's like someone laid out a wreath and Santa dolls and pine trees and wrapping paper but doesn't give you any idea of what Christmas is.  I've got the style of what all this is, but to me it forgets the substance.<br/><br/>It's not so much that I was expecting a literary sci-fi fantasy setting version on a par with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz" rel="nofollow">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a> or something but I was expecting a setting a bit more than Gamma World with nanotech magic.<br/><br/>It sounds like I'm bashing this game but I'm trying not to. It's gorgeous, it has interesting ways that characters are tied together during creation, and there are literally a thousand and one ideas in here to play with. You should spend your money on it. I guess I just wanted to put out here why Numenera's setting is failing me because it's illuminating for me to distinguish why.  I'm going to tinker with the setting here big-time and try to invent the thesis statements of my own if only because there are so many pretty toys to play with. There's at least one Big Idea here that I can glom onto (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem" rel="nofollow">Anathem</a>, I'm looking at you)<br/><br/>And maybe that's Monte's point but I have to say, I'm kind tired of this approach. I want the tools to create something literary, inspirations that Monte specifically cites, not simply a sandbox filled with shiny, disconnected toys.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419654/#Comment_419654" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T15:23:30+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  3:23PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a shame, I was hoping for something a bit more based on all the hype I've been hearing about Numanera.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419662/#Comment_419662" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T16:26:49+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  4:26PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And maybe that's Monte's point but I have to say, I'm kind tired of this approach.

Something about systems or themes as the spine of an experience. It was part of my reaction to<i> Seclusium</i> too; a big sandbox of things that doesn't quite speak to me, even though all the parts say that it should. Which sounds odd, because Seclusium itself has a definite theme, but for me it doesn't quite get me across the gap from the idea of the Seclusium to what the idea of this particular Seclusium should be. I should probably post more about that in the other thread.<br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to read more than a few pages of Numeneria yet, so I can't say if my reaction will parallel yours. But it does strike me that the Big Ideas for Planescape can be summed up pretty succinctly. Moreover, the elements of the setting are unifying in the sense that adding them together reveals the common theme behind them, and the systems additions reinforce this, with belief points and so on. The Great Wheel ties into Sigil being at the center and not at the center, which ties into the competing factions who are all simultaneously right and wrong. Factions tie into beliefs, beliefs tie into everything.  (I want to run a Burning Wheel Planescape campaign.)<br/><br/>Again, I haven't read Numeneria yet, so I'm curious what the ideas are that tie the setting together, if there are any. From what you've said, it doesn't sound like you've found any, which is a bit disappointing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
