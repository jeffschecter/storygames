                    I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-111/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 111, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/23 and 07/07.</b></a><br/><br/>My attendance to CCXP Cologne 2019 delayed the collection a week, thus you’ll find a total of 11 new role-playing games among other games.<br/><br/>There are story games like the gm-less <b>moonflower</b>, which utilizes tarot cards. The game is about a travel to the moon to plant and care about the flower. I got a somewhat melancholic feel from it and feel remembered of the anime Night on the Galactic Railroad. The second story game is <b>HORROR STORIES</b>, it’s card based and maybe rather on the fringe what can be counted as a rpg. I think it’s close enough to be included even if the cards are just used as story inspiration cards. If you are more into a good post apocalyptic setting you should check out <b>Pirates of a Shattered World</b>, that’s if you like to spice up swashbuckling with quite some strange stuff. If you are more down for a traditional post-apo experience you might be more interested in <b>Scorched Earth</b>, which allows you to build the post apocalyptic world of your wishes. Now, if you are more interested into modern games and spies you should check out <b>The Spy Game</b> and <b>Super Secret Spy Agency</b> both are inspired by D&amp;D 5E. While Spy Games puts it into its name, the Spy Agency appears to highlight that it’s suitable for two player (GM + player) games. Now you might be into some medieval low fantasy setting, where you’ll find <b>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery</b> for the European spice and <b>Jordenheim</b> to have some viking flavor. I personally do like and backed the <b>Asphodel Complex</b>. Which is a modern day horror game, with really cool maps and apparently an easy system. For your dose of superheroes you might like to check <b>Hit the Streets</b>, which explore street level heroes like Jessica Jones and the other Defenders. Last but not least <b>L.O.R.E.</b> is a game that tries a more universal to generic approach, offering a tool box for various settings.<br/>There are as well many cool settings. Like <b>Trinity Continuum: Aberrant</b> by Onyx Path, which offers a fresh edition of the Aberrant of elderdays. My interest in <b>Pulp Fantastic</b> for Savage Worlds got spiked by the setting and <b>Fateforge</b> as well as <b>Fight or Flight</b> for D&amp;D 5E are just beautiful to look at.<br/>Of course there are many more interesting projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Low Fantasy Role-Playing Gams<br/>2 Post-Apocalyptic Role-Playing Gamea<br/>2 Spy Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Story Games Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>3 Settings<br/>4 D&amp;D 5E Settings<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Sourcebooks<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>6 Dice Projects<br/>1 Coin Projects<br/>4 Accessoires<br/>5 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Notebook<br/>1 Podcast<br/>1 Deck of Cards<br/>1 RPG Comic<br/>3 Maps Projects<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Skirmish Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-111/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-111/</a></b> </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/14/crowdfunding-collection-112/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23112&amp;Mode=like">#112</a>, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/07 and 07/14</a></b>.<br/><br/>This time around on regular schedule, yet as I’ll be attending a Convention next weekend, the next collection will likely be published in two weeks. Though, onto the projects on hand.<br/><br/>The <b>Flashback RPG</b> offers a Fantasy and Steampunk setting, along with a system that aims to provide a notable flashback mechanic for cinematic flair. I personally am most impressed by the idea that characters can climb a titan like foe and inflict damage to its various limbs. Then there’s <b>Demigods</b> which offers a modern day setting, in which your characters are the titular demi-gods. It’s a Powered by the Apocalypse game, and I am fascinated by the idea that you can choose the Pantheons you’ll want to have involved rather freely. If you enjoy Anime and Manga you might like to take a look at <b>BESM Fourth Edition</b>. The American game „Big Eyes, Small Mouths“ aims to emulate all kinds of genre with fast and cinematic rules. In addition you’ll find that next to the „normal“ edition, they do offer a „light“ edition, with only like 1/3 of the pages. Last but not least <b>Ekphrasis</b> is a narrative story game for two players. In which you’ll create surreal stories based on prose. I think it’s an interesting concept, the zine format is quite nice and you can get the PDF for a buck. Thus, take a look.<br/>Then there is the D&amp;D setting <b>Kaldori Project</b>, which I finde interesting, and the very fascinating looking <b>Magumundi Bestiary</b>. In regards of dice I think the <b>Vulcan Forged Carbon</b> ones do look cool, and am intruiged by the <b>Random Character Generator Dice</b>. Of course there are many more interesting projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Setting<br/>4 Sourcebooks<br/>4 Adventures<br/>3 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessoire<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/14/crowdfunding-collection-112/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/07/14/crowdfunding-collection-112/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/28/crowdfunding-collection-113/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 113, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/14 and 07/28.</b></a><br/><br/>After a fabulous convention weekend the collection is back, covering two weeks and presenting you with no fewer than 59 projects. I’d like to briefly highlight the German translation of Alas for the sea <b>So tief die schwere See</b> which is currently being financed by System Matters Verlag. On that note, you migth as well like to check out the translation of <b>Mythic Constantinopel</b>.<br/><br/>Onto the English projects, I really like <b>Magical Kitties Save the Day</b>. Cats and kittens are a weakness of mine, the box looks fabulous and if it weren’t for the shipping I’d back it. Next to this I like <b>Paper Arcade</b>, which offers 4 small games, and equity-based pay for the creators. If you are more into gm-less games you should check out <b>Inspire</b>, where you will play spirits trying to achieve godhood. Then there’s <b>Barbarians of the Ruined Earth</b>, which utilizes the Black Hack, to offer an over-the-top post-apocalyptic setting. If you are more into Fate, take a look at <b>Magonomia</b>, which is set in the renaissance and includes authentic european lore. Well, and if you are into D&amp;D 5E check out <b>Forts &amp; Frontiers</b>, which takes a look at North America during the 17. and 18. century.<br/><b>S.N.A.P.S. Heroes Boot Camp</b> is a quite unusual game, in that it aims to provide help in improving the players social skills with theurapeutic means an an actual therapist participating in the game.<br/>Then there is the „Break Kickstarter“ campaign, leading to quite some unusual games. There is <b>Twelve Hundred Words</b>, which offers 5 little games, about 200 words, which are focused on mental health. Next to a play-by-post campaign. I like the idea and did actually back it. With <b>Brain Trust</b> you’ll have a chance to see the development of a game up close and influence it as the campaign progresses. <b>| BLACK | RED | WHITE |</b> does promise three new games, based on the dreames of the author, whom you got to trust.  <b>Chain Mail</b> on the other hand is almost traditional, offering essentially a play-by-mail roleplaying campaign. Where one continues the story of another. The last entry is a bit morbid, if you don’t wanna read it, just jump to the next paragraph. The game <b>The Tower</b> is written and done, by the author of Killshot and High Plains Samurai, yet it will only be published once the author has literally died.<br/>There are many more cool projects, like the audio gamebook <b>The Vampire of Havena</b> by Ulisses North America. The very stylish <b>Kisarta</b> setting and rulesbook für D&amp;D 5E. A documentary movie named <b>Let’s Play: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Behind Bars</b> and a big campaign for several people named <b>Into the Mad Lands</b> run by Mad Jay as GM utilizing Forbbiden Lands and B/X.<br/>There are many more, interesting projects, which you’ll find here:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>6 Role-Playing Games<br/>5 Break Kickstarter Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Therapeutic Role-Playing Game<br/>1 (Audio) Gamebook<br/>2 Settings<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Settings<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Sourcebooks<br/>5 Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>3 Playing Cards<br/>4 Accessoires<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Podcast<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>2 Map-Apps Projects<br/>1 Documentations<br/>3 Break-Kickstarter Projects<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Game with RPG Relevance<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/>Article: <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/28/crowdfunding-collection-113/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/07/28/crowdfunding-collection-113/</a></b> </div>

                            Same for me, of all the projects I cover it's a solid "first".<br/>Told a friend the bigger concept, and he asked me to not elaborate, hence my warning.                        </div>
