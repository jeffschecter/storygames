A light went off, because, due to his friendship with a good friend of mine, I had <i>assumed</i> he had a strong background. My bad, I know, but this is something I need to fix!<br/><br/>I know that some things are game specific and some things are shared amongst games. Here's my query: What questions would you (or do you) ask before the game gets started in a con situation to make sure that the players are all up for their responsibilities during the game?<br/><br/>I can think of some generic ones, please help me think up a good questionnaire for future cons. Also, if your question is specific to a game, preface the question with the title.<br/><br/>1. Do you run games as a DM/GM?<br/>2. PTA: How comfortable are you with scene framing*?<br/><br/>*-Yeah, I know it's the Producer's role to frame scenes. I guess that's a problem for another thread.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80940/#Comment_80940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T13:07:22+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  1:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, at a con just I assume everybody at my table is an indie-newbie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80944/#Comment_80944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T13:09:43+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  1:09PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my biggest criticisms that I've received is that I spend too much time explaining system before starting a game.

But I don't know know if that's possible.<br/><br/>I do know, in line with what Ron Edwards wrote about in a couple of threads at The Forge, that every session of a game is going to have someone who is the the procedural "leader".

So I generally identify one or two 'big ideas' in the specific indie game and really focus on those.  In PTA, it's fan mail.  In FLFS, it's thematic batteries.  In Roach, it's the cards and the reputation chips.  This, and an overview of how one rolls dice, is all I explain before we start playing.  I don't even try to explain the "whole" game.  There is certainly more to explain, and some of it crops up in play, but I don't worry about it until it happens, and I make a few subtle nudges at any game-in-progress to keep it focused on the 'big idea' that I'm stressing.  I find this incredibly liberating when running games, and simplifies a lot.<br/><br/>Disturbingly, I'm realizing that I treat it like a lesson plan with a specific educational standard that I'm hitting.

All I got from the original post was that someone didn't know something about an RPG that was new to him. If I'm not mistaken, that happens all the time. That's what happens when people play new games.  <br/><br/>But for some reason this incident came back "months later," and you called it your "bad."  I was just curious what could have been the ramifications of what had happened, or failed to happen, in the game.  <br/><br/>I know that asking for specifics is now considered some part of an aggressive machismo that needs to be ignored in some circles these days, but really.

It can be brief but I think it is important.<br/><br/>How much do you need to know to have fun in a simple conflict beginning in medias res?  That's all you need to communicate before beginning play.  Some games require more than others (<i>The Roach</i> is actually bad for this, because you can't even start until you've laid out a couple of important concepts.  Die handling is, happily, not among them).  <i>TSOY </i>is wonderfully modular, so you can show how the dice work and then jump right in.  Later, explain Keys and Secrets.  Then BDTP.  You can structure a one-shot to provide stepped learning of the system.  I think it's OK if a player has to make decisions based on what they know right now about the rules, instead of what would be possible if they knew everything.  Nobody has ever said "That sucks!  I totally would have brought down the pain if only I'd known what it was before the first scene!" to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80980/#Comment_80980" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T14:48:33+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  2:48PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone needs to know what their role in the game is about up front.<br/><br/>For D&amp;D, that means you say, "I describe situations, and you describe what your character does and attempts. We roll dice to figure out what happens!" <br/><br/>For PTA that means you say, "When your turn comes around, you tell me a location, whether it's a plot scene or a character scene, and set a broad agenda for the scene. I describe the situation and other people can contribute. Then it goes around the table, and so on until the Budget is out!"<br/><br/>I always do this, especially in con games. Hell, I do it sometimes with my sit-down group when we've played a game before. It gets them focused.<br/><br/>You wouldn't expect someone to know how to throw the ball to first in baseball just by sending them out to shortstop and telling them "Just watch what everyone else does".<br/><br/>Fuck "ambassadorship", who cares about that nonsense unless you're a game designer (and dead.)<br/><br/>It's all about teaching and learning to play.<br/><br/>Even a very experienced athlete still does basic exercises.

At conventions, I simply never assume anyone knows anything and don't really believe anything anyone tells me about themselves.  As far as I know, the players just accidentally wandered in thinking this was going to be a panel on ballpeen hammers in Star Trek or whatever.  So I always describe what everyone's role is, even if I am confident they already know. It always helps the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81063/#Comment_81063" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T07:06:15+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  7:06AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2007 7:07AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mark,<br/><br/>Thanks for the reply.<br/><br/>I had a bunch of follow up questions, but in light of your desire not to go into specifics, I'll pass.<br/><br/>I will say this:<br/><br/>Talking <i>less</i> pre-game seems to be a good idea -- which I've gleaned from my own experience and from every post on the matter I've ever seen on the board.<br/><br/>Yes, certain rules need to be addressed up front (like Joshua explaining Fan Mail before a PtA game), but techniques and such? Let them emerge in the fun of play. <br/><br/>The thing about story games (at least how I envision them) is that they draw on the same fun of story that makes us care about story in other media -- interesting characters, strong situation, twists, turns, imaginative bits of incident. Scene framing and things like that only let those qualities emerge more strongly, and faster.  <br/><br/>So there's no need really to go into all sorts of detail on that front -- nobody has to be clear on all this out of the box -- since they'll grock it pretty fast once things are going. In fact, they might not notice, because they'll probably be having fun. <br/><br/><i>If</i> someone after the game says, "Hey, I noticed we just sort of jumped from one scene to the next," or whatever, or, "This game moved faster than other games," or, "How come we didn't do the traveling through the wilderness from the village to the city to get to the tomb," then you might want to have a further discussion, because the person clearly wants to get under the hood.<br/><br/>As for your last question, "So, aren't there any questions that anyone would think is essential to know who you're playing with?":<br/><br/>In life outside of cons, I'll ask someone who's played before, "So, what are your favorite memories and experiences in games." -- just to see if the kinds of things that interest them interest me. But at a Con?  I just jump in.  There will be little I can do to change what's about to happen or give them a useful info dump.<br/><br/>I do, however, pay attention for clues about comprehension. Simple things: As a new rule gets introduced, are they nodding their heads, looking confused, looking across the room. I don't think this stuff can be front-loaded. But it can be made clear moment by moment in play.<br/><br/>But it's a con game. Four compressed hours that usually strip out a lot of things (no pre-play character creation, more of a rush through the rules, certain rules glossed over for speed, not enough time for the players to actually know each other...) So, by definition it's not a good experience.<br/><br/>To bluntly address your thread title, I think JD has it (though in my view it's less about roles than the rules): You can't gauge familiarity.  You can, however,  teach the rules. Do it clean and lean at first, and then let them learn through experience in play. As you play their confusion or confidence will let you gauge their familiarity <i>right at that moment</i>. I think that's the best we can do, which is fine.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
