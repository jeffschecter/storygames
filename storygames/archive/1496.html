                    Announcing version 0.9* of <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>, a game of knightly quests.<br/>This is medieval fantasy â€“ as the medievals knew it.<br/><i>Play</i>â€¦ a valiant Knight, a resourceful Lady, a talented Troubadour, a puissant Enchanter, a holy Ecclesiastic, or even a Speaking Beast.<br/><i>Quest</i>â€¦ by gaining boons from the colourful characters you encounter.<br/><i>Collaborate</i>â€¦ as you take turns to provide challenges for the group.<br/><i>Drive</i>â€¦ the story by your choices of character motivation.<br/><br/>All the creamy system goodness of Clinton R. Nixon's The Shadow of Yesterday, with extra chocolate sauce and sprinkles â€“ in an authentic setting that Marie de France, Thomas Malory, Edmund Spenser and William Morris would recognise as their own.<br/><br/>With three magic settings (High, Medium or Low) and a cunning playing-card-based system of intelligent-random rapid generation for the encountered characters.<br/><br/>This version 0.9 PDF (113 pages) is issued for critique and playtest. Because it's built on Clinton's game (like a Jeepney is built on a Jeep), it should be very playable already, but I'm keen to get playtest feedback on the tweaks and additions I've made and on the usability of the text â€“ taking to heart the recent thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1455&amp;page=1#Item_64" rel="nofollow">What's the Damn Rush?</a>.<br/><br/>EDIT: So what I'm looking for is concrete advice on what I need to fix before formal publication.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance.<br/><br/>* I'm calling it 0.9 because that reflects its state of readiness better than 0.1, which I originally used. It hasn't been through 9 iterations.                </div>

                            Anyone got specific font advice? I'm thinking Bookman Old Style at the moment (clear to read on screen, looks like it would be clear on paper but I can't print from here). Designer-y dudes, are you shrieking "No! No!" at me yet?                        </div>

                            Well, since nobody has asked the questions I hoped they would ask, I'm going to do my own TUQ*.<br/><br/>Q: Is this just a TSoY kitbash?<br/>A: I'm glad you asked that. No, it's not. <br/><br/>About a quarter of the total text is Clinton's Solar System (as per TSOY), but substantially rewritten to fit the style of the rest of the writing. It also contains clarifications taken from <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TSOY" rel="nofollow">RandomWiki</a> and from the answers to a couple of questions that I asked Clinton directly, and a handy summary chart for the processes of ability checks and Bringing Down the Pain.<br/><br/>Q: What makes up the other three-quarters? Is it mostly setting?<br/>A: Actually a large part of it is concerned with the character creation system. <br/><br/>A draw of three cards at the start of each "encounter" determines a full-blown character, with abilities, secrets, a Key, and points in his or her pools. In order to make that as straightforward as possible, there's a great deal of guidance given on how to create the encounter characters quickly and easily, including some comprehensive character sheets which basically just require checking a few boxes â€“ once you've drawn the cards, it's pretty obvious on the sheet which boxes you should check. This means you don't need a lot of prep - it should work as almost a pickup game - and you can have a rotating GM position which changes over for each encounter. <br/><br/>And then there's a truckload of Abilities, Secrets and Keys, nearly 20 pages. Most of Clinton's original ones are there, apart from a few that didn't fit the setting, but there are a lot of new ones as well. And that's just the open ones; there are several closed Abilities and a bunch of closed Secrets for the Enchanter and Ecclesiastic character types.<br/><br/>Q: What's a character type?<br/>A: It's what I've done instead of the race/culture thing from TSoY. It determines, to a degree, what Abilities and Secrets your character gets, and contributes colour. <br/><br/>It turned out rather like "character classes" in AD&amp;D, although that wasn't what it was based on â€“ it's more like Gary Gygax and I were both working from the same set of archetypes. So the Knight is like a Paladin, the Troubadour is a bit Bardish, the Enchanter is obviously a Magic-User and the Ecclesiastic a Cleric (though not just the hit-point-restore-o-mat type of cleric, cooler than that). There isn't really a Thief equivalent, though. The closest thing is, oddly, the Lady, more because she's clever and resourceful and tends to use non-combat means to attain her goals than for any other reason.<br/><br/>You can have "crosstypes", as well, kind of a dual-class thing where you're basically your primary type but you have a secondary type as well and this gives you access to more Secrets. A Church Knight, for example, is a Knight who's also an Ecclesiastic and can do things like break enchantments and bless the group with bonus dice.<br/><br/>Q: So the game is pretty firmly medieval in its setting?<br/>A: Oh, yes, it's a highly authentic medieval-romance setting (note, not "romance" in the Breaking the Ice sense, but in the "like a tale, but about nobles instead of peasants" sense). Since I greatly enjoyed my Middle English classes at university and have continued to love medieval stuff more and more ever since, this is the big selling point for me, though others' mileage may vary. I think I've captured the genre quite effectively, and it's a genre which has recurred in popularity fairly regularly for the past 600 years. You could totally play Tamora Pierce's Tortall with this, almost out of the box, as well as any of the Arthurian stories which follow Malory rather than attempting to be "authentic" about the sixth century. This is 14th-century Western Europe's fantasy of its recent past, like Westerns are 20th century America's fantasy of its recent past (and plenty more parallels could be drawn between the two). But it's also got Keys, so that your characters can be more three-dimensional than the ones in the source material.<br/><br/>*Totally Unasked Questions.                        </div>
