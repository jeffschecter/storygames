The playbooks involve moves that really help to tie them into the fiction, whether through contacts, contracts, employment, businesses, etc., but without being as involved as, say, gangs or followers in ApocWorld.<br/>I think the main differences come in how they slightly tweak the Hard Moves, giving descriptions that better fit a Lovecraftian setting. They also have a quick and easy method for making horrors on the fly.<br/><br/>AND their Ebon Eaves setting is amazing for one-shots. I playtested it last Thursday, with two players relatively new to RPGs, and we had characters made in five minutes, they took another five minutes to make their choices on the Ebon Eaves checklist, and five more minutes for me to read over what they had selected so I could get it ready to play.<br/><br/>...in retrospect, I should've had the players fill out the checklist BEFORE making characters, but hey, live and learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389172/#Comment_389172" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T10:12:15+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 10:12AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 10:12AM by Johnstone.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a <a href="http://realityblurs.com/wordpress/?p=4298" rel="nofollow">podcast on the Reality Blurs site</a> in which the author goes into some details (click the image).

I realize that they may not be super familiar with the indie games community, but paying attention to how other AW hacks have done things doesn't seem like too much to ask.  I think they would be getting much more support if people had read and enjoyed playing their game before being asked to fork over cash.

Everything about this screams "opportunistic cash grab". I agree that any sort of NDA on an AW hack is absurd to every possible degree, especially when compared to the process of other published hacks (Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, Monster of the Week). It's equally absurd that we have yet to see even one single mechanic, and therefore haven't even the slightest clue whether these people can even write a move.<br/><br/>The pitch on the Kickstarter page seems to be almost nothing beyond "You like Cthulhu, don't you? And you like AW, don't you? Yay!" This perception is vastly enhanced by the seemingly arbitrary name-dropping of Fiasco and FATE, two games that have nothing to do with AW, and whose presence is left completely unexplained.  It seems pitched at a non-SG audience (and must be succeeding at that, given how they've somehow made a lot of money already), which would be fine, except that it would be nice to drop a bone for fans of the designer you're ripping off.<br/><br/>Now, we don't actually know anything about the content of the game. Perhaps they do understand AW at a deep level, and have done a good job making changes and innovations to adapt it to a Cthulhu setting. But I'm skeptical. The small glimpses of actual game we've gotten point in the opposite direction. Stupidgremlin's description of it as a "reskin" is not at all encouraging, but perhaps the most disheartening thing are the stretch goals:<br/><br/>Sean, how can it be the case that your game was complete with eleven playbooks, but that you are capable of writing a total of 35 (so far!) that are all interesting, high quality, and add to the game? Can you give us some insight into that design decision?<br/><br/>*(I'm trying to decide if I care enough to overcome the hurdle of downloading it and setting aside time to listen, especially since I feel I can guarantee a large percentage of it will be the same annoying marketing-speak that's in the Kickstarter and razorwise's post.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389185/#Comment_389185" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T11:35:27+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 11:35AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sean,<br/><br/>stupidgremlin summed it up best, this is what feels weird:\n<blockquote>I agree that they really are treating it like some super-secret project, when they really don't need to.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I don't care how embedded within the current AW-hacking culture you are, I mostly just don't want to put down thirty bucks for another copy of the Apocalypse World rulebook with a few of the names changed around, y'know? The examples of play podcast didn't do much for me, but I'm a Cthulhu fan and I definitely like what you've said about the GM prep so far. So I'm at least interested. The lack of a sample playbook or two is a definite minus, so I'll be looking forward to seeing that. Also, an example of the insanity rules, perhaps an AP example, would be even more crucial to my decision-making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389192/#Comment_389192" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T12:13:14+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 12:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 6:07PM by mease19.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really surprised that the game seemed to come out of the blue.

I'm going to be as general as I can with the details, and if there's some questions about them, I'll try to be a little more specific without revealing any critical info.<br/><br/>-You know how normally you can take debilities in ApocWorld to avoid killing blows? It's not always a given in <b>tremulus</b>. Depending on how the Keeper sets it, you <i>might</i> have that option, or you might have to deal with death as a constant threat. Also, if the Keeper allows it, you can do the same thing when your Sanity is at the breaking point, with mental disorders. Unlike debilities, which are permanent penalties, these either permanently affect your moves, or give you new moves, that involve the disorder itself and how it affects your character.<br/><br/>-Rituals are BAD for you. Even if you have everything you need prepared, crossed the "t"s and dotted the "i"s, be expected to suffer. A lot. From my Call of Cthulhu experience, this is the way it should be, but in far too many other Lovecraftian games, it tends to be glossed over, ignored, or made too easy to overcome.<br/><br/>-If your friends die or go insane, your Sanity will suffer. The closer a friend they are, the worse off you will be. This is something I <i>haven't</i> seen in other Lovecraftian games, at least not as specific as this is.<br/><br/>-A simple framework is provided that helps people who may have trouble putting together a horror game. You pick a couple of options, a couple of threats, and put them into this framework, and you're ready to go. Nothing really pre-planned, but with helpful cues for turning it into a good, sanity-sapping story.<br/><br/>-Horrors are easy to put together, based on the number of players. While they have plenty of stock Lovecraftian examples, they also encourage you to come up with your own terrible creatures, to keep everyone on their toes.<br/><br/>-And again, the Ebon Eaves playset is amazing. Even if you don't use it as it is presented, it gives LOTS of great ideas for threats and twists that you can use in any game.<br/><br/><i>TERMINOLOGY EDITED FOR ACCURACY</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389224/#Comment_389224" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T16:42:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  4:42PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 4:56PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Redacted]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389226/#Comment_389226" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T16:53:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  4:53PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 5:14PM by Mcdaldno.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDITED TO REFLECT SOME UP-THREAD REDACTION:</b>\n<blockquote>[comments that read like ad hominen attacks on Sean, mixed with apprehensions and judgments about his publishing strategy]</blockquote>\nMaybe he's just from a design culture that's more covetous and secretive about design implementation.

It's not Monsterhearts-style reinvention. It's using Apocalypse World to do Lovecraft. So fair enough. <br/><br/>Or perhaps more accurately: it reads as Apocalypse World drifted in a trad direction. For example, there are no sex moves (or equivalent) and the stats are Reason, Passion, Might, Luck, Affinity. One of the basic moves is Puzzle Things Out, for which you roll +reason.

I really like some of your decisions, like removing XP (I think?) and I really like the concept behind Poke Around (though I have some thoughts on refining it, maybe).  My impulse would actually be to preserve less of Apocalypse World than you do here, but I'll send you more comments on that privately.<br/><br/>All in all, though, thanks for responding postively to some criticism and being a good sport about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/razorwise" title="razorwise"><img alt="razorwise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/razorwise">razorwise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389241/#Comment_389241" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T17:59:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  5:59PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 6:01PM by razorwise.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>I think that's accurate.

I Like it a lot! Very atmospheric <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>The summary of the basic moves however, shrieks of cut and paste with AW. This is fine, but I think there is an untapped opportunity of 're-imagined' basic moves that could embrace the Cthulhu investigator experience rather than a simple reskinning of apocalyptic moves. I also think the lessons learned and elucidated by John Harper on the nature of <b>seize by force</b> [take control] as a peripheral move are well worth heeding here.<br/><br/>Also, I assume there is a variant on the <b>open your mind to the Cthulhu Mythos</b> sort of [basic] move? Why isn't that on the playbook? I'd be at the heart of my game for sure.<br/><br/>Im also curious to the Trust / Bond mechanic and or XP reward cycle and how it feeds back into both the emergent story and character development.<br/><br/>Is there going to be chapter on adapting pre-published Cthulhu adventures? I found that chapter of DW to be one of the most practicable pieces of GM advice in a book (other than the chapter on MCing in AW) for a long time. <br/><br/>Keep feeding us more mechanics and systems so we can give feedback!

They are tweaked, refined, and altered a tad for <b><i>tremulus</i></b>. A couple were added to take the system into a more investigatory direction. The special moves (and Lore move) each playbook offers is what puts them firmly into new territory.<br/><br/>I had read Harper's article some time back, and I see the merit contained within the article, but I counter that gamers need an option like that even if they use it rarely, because anyone "in the real world" can try Take Control from time to time. It has been clearly refined and defined within the text, and multiple examples of all the moves are contained within <b><i>tremulus</i></b>.<br/><br/>There is no general open your mind to the Mythos. It kinda comes when it comes. Whenever any character rolls a natural 12, they get a bit of Dark Insight where they earn a point of Lore and the Keeper may, at his whim, provide them with some insight or information (presented via revelation, vision, or what-have-you, as best suits the story). One of the playbooks, the Psychic, can try to tap into the weirdness, but that's a bit iffy (as you'd expect, right?).<br/><br/>Trust determines your relationship with other characters, and the Help move has been bumped slightly to encourage cooperation (7-9 = +1 and expose yourself to danger, 10+ = +2 to help) but has a built in consequence to mitigate abuse (a miss can result in a loss of Trust or the Keeper holds one). The benefits of the Help move also serve to make a character feel very alone when they invariably go off to do something by themselves (as they miss the possibility of aid). People have found establishing the web of relationships forged by Trust to be simple and enjoyable and goes a long way in determining the group's dynamic. Trust can be lost relatively easily and is hard to gain (much as in real life). There are some options to establishing Trust. Each character has a number of Trust points equal to the number of characters at the beginning of a story. Four players, four points of Trust. Trust is then privately assigned to each character from 0 = Casual acquaintance, 1 = Friend, 2= Close Friend (trust with secrets), 3 = Closest friend (Trust with Life). Trust doesn't have to go both ways. No negative Trust by default (though some folks have tried it in playtest and it doesn't break things). When Trust is going to go beyond -3 or +3, the Trust resets, the character gains a point of Lore, and gains a secret from the trusted character.<br/><br/>Weird fiction is not about a lot of character progression. It's more about solving mysteries and dealing with emergent threats. As such, XP has been discarded as a driver. The Keeper may opt to allow characters to advance at a story's end or whenever he feels the characters have made sufficient progress in a plot line (as in a particularly long story). Ultimately, finding information, discovering clues, and earning Lore are the big drivers of <b><i>tremulus</i></b>. <br/><br/>There is not a chapter on converting adventures over, because the Framework system in place allows you to create an adventure outline in about 15-20 minutes which generates around 6-8 hours of play or you can use town generation system and start playing immediately. With the Framework system, you can easily port over traditional scenarios with little issue, but we are more interested in the stories you can create.<br/><br/>Now, there are a lot of Cthulhu RPG games out there (I wrote <i>Realms of Cthulhu</i> a few years back for Savage Worlds), but I felt that a narratively focused game could explore some of those other, quieter spaces of Lovecraftian horror. When asked to describe tremulus in a nutshell, I say it's Twin Peaks meets Stephen King by way of HPL. Ebon Eaves (the playset town) is weird as are its people, and a slow burn approach provides a lot of tension and possibility. You can certainly ramp it up to more direct conflicts with cultists and Elder Gods and all that, and that's cool, but this is a more intimate experience for me.<br/><br/>As far as rituals go, there are guidelines to handle those, certainly. And they are powered by Lore and the Trust dynamic comes into the equation wherein the person who knows the ritual can use Lore from other characters to aid him, but those other characters can only provide as much Lore as their Trust with the caster, so if a person is sitting on 3 Lore and has a Trust 1, he can only share one Lore. As imagined, this can make some situations a bit dicey, and the person who is most trusted may have to step up and learn the ritual (whether they want to or not).<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Sean<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389287/#Comment_389287" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T06:50:35+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  6:50AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sean, thanks for those details.

It's pretty easy to get hung up on the basic moves, but there's a lot more that goes into making a game (if there wasn't I'd have like a dozen games for sale by now). I think the horror elements are more important than the AW-hack elements, here.

Extensive playtesting really allowed me to tweak Trust to its final state where people use it to drive the narrative and their relationships with one another.<br/><br/>Noofy: Glad to hear it. Trust is used to establish a relationship web as in FATE or Fiasco. The players describe how the characters know each other, and how/why they trust each other. We had considered lists, but making it wide open allows for a lot more ownership on the part(s) of the players, as they get to choose the how and why. In play, this works out similarly to what you see in Fiasco as people determine how much Trust they put in the other characters privately, and then reveal it narratively in a round robin before game play actually begins. Once play is underway, people largely use the Trust value as a guide of whom they hang around and to color their interactions with other characters.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Sean<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/beldar1215" title="beldar1215"><img alt="beldar1215" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/beldar1215">beldar1215</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389445/#Comment_389445" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T13:23:22+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  1:23PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a chance to play tremulus with Sean Preston over this past weekend at TactiCon in Denver. I played in 2 different sessions that each lasted about 2 hours each. I had such a great time. I really wish we had longer to play. This was my first experience playing any type of story-telling game. What a great first experience it turned out to be!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Character creation was very quick and easy. We picked our playbooks, filled out the information on them and we were ready to play. I played the Journalist and the Detective. As expected, both played very differently. I think my favorite part of character creation was the Trust aspect.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Each player is given trust points to spend during creation to start building the story between the different characters. This worked great. I knew right away how I felt about the other characters and this really helped me get into my character.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The town building was also very cool. We used Ebon Eaves as the town for both games. The group answered a number of questions to \u201cbuild\u201d the town. The most interesting thing for me was that the town was completely different for both sessions.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Both of these parts only took about 20 minutes and then we were playing. Both games had their own feel to them. Sean did a great job answering questions about the different moves that you can do during the game. Think \u201cActions\u201d from other games. My two favorites were \u201cPoke Around\u201d and \u201cPuzzle it Out.\u201d The names of all the moves pretty much told you exactly what you could do with them, just by the names.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Will I play more tremulus? You better believe I will.  I\u2019m even hoping to give running the game a chance. It will be a totally new experience for me. Playing the game with Sean made me even happier that I backed the Kickstarter for this.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389456/#Comment_389456" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T16:27:01+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  4:27PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Extensive playtesting really allowed me to tweak Trust to its final state where people use it to drive the narrative and their relationships with one another.</blockquote>\nSean, when you say "extensive playtesting," what do you mean?<br/><br/>How many individual groups have played the game?<br/>How many of those groups played one-shots versus campaigns?<br/>How many of those groups played without you or fellow designers present?<br/><br/>Just curious - in part because I am always curious about the playtesting process and what it looks like for different designers, and in part because that's a deciding factor in whether I support this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389490/#Comment_389490" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T05:16:26+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  5:16AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a data point, I know it's been playtested here in the UK.

The cult in the Kenya section was tiny, the subject of local bedtime stories, until colonial atrocities wrecked the social fabric of the local tribes.  When the characters arrive, the cult has waxed strong by preying on the desperation of the displaced.  The British are neither interested in the cult nor capable of fighting it, so the investigators need to make contact and work with the Africans directly in order to stand a chance.  There's also an extended cameo by Jomo Kenyatta(!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390007/#Comment_390007" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T07:09:48+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  7:09AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, MoN would be an awesome starting place for a Congo playset.

I have already ran a Cthulhu game set in the Congo, but the Frozen Wastes really caught my interest -- stranded scientists or explorers in the middle of Nowhere, Antarctica sounds like a really fun scenario, it is probably the first thing I will try to run with.<br/><br/>As for the decision to remove the Congo setting, I'm cool with it.  A little re-skinning should fix it later on -- drop the specific real world reference, "native guide" might be a better fit than the wild man, or perhaps shaman, or whatever, I don't know the playbook's intended flavor.  Or if it's dropped, it's dropped, ok, no worries.<br/><br/>Side question -- did Lovecraft do any frozen wasteland style stories?  Or at least "stranded out alone" style.  I've only read Call of Cthulhu, Dunwich, and some of the Dreamlands stuff, none of which fits that style -- if I want to run it, I might as well brush up.

Are there dark tribes living in the jungle (which seemed strongly implied from the original pitch)? Cause no matter if they're modeled on real life or not that's still pretty rough. It's still the good guys coming into the benighted jungle where the poor natives mess with things that man was not meant to know. That's still problematic.<br/><br/>Just thinking about a "Mysterious Jungle" you've pretty much narrowed it down to certain parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia (the parts of the world with jungle). It's still Earth.<br/><br/>Unless it wasn't really. Something I mentioned in another thread on this was a Cthluhu game I played in where we ended up in a hot, dark, mysterious jungle... in the Jurassic Period. Due to crazy rituals and blah blah blah we were trying to survive and stop (if I remember correctly) a cult-y Elks Lodge from changing history so that Cthulhu had risen then or whatever. It was great!<br/><br/>Another option would be to ditch the jungle bit, since we tend to associate those kind of jungles with "scary" native tribes and shrunken heads and all that tripe and instead make it be about the dangers of nature itself. If it's about the strange happenings in the woods beyond civilization then we're not leveraging those worn out tribal stereotypes, it could be happening in the forests of New Hampshire or whatever. The important part in this way of doing it I think it shifting it from being about how exotic the location is to being about the primal fears that come with it: darkness, strange noises, big predators, being lost, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390245/#Comment_390245" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T11:26:31+00:00" title="September 14, 2012 11:26AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also might be interesting to meet natives, fear one another at first, and have the actual intrusion of the PCs be the catalyst to awakening the horrors.

That would be a pretty stupid and unsustainable position to hold.<br/><br/>However! <i>In this actual context right here</i>, applying the term Mysterious to jungles and their dark-skinned human inhabitants (especially in 1930s-themed pulp horror) is <i>related</i> to actual, historical and present racist discourses and practices, including (but not limited to): colonialism, neo-colonialism, orientalism, and exoticism. This isn't some kind of made-up lefty nonsense, this is actual historical fact! Part of the way racism works is by constructing people of colour and non-Western places and cultures as MYSTEEEERIOUS and DARRRK and SAAAVAAAGGE and UNTAAAAMED and so on, which makes it a lot easier to paint yourself as superior and go on exploiting them in all kinds of insidious ways.<br/><br/>All I'm saying here is that the (again, 100% reasonable) discomfort people have with this thing has very little to do with whether the playset is based on a specific real-world place or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390319/#Comment_390319" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T01:35:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  1:35AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys, I'm really enjoying hearing about this game and people's impressions of it (since that will, frankly, shape my own opinion and purchasing decisions).

Playsets sound awesome.\n<blockquote>What is a Playset?<br/>At its essence, a playset serves two functions. It provides a context within which to tell a story (the milieu) and serves to define the type of story being told (the framework). <br/><br/><br/>The milieu is defined by the playset itself, be it Ebon Eaves or The Frozen Wasteland. This gives us the general locale in broad, sweeping strokes. It anchors us. Certain particulars are brought center stage depending upon results found in the framework. <br/><br/>The framework is created by answering a series of questions contained with each playset. These answers, in turn, serve to establish threads (1 per set of questions) that are combined to create a unique gaming experience based upon the interplay of the threads. There are other bits contained within the rules which can add even more variation to play. <br/><br/>Within Ebon Eaves, there are two sets of seven questions which serve to define the local color of the town and its town lore. The players answer yes to three of seven questions from each group, creating over a thousand combinations. There is information that is player facing, and provided to them at the start of play, and there is secret information only the Keeper is privy to (which contains what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, as well as establishing the various hazards\u2014the individuals, entities, and obstacles which will be brought into play and operate at cross-purposes with the characters). Some elements are brought into play based upon character choices made before play (for example, if The Heir is in play, there is an ancestral home in the area). <br/><br/>The playset can be used to create short stories or can be used once to create the foundational game space for an ongoing campaign. Because of its ease of use, this can make preparation before play non-existent. However, if a Keeper wants to take some additional time to flesh out the framework, they can certainly do so, and easily have something ready to go in under an hour or take their time to add more detail and potential complexities to the experience as suits the needs (and sensibilities) of their group. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391133/#Comment_391133" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T23:34:27+00:00" title="September 22, 2012 11:34PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.
