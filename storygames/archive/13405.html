I think I started with Tennant's first season when it aired, then simultaneously worked my way forwards and backwards with Tennant, Eccleston and McGann. Then it was Tom Baker time, followed by Hartnell, Davidson, McCoy, Pertwee, Troughton, more or less in that order.<br/><br/>There's something about Tom, no doubt. It doesn't matter how old you are, he has this intoxicating energy onscreen, a mad genius. He is <i>fantastic</i>. Despite that, Sylvester McCoy is my favourite Doctor. Yes, the show was dying when he got on and he had some really shitty scripts to work with, but I just love love love 7th's run.<br/><br/>I'm loving Matt Smith so far, although I'd prefer if they toned down the silly a bit. Especially the console (and don't get me started on the phone). But sometimes I watch old episodes and lament the loss of distilled pulp genius that they contained. <br/><br/>Yeah, I'm a Who nerd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302254/#Comment_302254" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T09:50:29+00:00" title="November 25, 2010  9:50AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2010 12:17PM by NickWedig.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>My first Doctor, too.

He was the one who started me off on Doctor Who back in the day, and he still comprises the largest part of my VHS and DVD collection. He had great lines, great companions, and some truly memorable villains. And some memorable walk-ins, like John Cleese appearing in "City of Death," critiquing the Tardis as a piece of modern art.<br/>It was also cool seeing his cameos here and there, such as the aforementioned episode of Black Adder, and the role he had in one of the BBC versions of Narnia (can't remember which at the moment, since it's been so long).<br/><br/>My favorite line, definitely has to be from "Talons of Weng-Chiang" where he says, "Sleep is for tortoises." I repeated that many a time in university when people would stop by my dorm room to find me still awake, hopped up on Mountain Dew and caffeine pills.<br/><br/>And oddly enough, Sylvester McCoy has to be my second. Yeah, he was given little to work with, some crappy scripts, and he started off with one of the crappiest companions. But McCoy's charisma almost helped to keep the show alive, with his impish little grin and bumbling ways. Almost as if you took Patrick Troughton and merged him with a bit of Tom Baker.<br/>And, after meeting him in person in Seattle earlier this year, my respect for him has grown immensely. I look forward to his role in "The Hobbit."<br/><br/>I'd probably enjoy the new series if it WASN'T for Amy Pond (who seems to be the main star, instead of Matt Smith), and some of the ludicrous ways they solve things (really? Telling the Dalek-cyborg scientist to remember his past to disarm the bomb?

Seven years compared to the two or three most other actors brought to the part.  It is pretty impressive that the quality stayed pretty even during his run.  I have as many favorites from the beginning, middle and end of his stint.<br/><br/>Sylvester McCoy is towards the top of my list simply because the chemistry between his Doctor and Ace was so strong.  He was also the first Doctor that I got to see as new episodes all in the right order as opposed to the jumbled PBS re-run scheduling of the others.  Until the restart I never got the jonesing for the next episode feeling that I got with every other TV show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit" title="NCLivingBrit"><img alt="NCLivingBrit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit">NCLivingBrit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303167/#Comment_303167" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T20:13:09+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  8:13PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was 9yrs old I harassed my mother into taking me to London to get my Dr Who book signed.  The ever-awesome Mr Baker made a drunken pass at my mother so leering and bold that I almost cried.  My book was signed and he was very pleasant to me, but the autograph was basically a wobbly line due to tedium, hand cramp and a copious amount of booze.  Gotta love 'im <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso two Dutch girls made me videotape them committing what would usually be considered a "bad touch" on Gareth Thomas and Paul Darrow (Blake and Avon from Blake's Seven) at a DVD signing in Stevenage (my squalid little hometown).  Extra fun fact:  I was only there because my best friend Nat had to work and HAD to have Paul Darrow's autograph due to a huge Avon fancrush.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303204/#Comment_303204" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T08:57:05+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  8:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tom Baker was great, but the other Doctors shouldn't be judged by comparison to him.
