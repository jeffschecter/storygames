We're really digging it ! I hope others have tried it and will share their experiences. <br/><br/>We've played three one-shots, each lasting between two and three hours. To work within that time frame, we tweak the rules - there's no secondary sanity roll; if you use your sanity die and it increments on the initial role, that stands. This tends to ratchet up sanity loss, which works perfectly for our style of play. Someone typically goes insane, and everyone gets close, in a one-shot using this variant. Recommended!<br/><br/>Something that should be in the basic rules, I think - prior to play, the GM asks a few questions, and the soon-to-be players answer via email. Here's my Q&amp;A from the most recent session:\n<blockquote><b>QUESTIONS FOR MARWAN HADDAD<br/><br/>.....What's your specialty on the DSMC team?</b><br/>I'm the MSO, Medical Safety Officer. My job is to oversee DSMC crew health and workplace safety compliance, as well as ECLS (Environmental<br/>Control and Life Support) functions. I am not a doctor. More of a spacesuit mechanic with a bag of medication.<br/><br/><b>.....Why did you join the DSMC?</b><br/>I washed out in my third year of medical school deeply in debt. What else was I going to do?<br/><br/><b>.....Who on the station, besides the DSMC team, do you have a close attachment to?</b><br/>My sister, Samiyah Rowley, is a big-shot researcher on the station. She's apparently principal investigator on some big deal discovery<br/>that hasn't been published yet and is therefore very hush-hush. <br/><br/><b>...There's someone on Everest you don't like, who is it? Why are you at odds with this person?</b><br/>Gunnery Sergeant Darden Rowley, my brother-in-law, in charge of the small Marine security unit assigned to the station. He's a redneck<br/>jackhole not worthy of my sister. I sort of dread bumping into him.</blockquote>\nThis is enough information to jump-start relationships and give the GM plenty to work with. In the one I ran, I asked "what is something about (the session's setting) that makes you <i>as a player</i> uncomfortable?" With this sort of information, you don't need to do a ton of prep. We have not tried yet, but we're all in agreement that Cthulhu Dark will work well with no prep at all as a GM improv game, probably best augmented by pre-session questions.<br/><br/>We've played two ways with die values - in one way, the degree of success on sanity and harm dice is tied directly into the fiction, and in the other, it isn't so much. I think I prefer the latter. In last night's session, the first time my guy made a sanity roll it turned up a 6, so the expectation was that he'd have a dramatic breakdown and lose his shit in the most extreme fashion. The timing felt off for this and I wished I had more control over how the mental break happened. You can see this with harm as well. I think if you play without regard to magnitude, players can tailor the fiction appropriately and with more ease. This highlights the fact that Cthulhu Dark, being a very simple rules-set, positively demands drifting to suit local play styles.<br/><br/>What has your experience been?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323721/#Comment_323721" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T06:01:16+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  6:01AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've only played it with Graham so we've stuck religiously to the rules as printed, Graham pointing us to the exact paragraph each time we stray,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323724/#Comment_323724" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T06:11:24+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  6:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slightly more seriously, I've been using it for playtesting Unspeakable Oath scenarios. There's a much lower burden regarding character generation and we can start almost immediately. That's very refreshing. Even when using pre-written scenarios, there is a need for the GM to improvise information on high rolls 5 or 6 and this makes it much more tailored to the characters than you might otherwise expect. I could quite easily see some of his responsibility being shifted to players if you wanted to be more improvised. As such Cthulhu Dark is good for sandbox/improvised play because it gives some structure to the improvisation.<br/><br/>I think it's perfect for one shot games (of which I've run three and played two I think). It works fine in Gaslight, Trail and Delta Green settings.<br/><br/>It doesn't work well for all players, particularly those who are prone to a very wide interpretation of their character's capabilities. There isn't any capability for advancement and there isn't much scope for specialisation. If I were running a longer set of adventures, I think I'd prefer to use a more structured game like GUMSHOE. I ran three DG one shots with the same characters and by the end they all started to seem a bit samey (the characters). I suspect that you need to define them more with external things, such as your questions above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323729/#Comment_323729" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T07:49:48+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  7:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some things I've been considering doing with Cthulhu Dark for my group:<br/>Instead of just the character's "occupation," have the "occupation" and three or four defining details about it. Is your character a Professor? A Professor of what academic specialty? Does he have tenure? etc. This, I feel, helps take away from the "sameness" that some players feel.<br/>Also, I had been thinking about hacking Hx from Apocalypse World for Cthulhu Dark. Just having a list of potential past events that players can choose from when fleshing out their relationships with the other PCs, like "[Blank] stole my girl/boyfriend," "A professional rivalry with [Blank]," or "Why does [Blank] always get on my nerves?"<br/>That, or maybe use the seven questions from <i>Death Takes a Holiday</i> to kind of build-in details to the relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323737/#Comment_323737" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T08:51:24+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  8:51AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We use the dice themselves to track sanity and harm, so anything that adds a record-keeping burden doesn't appeal to me.

I'm delighted with the way Cthulhu Dark has turned out.<br/><br/><b>Hacking it</b><br/><br/>Awesome, go ahead, tell me how it goes.<br/><br/><b>Questions during character creation</b><br/><br/>I do something very similar. It's more informal, but I ask people a few questions at the table, until I feel we all know who the character is. Why did you leave the army? Do you enjoy nursing?<br/><br/>And they are specific to the situation, too. We're playing through Cthulhu Apocalypse, at the moment, and the characters have a stronghold in a cave. So how often do you see the sunlight? Do you like living underground? Who checks the radio? And then I got the leader to assign everyone duties.<br/><br/>Basically, I think Cthulhu Dark trust you to use your own procedures for fleshing out the characters. You could equally use a Breaking The Ice-style word assocation thing. Or Michael's Apocalypse World hack, which would work really well.<br/><br/>Really, I think we've got tools to build relationship maps and I don't necessarily want to invent a whole new set.<br/><br/><b>Degrees of success on sanity dice</b><br/><br/>I agree. If you roll a 6, it just means your Insanity goes up, not that you freak out. (How much you freak out depends on the situation.)<br/><br/><b>Character differentiation</b><br/><br/>This usually works really well for me. In fact, defining characters by occupation differentiates them really well: you get an automatic stereotype to use.<br/><br/>I think the problem is Delta Green. Delta Green is its own thing. I haven't quite worked out how to do Delta Green yet.<br/><br/><b>Harm dice</b><br/><br/>I totally haven't worked out how to use them, but apparently Jason has.<br/><br/><b>Campaign play</b><br/><br/>This is the next big thing, for me. I haven't quite worked it out. We're playing through a huge campaign, at the moment, and slowly tweaking the system.<br/><br/>One useful thing is: reset Insanity to 1 <i>at the start of each session</i> (not at the start of each scenario within the campaign). It lets characters stay sane longer. Besides, I like the basic unit of Cthulhu Dark being the session. It feels right.<br/><br/>Advancement is more of a problem. There's got to be a way, but I haven't worked it out yet. It's got to be double-edged. Like...you write down the thing that scared you most about a scenario...then you get an extra die for it...but you must make an Insanity roll. Not quite that. But close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323881/#Comment_323881" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T04:56:59+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  4:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 4:57AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We treat harm just like sanity.
