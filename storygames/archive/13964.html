My friend Gary and I were into Fighting Fantasy books, and made a zine about that. It was called "Centaur Lord", and we xeroxed it at his mom's office. Two issues were made. We sold two copies of each, I think; to his mom, and to an older friend who was into D&amp;D.<br/><br/>At some point when I was around seventeen I tried making a new zine. However, a pretty girl laughed at the name, and and older friend didn't want to contribute, so nothing happened.<br/><br/>A few years later I got serious and made a literary zine called Giger. I paid for copying costs at the place I was working. We had color covers. It was sold at a few random caf\xe9s, I think. We printed things I'm glad nobody can read on the internet now. A wonderful way of publishing things; you send it out into The Big World, while at the same time, it's just a tiny, tiny little world.<br/><br/>Then I got back into gaming and started Imagonem. That went on for twenty-something issues, I think, before I dropped out. It had a hiatus while I was in Australia for a year (though other editors published one issue that year). It became a central thing in the tiny Norwegian roleplaying scene. Imagonem still runs as a web site, under Anders Nygaard's control. <br/><br/>Now I'm all grown up and call my new fanzine a "magazine". Which it is. But it's the same thing. Nobody gets paid. Our sponsors pay more, we have better quality paper, much better writing, actual real  photographs. The people who buy it are the people who made and bought fanzines ten or fifteen years ago. <br/><br/>The guy I made Imagonem with back then, Audun Lindholm, is now the editor of Norway's most prestigious literary magazine.<br/><br/>I have a collection of old paper in my cupboard. Shelves of old fanzines and magazines. Cryptych. Alarums &amp; Excursions. The Familiar. Swedish and Danish and Norwegian zines that most Swedes and Danes and Norwegians have never heard of.<br/><br/>The people who made them are now... all over the place. Some are in Playground. Some are well-known game designers (especially from A&amp;E). Some are larp organizers, festival organizers etc. Some are professional comic book artists. Some are authors. Some, I have no idea at all.<br/><br/>I love zines.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316382/#Comment_316382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T09:18:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  9:18AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same, x 24 hundred thousand.<br/><br/>Zines are real to me in a way that the internet still isn't.

I published a zine that made it to eight issues. The first issue was called the (eco)terrorist, but the post office intercepted the copy I sent to my Grandma and opened it. They thought it was a bomb threat and wrote my Grandma a note saying why they opened it. I changed the name to the Plywood Review. I sold it through a couple of stores but never came out ahead.<br/><br/>I also published a zine called the <a href="http://www.emptygamebox.com/empty/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/bookofgraph.zip" rel="nofollow">Book of Graph</a>. I made several 100 copies and pinned them to bulletin boards and left them places all up and down the U.S's east coast and Midwest.<br/><br/>Since I live in the middle of nowhere now, I don't get to see zines very often, but I purchased one via the main recently.

But depending on where you live, sometimes you have to know where to look. New York, I have heard, is a hot-bed of zines (though I cannot say from first-hand experience), but its not like it's going to be available in every coffee shop or college campus. In my area (Pacific NW), zines can be found all over the place. Our biggest and greatest bookstore, Powells, has a crazy selection of zines. But I never knew too much about zines until I went to summer classes at Portland State.<br/><br/>I am in with the Zine lovin'.<br/><br/>EDIT: So, no, it's not that you're the wrong age or wrong coolness experience level... Hell, I'm nearly 35, and only been into zines for a decade or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316870/#Comment_316870" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T16:42:52+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  4:42PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jacob</cite>I've never read a 'zine'.

A simple Google search should be able to drum up some possibilities in your area.

I grew up an hour west of Philadelphia, and didn't know about zines until I got into punk. It wasn't that I moved to a new zine-oriented place, but just that I located myself within a zine-oriented social group.

Though I guess Imagonem was my first and nearly only.<br/><br/>I love seeing what people bring in, what they have to say, and I love wondering if they share the same rush as me at seeing words and pictures, so ephemeral and fleeting on a screen, become solid, real print. Some sort of magic in that. Should be sleeping now, but just finished setting up a kinda-sorta layout for the paper issue of Imagonem on a borrowed mac (someone loves that mac. It has been patched together in several places, and a false moustache adorns the top of the screen. I was instructed to call it Snow White and give it a hug if it gave me trouble). I'm expecting some sort of horrible technical problem to ruin the last shreds of schedule tomorrow, but such is the way of things.<br/><br/>I was a lot younger than most of the guys who turned up to do the zine. For some reason, I was not just welcomed, but made to feel like an equal part in the editor group. Or maybe I was just a typical 17-year old socially oblivious nerd. I guess we got the name from Matthijs, the vision from Johannes, and the style from a strange mix of hopes, expectations and arcane internet wall-scrawlings. We scrounged up text and images from anyone and everyone we knew. For me, it was a completely new thing. I didn't know the history, the tricks or the language of zinemaking, and got my educaction as we went along. I could draw a bit, and write a bit, and did my best at what I was told to do, absorbing bits and pieces of layout lore, bureaucrat-fu, roleplaying trivia and general geekery without really knowing how it all fitted together.<br/><br/>As the original editorial group started fading out, there were always new, or new-old people turning up, and I was getting to know them and the stuff they wrote. I never did any of the really cool stuff myself - I didn't call up Gary Gygax and get an interview, I didn't almost fill the whole magazine with a strange and stirring railroad game about Christ returning as a junkie, and I didn't write the first history of gaming in Norwegian. But to be there for those things, and help them get to print, was amazing. I'm not sure I could stop trying to do more of it if I wanted to, even though we're down to less than one issue a year.<br/><br/>Hey... this might do for an editorial.
